                    "value": "Tropical Storm Elsa continues to track toward New Jersey and is expected to bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph starting Thursday evening and into Friday morning. A flash flood watch has been issued with about half the state likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\nTropical Storm Elsa could bring up to 4 inches of rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph to parts of New Jersey, particularly along the Jersey Shore, starting Thursday evening and continuing into Friday morning, prompting a flash flood watch for the entire state.\nThe tropical storm watch issued by the National Weather Service on Wednesday was upgraded Thursday morning to a tropical storm warning for coastal counties \u2014 Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth, Ocean and southeastern Burlington, which are expected to see the highest wind gusts.\nTropical Storm Elsa continues to track toward New Jersey and is expected to bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph starting Thursday and into Friday. A flash flood watch has been issued with about half the state likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\nThe latest forecast calls for areas south and east of the I-95 corridor to see 2 to 4 inches of rain, with gusts between 40 and 60 mph, while the rest of the state is expected to get 1 to 2 inches of rain.\n\u201cHeavy rainfall leading to flash flooding is our primary concern with this storm,\u201d the weather service said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, a flash flood watch has been issued for the entire (state).\u201d\nSome localized rainfall totals could hit 6 inches, the weather service said.\nTropical Storm Elsa continues to track toward New Jersey and is expected to bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph starting Thursday and into Friday. A flash flood watch has been issued with about half the state likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\nPrior to Elsa\u2019s arrival, New Jersey could get some rain showers and thunderstorms Thursday afternoon because of a trough moving in from the Great Lakes region, unrelated to the tropical storm.\nThe weather service said New Jersey could be hit with tropical storm-force winds as early Thursday night, followed by heavy rains, dangerous rip currents and seas swelling 6 to 9 feet above normal.\nTropical storm-force winds are possible for coastal New Jersey, portions of the eastern shore of Maryland, southern Delaware, and marine areas to include lower Delaware Bay, the weather service said.\n\u201cThe greatest threat for tropical storm force winds will be along the coast and marine areas. However, there is a chance these strong winds could reach farther inland,\u201d the weather service said.\nTropical Storm Elsa continues to track toward New Jersey and is expected to bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph starting Thursday and into Friday. A flash flood watch has been issued with about half the state likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\nRain from Elsa will continue into Friday as the storm continues its march along the coast and into New England. High temperatures both Thursday and Friday are expected to remain in the 80s, providing some relief from the past few days of high heat.\nSome lingering showers are expected into Friday evening as the storm departs.\nTropical Storm Elsa continues to track toward New Jersey and is expected to bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 60 mph starting Thursday and into Friday. A flash flood watch has been issued with about half the state likely to get 2 to 4 inches of rain.\nElsa made landfall along Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast on Wednesday. The storm killed at least one person in Florida on Wednesday when a tree fell and struck two cars, and injured several others when a possible tornado struck a campground at a Navy base in southeast Georgia.\nNew Jersey has been dealing with high heat and thunderstorms throughout the week with the most serious storms hitting the state Tuesday night into Wednesday. More than 5,000 homes and business remain without power as of 7 a.m. Thursday morning.\nAfter a relatively quiet weather day on Saturday, more unsettled weather is in the forecast for Sunday and the start of next week when high temperatures climb back up to around 90 degrees.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

                    "value": "Boris Johnson has warned it will be \"a difficult year for travel\" regardless of whether he presses ahead with plans to allow fully-vaccinated adults to travel without quarantine.\nThe Prime Minister told reporters that he was keen to do what he could for those who have both jabs, noting : \"Everyone over 50 should have been offered their second jab... I think almost 60 per cent of adults have had two jabs, so when it come to travel, we will certainly be looking at that.\"\nBut he added: \"I want to stress that this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel. There will be hassle, there will be delays. But our priority has got to be to stop virus coming back in. We are looking at it, but our emphasis is going on making sure protect the country.\"\nThe Prime Minister also said that July 19 was \"looking good\" for the final stage of reopening, but warned of a \"rough winter\" to come, as fears grow that restrictions could be reimposed later in the year.\nSpeaking to journalists during a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire, the Prime Minister admitted \"you can never exclude that there will be some new disease, some new horror that we simply haven't budgeted for, or accounted for\".\nHe added that the risk of flu combined with Covid meant \"we may have a rough winter for all sorts of reasons\".\n\u200b\u200bFollow the latest updates below.\nTory MP Jack Lopresti MP says the government target of building 300,000 additional homes a year is not \u201canywhere near enough\u201d to address the housing crisis.\nHe says that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that most young people cannot aspire to get on the housing ladder without family help or inheritance.\nHe says \u201cit is not morally right, nor is it sustainable,\u201d adding that it is vital to increase the supply of homes.\u201d\nTory MP Simon Clarke tells the Commons the Chesham and Amersham by-election was \"won in the very worst spirit.\u201d\nHe said Lib Dems were \u201cpandering to NIMBYism, denying the growing social injustice,\u201d and \u201cprivileging the interests of the haves over the have nots in our society.\u201d\nConservative Sir Bob Neill, MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, said the Government needed to \"make sure that we are efficient, but not at the expense of local democracy\".\nHe said: \"We need also to recognise that that cannot come at the expense of the right of communities to have a say in how those very communities in which they live, in which they have put down their roots, in which they have a stake are developed.\n\"So I have a word of caution to the minister about how we approach that in terms of the role of the individual objector and the role of the local authority in the planning process. It's a democratic issue and we have to make sure that we are efficient, but not at the expense of local democracy.\"\nTory MP Bob Seely urged the government to work with communities rather than treating them as the \u201cplanning equivalent of a foie gras goose\u201d with housing shoved down them.\nReferring to a report he says the current housing methodology \u201csystematically disadvantages poorer parts of the country\u201d, particularly in the North and Midlands.\nHe adds: \"We are actively depriving the red wall of investment,\u201d adding that \u201cit is like a planning wall of doom.\u201d\nConservative William Wragg (Hazel Grove) said that MPs who have \"scepticism\" about the planning reforms are not \"Nimbys\" or \"Bananas\".\nSpeaking in the Commons Mr Wragg said: \"We're not Nimbys, that's not the accusation that should be thrown at those of us who might have some scepticism about some of the ideas that have been ventured forth.\n\"Nor indeed are we Bananas, that is to say 'build absolutely nothing anywhere near anybody'.\n\"What we want to see is a planning process, although some people might disagree, what we want to see is a planning process that involves and engages people and delivers the housing that we most certainly need.\"\nLabour MP Helen Hayes has criticised the government for being \u201cutterly negligent\u201d in its planning regulations.\nShe told the Commons: \u201cInstead of treating the planning system as inconvenient red-tape to be swept away as much as possible, the government should be seeking to make it fit for purpose for the challenges of the 21st century.\u201d\nThe MP for Dulwich and West Norwood said from 2010 onwards there has been a \u201cbonfire of planning regulations\u201d which saw the removal of design standards, calling it \u201ca decade of lost time.\u201d\nChristopher Pincher, Housing Minister, says Labour do not want young people to get onto the housing ladder.\nHe says: \"They don\u2019t like aspiration, they don\u2019t like capitalism and they don\u2019t want people to aspire or to be capitalists.\u201c\nHe adds: \u201cWell we have something to say to that Madam Deputy Speaker, it begins with a B. It\u2019s Bol...-shevism to that.\u201d\nLabour has threatened to bring forward its own legislation to incentivise developers to build homes more quickly, Christopher Hope reports .\nSteve Reed, shadow Housing secretary, told the House of Commons: \"These proposals are nothing less than a developers' charter that silences local communities so that developers can exploit local communities for profit.\"\nMinisters should focus on building \"a strong partnership between councils, communities and developers - that is how we get new homes built where people need them.\"\nMr Reed conceded there are \"real problems\" with the planning system, but he added: \"The problem with getting homes built is not the planning process - it is developers who don't build the homes once they get consent.\"\nHousing Minister Christopher Pincher tells the Commons we need a \u201ctransparent, engaging and modern\u201d housing system that offers everyone in the country the chance to get on the housing ladder.\nHe defends the current planning reforms as a \u201csensible set of proposals\u201d to address the failures of the English planning system.\nHe says at the moment planning is \u201ctoo slow, too difficult to navigate and too off putting\u201d for the majority of people.\nThe Conservatives lost Chesham and Amersham for two reasons: HS2 and planning reform. HS2 - love it or loathe it - we can no longer do anything about, writes Bob Seely.\nWe can, however, do something about our planning reforms; we can get them them right.\nSo why are Tory MPs worried? Because we are reflecting the concerns of many of our constituents from across the political spectrum and age groups.\nFirst, the Government wants to remove a critical layer of local democracy from the planning process. This is wrong. Ripping up people's right to object is a fool's errand. Post-Brexit, we need to be empowering communities, not emasculating them.\nRead Bob's entire column here.\nDominic Cummings has denied allegations that he made a second trip to Durham during the first lockdown.\nAsked to clarify whether he breached Covid rules for a second time by visiting Durham in April 2020, the former aide said he \"did not go back to Durham\".\nHe replied: \"I was in London on 19th and with my son on Hampstead Heath, and phone data proves it.\"\nThe Government is prepared to look at \"more fundamental changes to the criminal justice system\" if proposals from the rape review \"do not yield sufficient change\", the Justice Secretary has said.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons Robert Buckland said: \"I want to reassure the House that if the proposed actions do not yield sufficient change in the time scales we have set out, then the Government is prepared to look at more fundamental changes to the criminal justice system, including measures to strengthen accountability and governance more widely.\n\"The review represents just the beginning of this work, we must continue to challenge the entire system to deliver urgent and sustained change.\n\"We owe that to every victim of these terrible crimes, every part of the system can and must do better. Now is the time for it to deliver.\"\nA new independent process is to be set up by the end of this year to investigate complaints against ministers and former ministers, Nicola Sturgeon has announced.\nThe First Minister said her Government was \"determined to learn\" from the way in which sexual harassment allegations against Alex Salmond were handled.\nA ruling by the Court of Session that the Scottish Government had acted unlawfully in the way it dealt with these claims resulted in the former first minister being awarded a payout of more than \u00a3500,000.\nThe Government is facing friendly fire from Tory MPs who fear that a raid on pensions will lead to further Chesham and Amersham-style defeats at the ballot box.\nWhile the triple lock is thought to be safe, meaning those on state pensions will be protected, higher earners are in the spotlight with the proposals including a cut to the lifetime allowance from a little above \u00a31 million to \u00a3800,000 or \u00a3900,000, realigning the tax rate or a new tax on employer contributions.\nWhile the economy is fragile, and unemployment expected to affect the youngest workers, is this a fair way to restore public finances? Have your say in the poll below.\nThe UK has added several senior Belarusian officials and entities, including an exporter of oil products, to its sanctions list as part of a coordinated move with allies.\nSeven individuals and one organisation had been sanctioned over the diversion of the Ryanair flight, while four individuals and an entity had been sanctioned over human rights abuses in Belarus by Alexander Lukashenko's regime.\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"The UK and our partners have today sanctioned those responsible for the continued suppression of democracy and human rights in Belarus.\n\"The Lukashenko regime endangered the lives of airline passengers and crew in a shameful ruse to snatch Roman Protasevich.\n\"We will hold the regime to account in co-ordination with our allies including through further banning travel, freezing assets and cutting off oil export revenue streams.\"\nDominic Cummings has warned that if a foreign country gets Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or close to it \"they may have the power to subdue everyone - and destroy us all\".\nThe former aide said AGI could \"easily be much worse than even total nuclear war\" and ought to be \"a massive focus of government thinking but it is not\".\nHe added: \"NOTHING like this now will get serious focus in no10 - no10 now is just a branch of entertainment industry and will stay so til BJ gone, at earliest.\n\"The most valuable commodity in gvt is focus and the PM literally believes that focus is a menace to his freedom to do whatever he fancies today, hence why you see the opposite of focus now and will do til he goes...\"\nDominic Cummings has not ruled out a return to Government - despite being highly critical of pretty much everyone who might form one.\nAs well as attacking Boris Johnson and several ministers, Mr Cummings has made it clear he has little respect for the leader of the opposition Sir Keir Starmer.\nBut asked if he would make a comeback, and if he could be trusted, he replied: \"All depends... I think I can be trusted to behave in certain ways and optimise for certain goals more than most people in politics!\n\"Though this is of course part of the problem, most in SW1 do not want this, they want people optimising for 'climbing party hierarchy'.\"\nJust pulling away from Dominic Cummings to return to the Commons now, where Gavin Williamson has been getting a kicking from Labour - and members of his own party.\nFormer minister Theresa Villiers warned the \"very survival\" of maintained nursery schools was \"now in jeopardy\" due to the lack of a long-term financial settlement.\nThe MP for Chipping Barnet said: \"We need that long-term settlement and even more urgently we need a consultation on reallocating supplementary funding so areas like Barnet that have got zero from that funding can actually receive some of it as an interim solution to keep them above water until we get that settlement.\"\nVicky Ford, children and families minister, insisted the Government was \"committed to their long-term funding and to reaching a long-term solution by working with the sector. Any reform to their funding will follow a public consultation.\"\nDominic Cummings has defended his decision to hire Andrew Sabisky as one of his 'weirdos and misfits', despite the adviser having to resign for comments including the \"very real racial differences in intelligence\".\nAsked what was his 'takeaway' from the row, which blew up last February as the pandemic was spreading through Europe, the former chief of staff said: \"If you want to have people who spot errors/groupthink etc on high stakes decisions, you can't worry re social media posts from young people.\n\"Are we goign to ostracise everybody who wrote something dumb aged 15? Also the 'eugenics' stuff you read in papers is b-------.\"\nDominic Cummings has said \"all the parties are rotten to the core\" as he confirmed he does \"not think of myself as a Conservative\".\nThe former right-hand man to Boris Johnson suggested that Labour should \"kick Tories up and down the street on violent crime, but Starmer is fixated on media/bubble, he won't re-orient to public.\"\nHowever he claimed political parties were \"old decrepit entities literally dying on their feet, but they control the rules so they stop startups taking them down! This is a critical problem, maybe THE critical problem, even bigger than MSM.\"\nDominic Cummings has urged MPs to ensure plans for future preparedness in areas such as PPE are published to avoid being \"Hancocked again\".\nResponding to a question about planning for future pandemics the former chief aide, who has been waging a war against the Health Secretary in recent months said he had \"started work on building the production/supply chains etc for this last summer but I don't know the current status\".\nHe added: \"MPs shd be demanding all such plans ARE PUBLISHED cos otherwise we're likely to get Hancocked again.\"\nDominic Cummings has said \"new forms of media\" should be accelerated, as he continues his war on lobby journalists.\nDuring a wide-ranging Q&A with subscribers to his Substack account, the former chief aide hailed Vote Leave's victory as \"precisely because we did not orient to media but to our best guess of reality - and ditto we won the political game in 2019 for the same reason\".\nIn response to a question about the woke influence on media, he added: \"People are always asking me about 'campaigns' but what they really mean is 'talking to the media' and of course the media are themselves, obliviously, the main problem! Supposedly 'right' papers are populated by people who are in the grip of childish ideas cos they pick up opinions like clothes - fashion...\n\"We need new forms of media... This will happen 'naturally' but we shd try to accelerate it.\" (Sic throughout)\nDominic Cummings has said working in the heart of Government was \"fascinating but very troubling\", as he tells subscribers that if the public could see what goes on \"everyone would sell everything and head for the bunker in the hills\".\nThe former chief aide, who has thrown open his Substack for a wide ranging Q&A with paying readers, says: \"It's impossible to describe how horrific decision-making is at the apex of power and how few people watching it have any clue how bad it is or any sense of how to do it better, it's generally the blind leading the blind with a few non-blind desperately shoving fingers in dykes and clutching their heads.\"\nAsked which country he would move to because it has the best-run government, Mr Cummings replies: \"Purely from perspective of competent govt Singapore hard to beat.\"\nDominic Cummings has said a \"'smash the rich' agenda would be popular\", as he predicts the Government \"will struggle to cut spending with Boris Johnson\" at the helm.\nThe former aide complained about waste, highlighting HS2 as an example, contrasting this with a reluctance to raise taxes.\nHe noted there were \"unjustified subsidies for rich in detail of pensions/capital gains that I'm in favour of removing\", but added: \"In general though Tory MPs talk to think tanks re cutting, they panic as soon as the media screams.\n\"There's no doubt that a 'smash the rich' agenda wd be popular! Think Gates, S Sumner and others raise interesting Qs re consumption tax.\"\nDominic Cummings has also hit back at the \"incompetent and confused\" Electoral Commission, saying the body \"totally botched\" its investigation into campaign spending.\nSpeaking to journalist Carole Cadwalladr, the former Vote Leave director says: \"Whether Brexit is 'worth it' is in our hands... If we use the control we now have to do things like bin the EU procurement system that directly contributed to many deaths, and which I had to try to subvert to save lives repeatedly, then it will be worth it.\n\"And to bring in a serious immigration policy that comman[d]s widespread support, makes it easier for hi[gh] skilled people etc... Which is pretty easy to do if we want to...\n\"If it just means the same parties and same civil service dicking around for 20 years, then whether that's 'worth it' will depend on what the Eurozone does.\"\nDominic Cummings has already begun responding to questions on his blog - and, as he promised, the topics are wide ranging.\nThe former chief aide has even tackled questions posed by the Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr about his 'secretive' work for Vote Leave.\nHe tells her that in \"2015-16 my main problem was Tory MPs, Farage etc -- NOT Remain, BSE, Cameron etc\", which is why he had to keep his \"polling/modelling\" quiet \"partly because some of them were spies for Osborne, others leaked everything.\"\nMr Cummings adds: \"There was a cell within a cell, a campaign within a campaign - I kept much secret on polls/models/adverts etc from the VL Board / campaign commitee. This imposed very high costs on my time but was necessary. I put Scotland at the top of all agendas so they wd talk about that and forget about data...\nLabour has clearly been spooked by the Chesham and Amersham result last week, because the planning issue appears to have been made front and centre.\nIt's an interesting pivot given the party's support heavily relies on young people who have been priced out of property ownership.\nLabour has accused the Government of wanting to \"gag residents from objecting to oversized developments in their own street\" ahead of the party's opposition day debate today.\nSteve Reed, shadow housing and communities secretary, said the planning reform \"takes away the rights of local people to object to developments that may be happening tin their localities\".\nPreet Kaur Gill, shadow international secretary, added: \"Planning is only successful when developers and communities work together to join local knowledge with project expertise.\"\nThis debate will take place this afternoon, with a vote this evening. Tories are expected to abstain, despite their own deeply held objections to the proposals.\nDowning Street has denied that the G7 summit in Cornwall was responsible for an increase in coronavirus cases in the area.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said it had always been expected that cases across the country would rise following the last easing of lockdown restrictions in England in May.\n\"Attendees going to the G7 were tested before arriving and throughout the summit. We are not aware of any cases of transmission to local residents,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We always said that, following the move to step three (of the Government's road map out of lockdown), we would see cases rising across the country. That is what we are seeing playing out.\"\nEM Forster spent his life arguing for the need to connect, but when a New Town was planned at Stevenage in 1946, moving thousands of those same workers into the Home Counties he grew up in, he had to think twice, writes Tim Stanley.\n\u201cIt is a collision of loyalties\u201d, he wrote. \u201cPeople must have houses [but] I cannot free myself from the conviction that something irreplaceable has been destroyed and that a little piece of England has died as surely as if a bomb had hit it.\u201d\nIn short, not in my back yard. And he had a point. We have to share the good life to give people a stake in it, but share it too much and it\u2019s no longer so good.\nThe residents of Chesham and Amersham fear they\u2019ll be next, which is one reason \u2013 that and opposing the asinine HS2 project \u2013 why they humiliated the Government in a by-election last week.\nRead the rest of Tim's column here.\nThe successor to the Royal Yacht Britannia will be paid for out of the Ministry of Defence's budget, Downing Street said.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters: \"This new national flagship will boost British trade and drive investment into the economy. The procurement process, which is being done through the MoD, will reflect its wide-ranging use and so it will be funded through the MoD, as set out previously.\"\nThe No 10 spokesman declined to comment on how the MoD could afford a yacht costing a reported \u00a3200 million, given its own equipment budget blackhole of \u00a317 billion.\nPressed on reports the vessel could be classified as a \"warship\" and could have guns attached, Boris Johnson's spokesman said: \"We will set out the exact detail in due course but this is a trade ship, it is not a military vessel.\"\nSee 12:30pm and 8:13am for more.\nDowning Street has played down suggestions the planned lifting of lockdown in England could be brought forward from July 19.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said that while there would be a two-week review of the data, currently cases were continuing to rise.\n\"We will monitor case data day by day to see if moving forward after two weeks is possible,\" the spokesman said.\n\"You'll see the data we are looking at - 10,000 cases recorded for the third day in a row on Saturday which is the highest level since February 2.\n\"The seven-day average for hospitalisations also continues to rise. ICU intake is also rising.\"\nThat chimes with comments made by Boris Johnson (see 11:51am) and Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary (see 8:01am).\nCross-party talks on social care reforms will take place once the proposals have been revealed, Downing Street has suggested.\n\"When we set out our proposals, we will set out our path forward from that point,\" the Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters after being asked when talks might start.\nThe spokesman said he would not be drawn on how much the changes could cost or whether taxes would have to rise to pay for them, following reports the reforms could cost \u00a310 billion annually to fund.\nAsked how the reforms will be paid for, Mr Johnson's spokesman said: \"The right way to do this would be to set out the proposals and how they would be costed at the same time.\"\nDowning Street has said the Government was \"fully committed\" to the triple-lock on pensions, and that there will be no raise to income tax to pay for the cost of Covid.\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"We are committed to the triple lock. It is important to say that the final figures are still unclear and the uprating work takes place in the annual review, which takes place later this year.\"\nAsked whether the review gave the Treasury \"wriggle room\", the spokesman added: \"We're just simply making the point that there is significant uncertainty around the trajectory of average earnings and whether there will be the spike that has been forecasted.\"\nPressed on the possibility of a one-year suspension of the triple lock to take into account artificial wage inflation after furlough ends, Mr Johnson's spokesman said: \"We are fully committed to the pensions triple lock.\"\nAndy Burnham has hit back at Nicola Sturgeon for suggesting he was confecting a row over the travel ban ahead of a Labour leadership challenge (see 11:20am).\nThe Mayor of Greater Manchester said: \"I find that insulting, not for me, but for people here who are directly affected by what she announced. It's not just the direct impact on Greater Manchester, it's on our reputation as a city.\"\nHe added: \"I don't think we've been treated with the respect we deserve and I'm talking mainly there of the people of Greater Manchester, not myself. It's had a real impact. It's had an impact with people with holiday cottages booked, people who are having to go for work reasons.\n\"So to suggest, as the First Minister has done today, 'Oh, this is all about politics and posturing', well say that to them, say that to those people. Why is Bolton under a travel ban today, when it has a case rate that is quite a lot lower than Dundee? How is that fair?\"\nThe new Liberal Democrat MP for Chesham and Amersham has pledged to work \"for all\" her constituents, ahead of being sworn into the House of Commons this afternoon.\nSarah Green, who overturned a massive 16,000 Conservative Party majority last week, will formally join her colleagues at 2:30pm this afternoon.\nShe said: \"The people of Chesham and Amersham will no longer be taken for granted. I will fight everyday for our community, our environment, and most of all, those who have been ignored for far too long in our area.\n\"Thank you to all those who supported me. To those who did not support me, I will always listen to you. I will be an MP for all of Chesham and Amersham, regardless of who you are and how you vote. \"\nUnsuccessful Tory candidate Peter Fleet had a somewhat different take on the situation - which you can read here.\nAcross the world people are starting to dance again.\nIn Berlin, nightclubs reopened on Friday allowing groups of up to 250 to throw shapes again on outdoor dance floors across the German capital.

We have to act quickly to try to make sure we are doing everything possible to suppress the spread of the virus, and that is what members of the public would expect of us.\"\nScotland's deputy first minister has defended the decision to implement a last-minute travel ban on people from Manchester, following condemnation from local mayor Andy Burnham.\nJohn Swinney told the Today programme: \"We have got to take decisions based on the data and the evidence that presents itself, and take decisions which are designed to stop the spread of the virus.\n\"In our judgment, the rising case numbers and the high levels of the virus in the Greater Manchester and Salford area justified the decision we took and we are taking that to try and minimise the circulation of the virus.\"\nHe added: \"That is something we will reflect on but we put in place very similar provisions in relation to Bolton, which is part of the Greater Manchester area, back in May, and we've just followed exactly the same approach in relation to this decision.\"\nThe Business Secretary has defended plans to spend \u00a3200m on a new royal yacht, despite it reportedly being widely panned.\nYesterday the Sunday Times reported that the project has turned into a hot potato, being kicked around departments including the Treasury, Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence.\nBut Kwasi Kwarteng stressed it was \"a good idea.\"\nHe told Sky News: \"It represents Britain- if we are going on trade missions that is exactly the way we would drive trade. You get more bang for our buck for something like that than the opposite.\"\nHe added: \"It\u2019s a huge amount of money, but the decision to spend that money would only be made if we felt we could get a return from something as symbolic like that, that enhanced our soft power.\"\nMPs will debate the Government's plans to overhaul planning today - but despite tensions still being high after the Tories' Chesham and Amersham defeat last week, a rebellion is not expected.\nLabour has an opposition day debate and vote this evening, challenging Tory MPs to kill the reforms.

It could be before but I think that is unlikely.

All rights reserved\nFirst Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\nLianne Sheppard was sitting in her office on a Friday afternoon when a colleague approached her with an old study on the safety of chlorpyrifos. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Environmental Protection Agency had used the study to set a safety level for the exposure to the pesticide, which is widely used on fruits and vegetables. But when Sheppard, a professor and biostatistician at the University of Washington, looked at the original research that was the basis for the paper and the safety thresholds that were calculated from it, she realized that the underlying data didn\u2019t support its conclusion.\n\u201cI tried to reproduce their analysis, and I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Sheppard said of the study, which was commissioned by Dow Chemical, the maker of chlorpyrifos, in the late 1960s. The research was conducted by an Albany Medical College professor named Frederick Coulston, who exposed 16 incarcerated men to the pesticide, dividing them into four groups \u2014 a low-, medium-, and high-dose group as well as a control \u2014 and recording their nervous system responses. The resulting paper, which was written by Dow statisticians based on Coulston\u2019s data, concluded that at the highest dose the pesticide depressed the activity of cholinesterase, an enzyme necessary for neuromuscular function. Sheppard was able to confirm that finding. But while Dow concluded that the middle- and low-range doses had no effect, Sheppard found effects in both groups. She also saw how Dow had used the paper to help the EPA set an incorrect \u201cno-effects level,\u201d or NOEL, which is critical for calculating a safety threshold.\n\u201cI realized that in the middle-dose group, which is the one that mattered for the no-effects level, they had conveniently left out one of the two baseline measurement days,\u201d said Sheppard. \u201cThe outrageous thing was that the group they declared as NOEL was only that because they left out data from their analysis.\u201d In a peer-reviewed paper published in October 2020, Sheppard and her colleagues concluded that \u201cthe omission of valid data without justification was a form of data falsification.\u201d\nBut by the time Sheppard had discovered the falsification, it was too late; the injustice of Dow\u2019s experiment had already extended far beyond violating the human rights of incarcerated people. Coulston\u2019s study was used for decades to set safety levels for chlorpyrifos that were higher than they otherwise would have been. Asked about the study, EPA spokesperson Kenneth Labbe responded in an email that the Coulston paper was not used in the most recent human health assessment of chlorpyrifos. But Sheppard pointed out that the research has been influential even after the EPA officially withdrew the study from consideration for ethical reasons in 2009 and noted that it continues to underly certain assumptions in chlorpyrifos regulation to this day.\nWhy didn\u2019t the agency catch Dow\u2019s falsification? \u201cEPA didn\u2019t scrutinize it at the level I did,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThe science is hard. And once a study has been around, who goes back and looks after it\u2019s been accepted for 10, 15, or 20 years?\u201d\nIn an email,\u00a0Kacey Birchmier, media relations manager for Corteva Agroscience, which now owns Dow, wrote that the company disagrees with the analysis and conclusions of Sheppard\u2019s paper. \u201cWhen used according to the label, chlorpyrifos is safe for all approved uses, as demonstrated by the more than 4,000 studies and reports examining the product in terms of health, safety and the environment,\u201d Birchmier wrote.\nOn one level, the story of the Coultson paper is simple: Decades ago, a seemingly small omission happened to slip past regulators. And yet the consequences of that one statistical sleight of hand, and the government\u2019s failure to notice it, are immense. Between 1992\u00a0and 2017, chlorpyrifos was one of the most heavily used pesticides in the U.S., with some 450 million pounds of it sprayed on crops. Countless children and pregnant\u00a0people were exposed to what we now know were unsafe levels. And those exposures have since been found to increase the risk of a wide range of neurodevelopmental problems in children, including ADHD and other attention disorders, autism, tremors, and intelligence deficits, as well as memory and motor problems. Although the true toll of that brain damage is incalculable, pediatrician and environmental health researcher Leonardo Trasande estimates that exposure to organophosphate pesticides, the class to which chlorpyrifos belongs, caused children born in the U.S. in a single year \u2014 2010 \u2014 to collectively lose 1.8 million IQ points, costing the country $44.7 billion in productivity, education, and health costs.\nThe Coulston study is just one of many instances in which an industry that is far more powerful and better resourced than the federal agency responsible for regulating it has hoodwinked, bullied, and persuaded the EPA into using inaccurate science at the expense of public health. And that influence over the research used to\u00a0set\u00a0the safe levels of pesticide exposure is just one of many tools that agrochemical companies like Dow have successfully wielded to increase and maintain the use of products even when they damage health and the environment.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency building is seen in Washington, D.C., on April 27, 2021.\nInterviews with more than two dozen experts on pesticide regulation \u2014\u00a0including 14 who worked at the EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs, or OPP \u2014 described a federal environmental agency that is often unable to stand up to the intense pressures from powerful agrochemical companies, which spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying each year and employ many former EPA scientists once they leave the agency. The enormous corporate influence has weakened and, in some cases, shut down the meaningful regulation of pesticides in the U.S. and left the country\u2019s residents exposed to levels of dangerous chemicals not tolerated in many other nations.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to catalog all the ways in which the EPA has failed to protect the public from the harms of pesticides, this reporting has brought to light several instances in which the overlooking, burying, or scuttling of science has had direct consequences for human health. The alarming discoveries include an EPA report warning about the link between the pesticide glyphosate and cancer that never saw the light of day; the failure to consider evidence that\u00a0a neonicotinoid pesticide causes brain damage; the refusal to investigate\u00a0evidence that another pesticide that is an ingredient in Roundup may cause cancer; the dismissal of science showing that the widely used pesticide malathion causes cancer; and the agency\u2019s waiving of the vast majority of toxicity tests at the request of industry.\nThe scientists who have identified these hazards described immense pressure from within the agency to overlook the risks they found. And several said they faced retribution for calling attention to the dangers of pesticides. \u201cIf you bring something up that\u2019s an inconvenient truth, you get circumvented for any kind of committee work that you would need to have to get a promotion,\u201d one toxicologist who used to work for the agency\u2019s\u00a0pesticide office told The Intercept. \u201cIt is the unwritten rule that to get promotions, all pesticides need to pass.\u201d\nSometimes\u00a0the urgency to approve pesticides comes from members of Congress,\u00a0according to one EPA scientist. Within the pesticide office, staff refer to such\u00a0cases as\u00a0\u201cyes packages,\u201d said the scientist,\u00a0who encountered the term on several occasions\u00a0in which elected officials reached out to the EPA on behalf of companies\u00a0whose pesticides were under review. \u201cThe companies will contact their local congressman or senator, and then we get what we call a congressional inquiry where\u00a0they\u2019ll contact our office directly and say, \u2018Why is this taking so long?'\u201d\nIn\u00a0these cases, the scientist said, managers in the office sometimes urge assessors to approve the pesticide quickly even if they don\u2019t have enough information to ensure their safety. \u201cThe science isn\u2019t there, they\u2019re missing some studies that we\u2019re requiring, but management will kind of like throw their hands and say, \u2018No, it\u2019s fine. Just make it fit in the guidelines,\u2019\u201d the scientist said, going on to describe the\u00a0first time they encountered the term.\u00a0\u201cI said, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 And then we had an internal meeting in which they explained, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a yes package.\u2019\u201d\nThe scientist described one particular internal meeting in 2015 over a \u201cyes package\u201d \u2014 the approval of a pesticide to treat the papaya ringspot virus, which was decimating the papaya crop in Hawaii.\u00a0Even though the company hadn\u2019t conducted any studies\u00a0of its safety, managers insisted that the scientists sign off on a decision to approve it. \u201cThe rest of us are sitting around thinking, \u2018OK, you hire the scientists to do the work, and now you\u2019re telling us as regulatory people to make it fit?\u2019\u201d the scientist recalled. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re flat out telling you that\u2019s not OK.\u2019\u201d Although the company never submitted data, the pesticide was approved.\nPresented with some of the\u00a0reporting\u00a0in this article, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., expressed dismay. \u201cThese findings are profoundly alarming and point to a troubling pattern of disregard at the EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs,\u201d Blumenthal wrote in an email to The Intercept.\u00a0\u201cIt is utterly unacceptable that scientists\u2019 concerns about potentially dangerous pesticides would be dismissed, and that scientists and whistleblowers would face retaliation. The pesticide industry has brazenly exploited loopholes in federal law for years and strong safeguards are needed to protect the public and our environment from harmful and sometimes lethal pesticide exposure. I will be pushing for these safeguards, continuing my call to ban toxic pesticides like chlorpyrifos, and working to ensure that the EPA\u2019s mission to protect the public from the risks of pesticides is fulfilled.\u201d\nIn response to questions about this article,\u00a0EPA spokesperson Kenneth Labbe wrote in an email, \u201cThe agency is committed to ensuring our pesticide registration decisions are free from interference and that the agency\u2019s scientific integrity policy, which is a bedrock principle for the Biden-Harris Administration, is upheld. EPA is home to world-class scientists. As it has in the past, the agency will continue to ensure their voices and the role of science will guide its decisions going forward. EPA\u00a0relies on the best science available and\u00a0evaluates\u00a0information from\u00a0multiple sources \u2014 pesticide companies, other governments, academia, and the published scientific literature \u2014 in its science evaluation process. Under Administrator Regan\u2019s leadership, EPA has a renewed commitment to protecting human health and the environment by making evidence-based decisions that rely on the input of career scientists.\u201d\nLabbe also offered reassurance about the agency\u2019s actions on chlorpyrifos. \u201cShould robust scientific data demonstrate that EPA-registered uses of chlorpyrifos are posing risks of concern to the environment or human health, the agency will take appropriate action,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEPA\u2019s decisions for chlorpyrifos will be a transparent process driven by science and the rule of law, ensuring concerns raised regarding farmworker and children\u2019s safety will be fully addressed.\u201d\nA truck\u00a0sprays DDT at Jones Beach, in New York, to eliminate mosquitoes in 1945.\nThe EPA was established in 1970 in large part because of concerns about pesticides and in small part because of a retired banker and bird enthusiast named Charles Broley. Broley tracked hundreds of bald eagles in Florida in the 1940s, banding the young birds in their nests before they flew northward. In 1947, he began to notice a steep decline in bald eagle numbers, as Rachel Carson recounted in her classic book \u201cSilent Spring.\u201d Between 1952 and 1957, when the pesticide DDT was sprayed to kill mosquitos in the waterways where the eagles fed, about 80 percent of their nests failed to produce any young, according to his tally.\nBroley died two years after that count \u2014 too soon to see the role his careful study would play in the future of environmental protection. But there\u2019s little question that his observation and Carson\u2019s artful description of the toll of DDT and other pesticides on the eagles, finches, hedge sparrows, linnets, red-winged blackbirds, and \u201cthe fulvous tree duck, a tawny-colored, gooselike duck of the Gulf Coast\u201d forever changed the public\u2019s view of pesticides. She made it irrefutably clear that chemicals that had been sold as a solution to insects and other \u201cpests\u201d were also killing many other species, including the bird that served as the national symbol of the United States.\nAs a freelance writer and employee of the Bureau of Fisheries, Carson had previously focused on the wonders of the sea. But \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d published in 1962, was shot through with outrage at the pesticide companies that were blithely devastating the natural world. She noted a grim pattern: After one toxic pesticide was targeted because of health concerns, it was often replaced by another pesticide that caused similar problems. DDT itself was introduced as a replacement for the pesticide lead arsenate, which was abandoned because it left lead residue on fruit. Carson clearly recognized the folly of presenting organic phosphorus compounds \u2014 the class that contains chlorpyrifos, which we now recognize as organophosphates \u2014 as a safe solution to DDT, since these replacements harmed the nervous systems of all creatures, including birds.\n\u201cWho has decided \u2014 who has the right to decide \u2014 for the countless legions of people who were not consulted that the supreme value is a world without insects, even though it be also a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in flight?\u201d she asked. Two years later, Carson herself died of cancer \u2014 too soon for her to know how much her book helped bring about a bipartisan consensus that the public, through government, has the right to protect nature and restrict the use of dangerous pesticides that were harming it.\nPesticide companies attacked Carson and her work. Monsanto magazine published a nasty\u00a0takedown\u00a0of \u201cSilent Spring\u201d that both parodied the book and painted a future\u00a0without pesticides, in which insects take over the Earth. Others questioned her sanity. But Carson\u2019s warnings won the day:\u00a0Eight years after the publication of \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d President Richard Nixon launched the EPA, using military language to describe its mission\u00a0\u2014 to fight a \u201cwar on pollution.\u201d William Ruckelshaus, the lawyer he appointed as the EPA\u2019s first administrator, seemed similarly resolved, vowing that the new agency would have \u201cno obligation to promote commerce or agriculture.\u201d That pointed remark was no doubt a reference to the agricultural lobby that had been intimately involved in the handling of pesticides up to that point, which had been overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1972, that responsibility was officially transferred to the EPA in the hopes of lessening the influence of farmers and pesticide makers over the regulatory process.\nThe young agency got off to a promising start in standing up to corporate influence. In its first decade, the EPA canceled the registration of 12 pesticides, including DDT, aldrin, and dieldrin, which Carson had written about at length. In those early years, the regulatory agency had the power to inspire fear in chemical companies, as was clear from internal documents about the pesticide paraquat. News that the EPA was considering banning the pesticide because there was no known antidote to paraquat poisoning sent executives at Imperial Chemical Industries, which made it, scurrying in search of some evidence of its safety.\nBut the pace at which the EPA removed pesticides from the market soon slowed. In the 1980s, the EPA canceled the registrations of eight pesticides. In the more than five decades since its founding, the agency has canceled only 37 pesticides. (The EPA said that it has canceled 40 \u201cpesticide products.\u201d) Between 2000 and 2010, the EPA forced a mere four pesticides off the market, and in the past decade, only one. Meanwhile, agrochemical companies have introduced thousands of pesticides. The EPA now\u00a0manages\u00a0more than 16,800 pesticide products and 1,200 active ingredients.\nAs the number of pesticides in use was exploding, knowledge of their harms was also increasing, with pesticides being linked to a wide range of human health harms. Beyond the brain damage in children wrought by chlorpyrifos, the chemicals have been linked to various cancers, such as leukemia, brain cancer, breast cancer, and testicular cancer; liver, kidney, and lung damage; reproductive harms, including decreased fertility, spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, birth defects, premature birth, and low birth weight; deaths by poisoning; Parkinson\u2019s disease; Alzheimer\u2019s disease; kidney disease; heart disease; autoimmune conditions; and respiratory problems.\nLeft/Top: A trispot darter. Right/Bottom: A rusty patched bumble bee.Photos: Dick Biggins/USFWS, Kim Mitchell/USFWS\nWe understand more, too, about how the chemicals are leading to the declines of species they\u2019re not supposed to affect. Pesticides are listed as an issue to be addressed in the recovery plan of 186 endangered species, including the trispot darter, the black warrior waterdog, the Texas hornshell, and the rusty patched bumble bee, whose drastic population decline has been tied partially to the use of neonicotinoid pesticides. The \u201cneonics,\u201d a class chemically related to nicotine, slow the learning process in bees and impact their ability to forage and fly long distances. Exposed to the same pesticides, songbirds lose weight and migrate later, which lessens their chances of reproducing, and deer have malformed jaws and reduced lifespans.\nFor those bald eagles that Broley was tracking in Florida, and for other bird species, too, we now know that DDT was weakening their eggshells, which meant that some birds that were sitting on the eggs to warm them wound up crushing their young instead. Some pesticides cause fish to abandon their nests and broods; others lower resistance to disease and reduce avoidance of predators. And, not surprisingly, many of the chemicals designed to kill bugs, weeds, fungi, and other \u201cpests\u201d harm both humans and other animal species.\nThe growing evidence of the dangers of these compounds has led the governments of other major agricultural economies to remove some of the chemicals from use. The U.S., once the beacon of hope for pesticide regulation, now lags behind. In 2016, the U.S. used 322 million pounds of pesticides that were banned elsewhere, according to a 2019 study by Nathan Donley, a biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. Donley said that most of these chemicals had been banned for health and environmental reasons. At least 85 pesticides banned in China, Brazil, or the European Union were still used in the U.S. in 2016, he said, a number that has almost certainly increased since then.\nBottles of Roundup are seen for sale on June 19, 2018, at a retail store in Glendale, Calif.\nSome of pesticide companies\u2019 success in the U.S. can be attributed to their extraordinarily aggressive approach to dealing with regulators. Monsanto, maker of Roundup and other products that contain the weed killer glyphosate, summed up the company\u2019s commitment to pushing past regulatory limits with the phrase \u201cfreedom to operate.\u201d As internal documents released through litigation made clear, Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer in 2018, saw its \u201cfreedom to operate\u201d as encompassing ghostwriting purportedly independent scientific papers, cozying up to regulators, and attempting to discredit journalists who exposed the dangers of Monsanto\u2019s products.\nAsked about the \u201cfreedom to operate,\u201d Kyel Richard, a senior external communications manager for Bayer U.S. Crop Science, responded in an email, \u201cLike many companies and organizations operating in highly regulated industries, we provide information and contribute to science-based policymaking and regulatory processes. Our engagements with all those in the public sector are routine, professional, and consistent with all laws and regulations.\u201d\nBut Monsanto wasn\u2019t alone in encouraging employees to aggressively push against regulatory barriers, according to Charles Benbrook, a veteran agricultural economist who has spent years poring over internal documents on pesticides as an expert witness in the litigation with Monsanto and Bayer over Roundup, as well as in two cases against Dow and Corteva over chlorpyrifos. Benbrook is also scheduled to be an expert witness in litigation over the herbicide paraquat, made by Syngenta.\n\u201cThe regulatory affairs staff of all of these major chemical companies have a very clear job: to propose and gain approval of registrations that expand the ways and places and times that the company\u2019s products can be used and to keep all existing registrations fully in place and resist any changes in labels \u2014 whether it be application rate, or a limit on timing, or a warning on the label about some health hazard \u2014 that might cost them a percent or two in market share,\u201d said Benbrook. \u201cThe regulatory affairs departments of these companies actually compete against each other and sometimes brag that they were able to keep one of their high-risk pesticides on the market longer than some other company that threw in the towel prematurely.\u201d\nBenbrook described tireless corporate campaigns to portray pesticides as harmless even as independent research showed otherwise. \u201cThe companies constantly regurgitate their own spin on the science. And they refer to papers that they get into the journals that have been either commissioned or partially or wholly ghostwritten,\u201d said Benbrook. For glyphosate, which has been under scrutiny for its cancer-causing potential at the EPA since at least 1983, the goal wasn\u2019t just to discredit any scientific evidence that the chemical posed harm, but also to get \u201cpeople to get up and shout Glyphosate is Non-toxic,\u201d as one 1999 email made clear.\nOne of the ways that agrochemical companies convince EPA scientists to get up and shout about their products \u2014 or more subtly gain their sympathies \u2014 is by inviting them to visit farms. EPA scientists traveled to a tour of a New Jersey farm by bus, and once there, they were served a simple supper of barbecue and corn on paper plates. \u201cIt felt fancy in comparison to what we\u2019re accustomed to in government,\u201d said one former staff scientist in the pesticide office, who attended the junket and found it surprisingly affecting.\n\u201cIt was subtle, but it did change the way I think,\u201d said the scientist, who asked not to be named to avoid professional reprisals. It wasn\u2019t just chatting with a corporate scientist who was seeking approval of the very pesticide the EPA staffer was then reviewing while the two waited in the buffet line or hearing farmers talk about the economic threats posed by weeds. It was the cumulative effect of spending time with these people outside the office.\n\u201cIt felt kind of brain-washy,\u201d they said. \u201cBy the end, I thought, \u2018You really do need these chemicals, otherwise you\u2019ll have crop failure.\u2019\u201d\nWhile costing the companies and trade groups just a few hundred dollars per participant, such tours, which OPP staff can attend on work time, are clearly valuable to the agrochemical industry. Among the organizations that hosted recent junkets are the Weed Science Society of America, which sponsors a crop tour in Kansas featuring a session on 2,4-D and dicamba tolerant crop technologies, and the National Potato Council, which advocates for the use of various pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, and holds a summer tour in Idaho that features a side trip to Yellowstone Bear World. The Fertilizer Institute, the National Agricultural Aviation Association, and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers also sponsor events and trips for EPA scientists. And agency staff attended an event at Chesapeake Farms in Maryland;\u00a0two of the farmers on the \u201cAsk a Farmer\u201d panel at that event also work for Pioneer, a seed company, which makes pesticides that are registered by the agency.\nWhen asked if there is a limit to the amount that sponsoring companies can spend on farm tours or on how much work time EPA staff can spend on them, Labbe wrote that \u201cEPA abides by all ethics statutes and maintains a culture of the highest ethical conduct with the amount of money sponsoring groups can spend on activities that EPA staff attend. Staff participation in crop tours have provided an increase in awareness and more educated discussions on the subject at hand such as farmworker issues.\u201d\nThe pesticide industry also has an outsize presence within the agency. The representatives of the companies are usually, though not always, friendly and eager to help, according to several scientists who have worked at the agency\u2019s pesticide office.\n\u201cWhen you come into the lobby, many times there\u2019s a chemical or ag lobbyist there. They just bop in,\u201d said Karen McCormack, a scientist who retired from the EPA in 2017 after working on pesticides for 40 years. \u201cThey want to be your friend. They always compliment you. But if you don\u2019t do what they want, they\u2019ll go to your boss or above your boss and say, \u2018We can\u2019t work with you anymore.\u2019 And you\u2019ll be taken off the project and put on something that\u2019s meaningless. I\u2019ve seen it happen a number of times.\u201d\nA Miami-Dade County mosquito control inspector\u00a0sprays pesticide to kill mosquitos on Aug. 24, 2016, in Miami Beach, Fla.\nThat was the experience of one former\u00a0pesticide assessor\u00a0who expressed concern about the\u00a0dangers presented by a pesticide product that contained the chemical bifenthrin, which was submitted to the agency for approval by Vive Crop Protection. An insecticide used to kill ants and mosquitoes in more than 600 products in the U.S., bifenthrin caused \u201ca significantly higher incidence\u201d of lung cancers, as well as liver and bladder tumors, when it was given to lab animals orally, according to the assessor. This finding, along with the fact that it is a pyrethroid, a class of pesticides that are more toxic when inhaled as opposed to ingested \u2014 some as much as 100 times more so \u2014\u00a0should have led to\u00a0extensive inhalation toxicity testing when it came before the pesticide program\u2019s Hazard and Science Policy Committee in 2012, the scientist said.\nBut the EPA\u00a0waived the requirement for extensive inhalation toxicity testing of bifenthrin. The EPA\u2019s Labbe acknowledged that staffers waived the requirement for a longer study but said that the agency reviewed and incorporated\u00a0a\u00a028-day study supplied by the chemical\u2019s manufacturer into the human health risk assessment for bifenthrin. According to the assessor,\u00a0the industry\u00a0study was not nearly long enough to assess lung cancer formation.\u00a0\u201cYou need a study of at least a year and a half,\u201d they said. \u201cOften, in cancer studies, the first tumors show up after 12 months.\u201d Labbe also said that evidence that bifenthrin causes cancer was reviewed \u2014 and dismissed. \u201cThe Cancer Peer Review Committee (CPRC) did note a higher incidence of lung tumors in female mice in some dose groups in the oral carcinogenicity study; however, there was no significant dose-related trend for these tumors,\u201d Labbe wrote.\nAn invitation to a party at the Office of Pesticide Programs celebrating the waiving of 1,000 toxicity tests.\nIn any case, bifenthrin was not the only pesticide that dodged testing to see if it\u00a0presented\u00a0dangers. The EPA\u2019s pesticide office granted 972 industry requests to waive toxicity tests between December 2011 and May 2018,\u00a089 percent of all requests made.\u00a0Among the tests on pesticides that were never performed were\u00a090 percent of tests looking for developmental neurotoxicity, 92 percent of chronic cancer studies, and 97 percent of studies looking at how pesticides harm the immune system.\nBy law, the companies that submit their products for review pay for these tests, and in a presentation about the waivers last year, Anna Lowit, a senior science adviser in the office, emphasized the savings to these\u00a0companies: more than $300 million. Lowit also noted that animal lives\u00a0were saved \u2014 a goal that the Trump administration and the chemical industry prioritized\u00a0within the agency.\u00a0The EPA\u00a0developed the guidelines for waiving the tests along with BASF, Corteva, and Syngenta, pesticide manufacturers that all stand to benefit significantly from having\u00a0their products\u00a0bypass toxicity testing.\nThere is no\u00a0replacement for these waived experiments, according to pediatrician and epidemiologist Philip Landrigan. \u201cThere is no other way\u00a0to know if a chemical is toxic but to test it,\u201d said Landrigan, who co-authored a landmark\u00a0report on children\u2019s particular vulnerability to pesticides. \u201cIf they allow chemicals to come onto the market and to be used widely in the environment and put on food crops without testing them for toxicity, then\u00a0EPA is clearly not fulfilling\u00a0its mandate to protect human health.\u201d\nAlthough the toxicity studies were designed to protect health, a core part of the agency\u2019s mission, the leadership of the office of pesticides appeared pleased to have\u00a0waived them.\u00a0On September 20, 2018, managers in the office gathered in one of the agency\u2019s\u00a0conference rooms to celebrate what many people concerned about\u00a0exposure to\u00a0pesticides\u00a0would consider a grim landmark: having waived 1,000 toxicity tests. \u201cThere will be cake,\u201d an emailed invitation promised.\nAfter\u00a0trying, and failing, to protect\u00a0human health\u00a0by\u00a0calling attention to the\u00a0tumors caused by\u00a0bifenthrin, the EPA pesticide assessor had several requests to be appointed to relevant committees denied, a development\u00a0they felt was retaliation for raising concerns about the pesticide. Several other EPA scientists who worked on pesticides spoke of being passed over for positions on committees, which are necessary for professional advancement, after they attempted to call attention to evidence of hazards presented by the chemicals.\nTim Whitehouse, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an organization that represents whistleblowers at public agencies on issues of environmental ethics and scientific integrity, said that the group has recently received\u00a0several similar reports from people working within the EPA\u2019s pesticide division.\u00a0\u201cCurrent and former employees have been reaching out to us in increasing numbers and expressing concerns about the office culture at OPP and the fact that if scientists speak out about their concerns, they will not last long in that division,\u201d said Whitehouse, who described the working conditions in the division of the EPA as very difficult. \u201cMorale has been bad, and it\u2019s getting steadily worse over the years.\u201d\nWhile the agency scientist felt\u00a0that their career suffered, others saw theirs advance. Jim Jones was head of the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which includes the pesticide office, when concerns about the pyrethroids were raised \u2014 and their toxicity tests waived.\u00a0He went on to join the board of directors of Vive Crop Protection, the company that made the bifenthrin-containing product,\u00a0after leaving the agency in 2017.\nJones also became an executive vice president at the Household and Commercial Products Association in 2017. In the organization\u2019s annual report, Jones is quoted as saying that \u201cone of the strengths of HCPA is its strong and mutually respectful relationship with the EPA that continues to give members direct access to officials at every pertinent level of the agency.\u201d\nJones, who is no longer affiliated with either company, said he never spoke with anyone at the EPA about bifenthrin after leaving the agency. In 2020, he started his own consulting company, which represents a range of clients, including private companies, environmental groups, and trade associations.\nWilliam Ruckelshaus\u00a0is sworn\u00a0in as the first administrator of the\u00a0EPA on Dec. 4, 1970.\nPhoto: U.S. Government\nJones is far from the only high-ranking EPA official who went from regulating pesticides to doing work for the companies that make them. The tradition of leaving the agency for a lucrative job in the industry overseen by it began with\u00a0Ruckelshaus, the EPA\u2019s very first administrator. Widely admired and hailed for his commitment to the environment, Ruckelshaus left the EPA in 1973 (in Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d) to work for the timber and paper company Weyerhauser and was later hired by the American Paper Institute, Monsanto, and the waste management company Browning-Ferris Industries.\nThe path from the EPA\u2019s pesticide office to working in the pesticide industry is particularly well trodden. Since 1974, all seven of the office\u2019s directors who continued to work after leaving the agency went on to make money from the pesticide companies they used to regulate, according to an analysis by The Intercept. (The two other former directors who left the agency went directly into retirement.) Most, like Jones, used their intimate knowledge of the regulatory process to\u00a0help companies navigate\u00a0it. Former Directors Marcia Mulkey, Dan Barolo, and Steve Schatzow went on to work as attorneys for the industry. In addition to consulting for industry, former Director Steve Bradbury is now a professor at Iowa State University, where his work is funded by Monsanto, Bayer, Syngenta, and the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, among others. And Debra Edwards, who served as director of pesticide programs from 2007 to 2010, later joined the board of the agrochemical company American Vanguard.\nMany other EPA officials have left the agency to work for the agrochemical industry. Stephen Johnson, who served as assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, as well as EPA administrator, later joined the board of Scotts Miracle-Gro, which markets the pesticide glyphosate in the U.S. Linda Fisher served as assistant EPA administrator before going on to work for Monsanto and DuPont. John Todhunter, an assistant EPA administrator in charge of pesticides, went on to become a pesticide consultant. Bill Jordan served as deputy director of the pesticide office until 2015 and is now a consultant to pesticide companies. Steven Jellineck, a former assistant administrator for toxic substances, founded a consulting firm that would eventually employ many other former employees of\u00a0the pesticide office and represented Monsanto, Dow, FMC, and the Chemical Manufacturers Association, among other agrochemical companies.\nThe problem with this continuous flow of experts from the government to pesticide companies \u2014 and sometimes back again \u2014 isn\u2019t just that it can enable dangerous chemicals to evade regulatory scrutiny but that it also shapes the culture within the agency. \u201cManagement officials graduate and move to direct hires with the registrants,\u201d said Bill Hirzy, a 27-year veteran of EPA. \u201cSo these management officials are loathe to take any action that is likely to limit their post-EPA employment opportunities.\u201d\nThe long, intertwined histories of\u00a0chemical companies and the EPA\u2019s pesticide office help explain why the problems of regulation have persisted\u00a0through\u00a0the changes in\u00a0presidential administrations \u2014 and continue even as the Biden administration vows to\u00a0address\u00a0the EPA\u2019s scientific integrity problems.\n\u201cThe Office of Pesticide Programs\u00a0was about 20\u00a0percent worse under Trump, maybe 25,\u201d said Lori Ann Burd, who directs the environmental health program at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the 360 they did on climate change. They didn\u2019t need to change that much to meet the Trump administration\u2019s agenda.\u201d Burd said that she has noticed only\u00a0minor changes in the agency\u2019s approach to pesticides under President Joe Biden. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a slightly different tone.\u00a0But in our litigation, it\u2019s the same brass knuckles, fight to the death over everything.\u201d\nPart of the problem is that the main law that applies to pesticide oversight, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which originally passed in 1947, wasn\u2019t designed to protect health or the environment. \u201cFIFRA is encoded to approve pesticides,\u201d said Scott Faber, who leads the Environmental Working Group\u2019s government affairs efforts. \u201cThere have been many changes to try to bolt on provisions that ensure that pesticides don\u2019t pose an unreasonable risk to the environment. But the law is ultimately still designed to protect farmers and encourage pesticide companies to bring new products to the market.\u201d\nAccording to the federal statute, the EPA can only refuse to reregister a pesticide if the risks it poses to human health, wildlife, and the environment are greater than the benefits it provides, which are measured in terms of crop yield and quality. So even if a pesticide presents a clear danger, the agency often finds that the danger is outweighed by whatever economic advantages it offers.\n\u201cIf EPA finds risk, it will look at benefits to growers,\u201d said Patti Goldman, an attorney with Earthjustice. Goldman also said that the EPA finds ways to balance out almost any risk\u00a0it identifies in an effort to avoid pulling pesticides from the market. \u201cYou get to the end, and EPA says the company is willing to use a little less, or use it a little less often, or they\u2019ll put a little bit of a buffer around schools, or require some protective clothing, and then they\u2019ll just say we find the risk is less than the benefits,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cIt\u2019s unprincipled.\u201d\nThe law does require that pesticides not cause \u201cunreasonable adverse effects\u201d to the environment, but that vague endpoint is left to the interpretation of EPA officials, who are in frequent contact with representatives of the companies that make pesticides, who supply them with data and income in the form of registration fees.\nThis heavy reliance on the powerful industry it regulates leaves the EPA unable to objectively judge the chemicals\u2019 effects, according to Burd. \u201cThe bottom-line standard in FIFRA \u2014 having an unreasonable adverse effect \u2014 that\u2019s a judgment call. And who makes that judgment call? People who call the pesticide industry their \u2018client,\u2019\u201d said Burd. As a lawyer whose job involves surveying the impact of pesticides on both wildlife and humans, she feels that the EPA\u2019s pesticide office has consistently abused its legal leeway to weigh in on the side of the chemicals. \u201cAs far as this office goes, extinction is not unreasonable, mass poisonings are not unreasonable, and pollinator population collapses are not unreasonable.\u201d\nAlthough the law does require data as part of applications to register or reregister pesticides, companies are allowed to supply their own data, and the government often does not have the resources to verify the submissions. The EPA is supposed to review the studies pesticide manufacturers supply, but from the beginning it has struggled to keep up with the volume of the corporate science. When the EPA took over the regulation of pesticides, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent tens of thousands of studies over in boxes.\n\u201cThere were piles and piles of them,\u201d said McCormack, who joined an overwhelmed staff when she arrived to work in the pesticide office in 1976. The EPA had recently received the safety data for more than 30,000 pesticide products. \u201cBoxes were everywhere. Some of the studies were missing, some were illegible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a huge mess.\u201d\nIn part because of the data overload, Congress decided in 1978 to change the requirements so that companies would only have to test \u201cactive ingredients\u201d in pesticide products. All others would be considered \u201cinert\u201d and exempt from testing. From that point on, pesticide makers would also have the option of registering their products \u201cconditionally,\u201d which allows them to sell the chemicals without providing complete safety data to regulators. Since then, thousands of pesticides have entered the market through this loophole. According to the EPA\u2019s Labbe, the agency has taken steps to improve the accuracy of information and internal tracking of conditional registration decisions, as well as to promote consistency, enhance transparency, and improve understanding of decision-making under FIFRA.\nBut as new pesticides continued to enter the market, the EPA never caught up with industry. \u201cThe agency didn\u2019t have the capability with the resources and staffing that Congress gave them,\u201d said Colleen Lanier-Christensen, a\u00a0doctoral candidate at Harvard University who is studying the EPA. \u201cThe expectations were unrealistic. They didn\u2019t have sufficient expertise. There were technical problems.\u201d\nIn the early 1980s, Congress held hearings on the difficulties of regulating pesticides. One of the upshots was that the EPA was made to go through the registrations of every pesticide that had been approved before 1984. But the mandate didn\u2019t come with additional resources. In fact, the agency\u2019s budget shrank dramatically during that time. So while the pesticide office did eventually review the data and previous risk assessments for the pesticides that had been approved before 1984, it took more than 30 years, and since then, thousands more pesticides have been approved.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough resources to go through all the studies. And there isn\u2019t enough time,\u201d said McCormack. Because it doesn\u2019t have adequate staff to do the work itself, the pesticide office uses contractors to do an initial review of the science. \u201cWhat happens then is that people at EPA look at what the contractors said and decide whether to accept it or not,\u201d said McCormack. \u201cFor the most part, they just accept it.\u201d\nA \u201cdanger pesticides\u201d sign is seen next to rows of tomato plants on Oct. 22, 2015.\nEven when an agency scientist does catch a problem with the industry studies, it is sometimes impossible to correct it. That was the case for an EPA toxicologist who was asked in the summer of 2018 to review the toxicity of a pesticide called pelargonic acid. The toxicologist looked at the previous reviews of the chemical going back to 1997, which had found that it posed no health threat. In an effort to be thorough, the scientist decided to look up the archived raw data on which those reports were based and found that several mice had developed leukemia and lymphoma after the chemical was applied to their skin.\n\u201cThe reviews said there was no chronic toxicity, but when I looked at the actual study, it was clearly the opposite,\u201d the toxicologist told The Intercept. The next logical step, the federal scientist assumed, was to ask the Cancer Assessment Review Committee to reassess the chemical. And when the EPA staffer spoke to several colleagues and managers individually about the situation and showed them the study, each agreed without hesitation that there was cause for concern and that it should be reassessed by the cancer committee.\nBut a group of managers in the pesticide office did not agree and were especially resistant, the scientist believes, because of the role of pelargonic acid, which, in addition to being used as a weed killer on its own, is one of the \u201cco-formulants\u201d in Roundup.\n\u201cWhen I finally mentioned the connection with glyphosate, all of a sudden everyone pulled back,\u201d the toxicologist said.\nThe toxicologist feared that because there was data showing that both pelargonic acid and glyphosate could independently cause leukemias and lymphomas, together the compound could be particularly dangerous. They also feared that pelargonic acid might act as a \u201cco-carcinogen\u201d by facilitating the absorption of glyphosate into the skin of people who were exposed to it. A review by the cancer committee could help explain the years of research showing that weed killers that contain glyphosate are more likely to cause cell-cycle dysregulation, a hallmark of cancer, than glyphosate alone.\nBut the scientist said that managers in the pesticide office discouraged a reassessment of pelargonic acid from the cancer committee and made the process of requesting it difficult. After raising the concerns, the scientist reported facing increased scrutiny from their supervisor, being repeatedly threatened with disciplinary action, and being written up for failing to meet a deadline that was moved without their knowledge. The scientist subsequently left the division. Meanwhile, pelargonic acid has still not been presented to the cancer review committee and remains in use both as a stand-alone pesticide and an ingredient in Roundup.\nAsked about pelargonic acid, the EPA\u2019s Labbe responded that \u201cEPA has concluded that there is no new information that would require pelargonic acid to be reassessed by the Cancer Assessment Review Committee.\u201d\nPresented with the account of the EPA toxicologist\u2019s account of pelargonic acid, Bayer spokesperson Kyel Richard wrote, \u201cAll formulations of our Roundup brand herbicides have been comprehensively evaluated and approved by experts at regulatory authorities to ensure the products can be used safely according to the label instructions. As consumers ourselves, we welcome the independent and science-based regulatory processes in place that ensure the safe and effective use of our products.\u201d\nThe glyphosate connection put the chemical, and the toxicologist, near the center of a controversy that has already brought unwelcome attention to the agency\u2019s handling of pesticides. Due to documents released in litigation over whether Roundup and other glyphosate-containing weed killers cause cancer, the public has learned the role that EPA staff played in slowing an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry study of the compound; that the agency had based its regulatory decisions about the herbicide almost exclusively on the manufacturer\u2019s own science; and that the office had mysteriously switched glyphosate\u2019s cancer classification in 1991 from having \u201csuggestive evidence\u201d of carcinogenic potential to its current status of having \u201cno evidence\u201d of carcinogenic potential.\nYet there is even more evidence that has not previously come to light that some at the EPA have been covering up science showing the cancer-causing potential of glyphosate. In the summer of 2016, the EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development produced an analysis of seven epidemiological studies that looked at the association between non-Hodgkin lymphoma and glyphosate, which was then the most widely used pesticide in the U.S. The internal report, which was marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d found that the four highest-quality studies \u201call reported elevated risks of NHL associated with exposure to glyphosate even after controlling for other pesticide exposures\u201d and concluded that the studies \u201cprovide suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential between glyphosate exposure and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u201d\nBut the EPA never published this clear expression of concern. Instead, it subsequently released reports in 2016 and 2017 that clearly drew on the earlier document \u2014 several sections have identical wording \u2014 but reached the opposite conclusion: that glyphosate is \u201cnot a probable carcinogen.\u201d The agency also declared that glyphosate is not a probable carcinogen in 2019 and again in 2020, when it reregistered the pesticide for another 15 years. Although its own scientists had found a link between glyphosate and cancer in studies of human populations in 2016 (and the World Health Organization had acknowledged the cancer link a year earlier), the EPA continues to allow the use of the pesticide with the assurance that there is \u201cinsufficient evidence to conclude that glyphosate plays a role in any human diseases\u201d and that \u201cthere are no risks of concern to human health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label.\u201d\nAccording to the EPA\u2019s Labbe, the unpublished report was used internally by staff scientists to discuss epidemiological studies before the completion of a paper that was presented to the agency\u2019s external FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel. \u201cSeveral iterations of text were prepared by different staff members during the process of drafting the Issue Paper to aid in discussions and the exchange of scientific opinions. As such, the document does not reflect subsequent staff discussions and revisions,\u201d Labbe wrote.\u00a0Labbe also emphasized that the studies that were assessed in the report were taken into consideration in the agency\u2019s decision to classify glyphosate as \u201cnot likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\u201d\nThe cherry-picking of data from the buried report was particularly troubling to Genna Reed, a senior analyst at the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists who reviewed the report. \u201cThey only used the pieces of the meta-analysis that fit the conclusion they wanted to support,\u201d said Reed, who added that the suppression of the damning conclusion reached in the 2016 report was part of a pattern. \u201cThere is clearly a need for more firewalls to prevent political interference with the science.\u201d\nA worker sprays pesticide into a crevice in the base of a tree where a hive of bees have taken up residence.\nIn some other cases, concerns about the health hazards of pesticides do make it into the public record \u2014 and are still overlooked. This was the case for evidence that acetamiprid, one of the five neonic pesticides approved for use, harms the developing brain. Well known for devastating bees and other pollinators, there is also evidence linking neonics to brain damage in children, including autism-like symptoms, brain malformations, and memory problems. The EPA requires tests to screen for these problems. And the test of acetamiprid\u2019s developmental neurotoxicity showed that the chemical affects rats\u2019 developing brains, according to a 2007 memo written by an EPA statistician named James Nguyen.\nAccording to Nguyen\u2019s memo, Exponent, a company hired to analyze the data by the pesticide manufacturer Nippon Soda Company, misinterpreted the results of that testing, as did the EPA. Although some male rats exposed to a mid-level dose of the pesticide had an impaired startle reflex, which allows them to respond to sudden stimuli, Exponent had dismissed the effects. Nguyen characterized the company\u2019s analysis as \u201cthe incorrect reporting of results.\u201d\nAlthough Nguyen recognized the error, the EPA did not reduce the official level at which acetamiprid is considered to have no effects from the one set by the industry\u2019s interpretation of the data. Instead, without addressing the points he raised, the agency simply stapled Nguyen\u2019s memo into the larger file on acetamiprid.\nMeanwhile, there is other evidence that neonics can harm the developing brain, causing thinning in some areas and motor problems such as tremors and staggering, as well as delaying sexual development. Since there is neonic residue on foods that kids often eat (including 60 percent of nonorganic applesauce samples tested), there is reason to fear that the pesticide could now be causing brain damage in children.\nDespite the evidence, scientists from Exponent, as well as Bayer and Syngenta \u2014 all\u00a0companies that make neonics\u00a0\u2014 have concluded that the insecticides don\u2019t affect the developing brain. And the EPA seems to have largely agreed with their conclusion, having imposed only minimal restrictions on them and refusing to impose a \u201cchild safety factor,\u201d which would require setting a more conservative exposure level.\nWhile there are only a handful of studies looking at the neurotoxicity of neonics to humans \u2014 some of which show that high-level exposure to the pesticides can cause coma and convulsions \u2014 Landrigan, the pediatrician and epidemiologist, anticipates that there will soon be many more. \u201cWhen I started out as a pediatrician in the late 1960s, the only toxicity of lead that we recognized at that time was coma and convulsions,\u201d said Landrigan, whose work helped establish the now widely accepted fact that even low levels of lead damage children\u2019s brains.\n\u201cThat same progression took place in the case of mercury, and the same progression took place in the case of chlorpyrifos, and I suspect it will take place with neonicotinoids if they stay on the market \u2014 that we\u2019re going to find, with more and more study, more rigorous study designs, and more sensitive tests, that neonics are toxic to children, even down to very low levels,\u201d said Landrigan. \u201cEvery single neurotoxin has behaved that way.\u201d\nLandrigan sees the chemical industry\u2019s claims that neonics are a safe alternative to older pesticides such as chlorpyrifos as fitting into another broad pattern. \u201cThey\u2019ll stand behind a pesticide until they develop the next one, and then they\u2019ll suddenly say, \u2018Aha, we have a safer successor,\u2019\u201d said Landrigan. \u201cI suspect they have something else in the pipeline we haven\u2019t yet seen that they\u2019re working on as we speak and will roll it out when the neonics go down.\u201d\nThe cycle of replacements is taking its toll on wildlife too. While the EPA touts the comeback of bald eagles as a success story, the birds are now being poisoned, and sometimes killed,\u00a0by a new generation of rodenticides.\nIt\u2019s darkly ironic that neonics have been presented as a safe alternative to chlorpyrifos and the other organophosphates, whose use skyrocketed because they were considered safe alternatives to DDT, which was itself introduced as a replacement for another dangerous pesticide. With the exception of DDT, all these chemicals remain on the market. In 2015, Bayer registered a new neonic alternative, flupyradifurone, which the company has promoted as having a \u201cvery promising\u201d safety profile. Yet flupyradifurone, which was supposed to be \u201csafer,\u201d has already been found to\u00a0harm bees.\nSimilarly, the use of paraquat has increased as an alternative to glyphosate as concerns about its association with cancer, and weeds resistant to it, have grown,\u00a0even though exposure to paraquat has been associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease since the 1980s. Despite mounting evidence of their harms, both pesticides remain on the market, and their manufacturers continue to push for their continued registration. In 2003, Syngenta, the maker of paraquat, identified the science connecting the pesticide to Parkinson\u2019s as \u201ca threat to Syngenta\u2019s paraquat business objectives\u201d and laid out a plan \u201cto shift the focus of serious PD research to other environmental factors.\u201d The company insists that paraquat is safe and effective.\nThe ongoing use of so many problematic chemicals suggests that the EPA may have taken the wrong lesson from Carson\u2019s book, according to Lanier-Christensen, the historian studying the agency. \u201cThey took action on DDT. But if we look more broadly at the critique in \u2018Silent Spring,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t really about DDT,\u201d said Lanier-Christensen. \u201cIt was about a broader approach to using chemicals to replace other chemicals.\u201d\nYet another chemical, malathion, was once held up as a safer alternative to DDT. One of the most widely used pesticides in the same class as chlorpyrifos in the U.S., it is sprayed to kill mosquitos and control weeds in landscaping and agriculture. But the EPA has possessed, and dismissed, evidence that malathion is dangerous to people for decades.\nIn February 2000, a working group at the EPA classified malathion as \u201clikely to be carcinogenic to humans\u201d based on evidence that mice and rats exposed to it developed liver tumors. The designation would have required the agency to do a risk assessment that could have limited exposure to the chemical. But after it learned of the agency\u2019s proposed classification, Cheminova, one of the manufacturers of the pesticide, hired a company to reinterpret the evidence and convened another meeting to discuss the carcinogenicity of malathion. Brian Dementi, a senior EPA toxicologist who was an expert on malathion and led the working group that supported its classification as a likely human carcinogen, was not invited, or even told about, this second meeting, at which the scientists paid to defend malathion suggested downgrading its status to \u201csuggestive evidence of carcinogenicity,\u201d a classification that doesn\u2019t require a risk assessment.\nDementi wrote to Mike Leavitt and Stephen Johnson, then the EPA administrator and deputy administrator, respectively, laying out the evidence that malathion caused cancer and warning that if it was not classified as a likely human carcinogen, \u201cpublic health will be endangered.\u201d Dementi suggested that the pesticide \u201cshould be re-assessed by pathologists not in the employ of the registrant.\u201d In another letter, Dementi said he felt compelled to call attention to the evidence suggesting that malathion caused leukemia and dissent from the EPA\u2019s assessment of it. \u201cIn numerous places, for inexplicable reasons, this risk assessment sidesteps or down plays actual evidence of toxicity,\u201d Dementi wrote in 2005. \u201cMy justification in setting forth these dissenting opinions resides with my sense of duty, and in the hope the risk assessment will be suitable to protect public health.\u201d Later he wrote an additional letter to the EPA administrator, emphasizing that children were particularly susceptible to malathion.\nBill Hirzy, a scientist and an official in the union that represented Dementi, remembers the pressure to give malathion a pass as intense. \u201cWhen malathion was up for reregistration, when the heads of the various divisions who were looking at health effects were sitting around the table and planning to address the issue, the science adviser poked his head in the door and said, \u2018This is a big-ticket pesticide, and we don\u2019t want to have any problems,\u2019\u201d he said.\nDespite the concerns that Dementi raised, malathion was given the less-restrictive designation. Johnson, then the deputy administrator of the EPA, went on to become administrator of the agency and, in 2010, joined the board of Scotts Miracle-Gro, a company that sold malathion, among other pesticides. Since then, mounting evidence has linked the pesticide to numerous cancers, including thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. In 2015, the WHO concluded that malathion is \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans.\u201d And in 2017, the EPA itself found that 97 percent of federally protected species are likely harmed by it. Nevertheless, malathion remains classified as only having \u201csuggestive evidence of carcinogenicity.\u201d Each year, about\u00a01 million pounds of malathion are sprayed in the U.S.\nJohnson did not respond to several requests for comment for this article. In response to questions about malathion, an EPA spokesperson wrote, \u201cEPA\u00a0is following the next steps in the registration review process for malathion in accordance with President Biden\u2019s commitment to protect human health and the environment. Both the Proposed Interim Decision and Interim Decision for malathion are expected to be completed in 2022. EPA is currently working on a revised human health risk assessment, incorporating physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) data received earlier this year.\u201d\nDewayne Johnson looks on after hearing the verdict to his case against Monsanto in San Francisco on Aug. 10, 2018.\nIn the most basic sense, the companies that make and sell dangerous pesticides have succeeded in dodging regulators and keeping their products on the market. But if they have been able to waive, bury, and ignore the science that points to those dangers, pesticide manufacturers have not been able to outrun the harms that this science highlighted. By suppressing research used for regulation, the industry has found itself engaged in a much bigger, much more public experiment, the consequences of which are playing out on a global scale \u2014 and in the U.S. courts.\nAs the data Coulston collected more than 50 years ago predicted it would, chlorpyrifos exposure did cause brain damage. Although Dow has agreed to stop making the pesticide and an April federal court ruling will most likely force the EPA to finally revoke its registration, the lawsuits against Dow and Corteva over brain damage from chlorpyrifos are on the rise. Attorney Stuart Calwell has filed six separate suits against Dow and Corteva over chlorpyrifos. Among his clients are the parents of Rafael Cerda Calderon, who was exposed to chlorpyrifos in utero, when his mother was packing citrus fruit and lettuce in a warehouse. Calderon, who is now 18, has been diagnosed with autism and ADHD and has difficulty speaking, bathing, and with other basic tasks of daily life.\nCalwell, who said that the lifetime costs of care in such cases can range into the tens of millions of dollars, is now reviewing the records of another 50 potential plaintiffs. Meanwhile, Corteva is scheduled to enter settlement talks in another case on behalf of the daughter of a woman named Marisol Padilla, who was exposed to chlorpyrifos when she was pregnant in a rural community in Monterey, California, and whose daughter developed learning delays and disabilities.\nYears after studies found that rates of Parkinson\u2019s disease are measurably higher among people who have used paraquat, litigation against Syngenta, its manufacturer, is also increasing. More than 150 suits from around the country over Syngenta\u2019s responsibility for causing the disease were recently consolidated into a case that\u00a0is scheduled to be heard in federal court in the Southern District of Illinois.\nThe 2018 Roundup litigation shows that these cases may meaningfully cut into the companies\u2019 massive profits from these pesticides. That year, a groundskeeper named Dewayne Johnson who used Roundup before developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma won a $298 million judgment against Bayer. Although the stunning verdict, which found that the company acted with \u201cmalice, oppression, and fraud,\u201d was reduced to $20.5 million on appeal, there are now some 125,000 plaintiffs suing over glyphosate exposure, and Bayer has already agreed to pay $10.9 billion to settle three-quarters of them. The company\u2019s stock price, which fell 45 percent after the litigation, has not fully recovered.\nSome financial analysts are predicting that the chlorpyrifos suits may affect Dow and Corteva\u2019s bottom line too. In May, Bank of America downgraded Corteva stock, citing \u201cthe legacy Dow insecticide chlorpyrifos\u201d as its primary concern.\nMeanwhile, science showing that some of the effects from pesticides are passed down through generations suggests that the litigation may continue for decades to come. Calwell\u2019s team has documented evidence of the presence of chlorpyrifos and its breakdown products years after active spraying of the chemical had stopped, which may mean that litigation over chlorpyrifos continues long after the use of the pesticide has stopped.\nStill, close watchers of the pesticide industry remain skeptical that the lawsuits will fundamentally change how pesticide companies operate. \u201cWhatever it costs them in court is a calculated loss,\u201d said Benbrook. \u201cEven when they spend tens of millions, it is never going to be more than a share of their net profits.\u201d\nThe inescapable problem is the financial mismatch between the underfunded government agency and the immense corporations that continue to outfox, outmaneuver, and vastly outspend it, according to Benbrook.\n\u201cI can guarantee that Monsanto spent more than the entire OPP budget on that litigation. It had to have been way more,\u201d said Benbrook. \u201cHow can EPA fight these major chemical companies when they are willing to spend an amount of money that is roughly equivalent to the entire Office of Pesticide Programs annual budget to defend just one chemical?\u201d\nSharon Lerner[email\u00a0protected]\u200btheintercept.com@fastlerner\nPolice officers who were decertified by state regulators went on to find work at other departments and public safety agencies, records show.\nAlleen Brown reports on the latest oil company efforts to suppress water and land defense movements.\nPipeline opponents say an oil company and police use surveillance and divide-and-conquer strategies \u2014 hallmarks of corporate counterinsurgency.\n\u00a9 First Look Institute.

Shrier appeals to her audience\u2019s emotions by voicing their deepest fears to create uproar against an already marginalized community. The claims presented do not meet scientific rigor, yet have been praised and upheld by many, effectively pushing back against equal rights for gender minorities, and, more specifically, denying equitable healthcare for trans youth. This two-part review is based in a framework of evidence-based research and healthcare best practices to address, analyze, and dismantle Shrier\u2019s arguments. It seeks to elucidate the historical and current medicalization of trans identities, present the nidus of widely-accepted yet debunked beliefs, and give context to the research and sources Shrier builds upon for her book.\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the second guest post discussing Abigail Shrier\u2019s Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters solicited from experts in transgender medical care. In this post, Dr. A.J. Eckert describes the many errors, misrepresentations, and misunderstandings of science in Shrier\u2019s book, doing so in more detail than was done in our recent guest post by Dr. Rose Lovell, who provided an excellent overview of the problems with the book. Dr. Eckert plans a second part to this discussion, which they are currently working on. We look forward to its completion.\nOver the last couple of weeks, Abigail Shrier\u2019s controversial 2020 book Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters has enjoyed a renewed surge of interest and controversy on the Internet. On June 15, Dr. Harriet Hall, retired family physician and longtime contributor to the Science-Based Medicine blog, posted a favorable review of Shrier\u2019s book on SBM.\nThe physicians behind SBM characterize their blog as one \u201cdedicated to evaluating medical treatments and products of interest to the public in a scientific light and promoting the highest standards and traditions of science in health care\u201d. SBM is widely regarded in its dedication to evidence-based medicine. Hall\u2019s review was pulled from the SBM blog less than two days later for review, having been found not to meet the standards of SBM. Shrier sees this move as bullying. Others see it as censorship and a violation of free speech, for example, Alex Berenson:\nLol @ScienceBasedMed, edited by @gorskon, removes a review of a @AbigailShrier\u2019s book on transgenderism months after posting it \u2013 and then huffs, \u201cthis has nothing to do with silencing opinions.\u201d\nNo, they just thought it needed a different font! pic.twitter.com/o3viDl8S6r\nMs. Shrier, Lisa Littman, whose 2018 study proposed the diagnosis of \u201crapid onset gender dysphoria\u201d (ROGD), and now apparently Dr. Hall see themselves as victims of a \u201cwoke\u201d activist movement trying to censor science. Hall\u2019s review has already been republished on another website, one that is prominent in the circles of the skeptical movement. In contrast to claims of Shrier having been \u201csilenced,\u201d her book has garnered praise and support, with several sites taking up her cause in the past week alone. Before Dr. Hall\u2019s review, Shrier had previously appeared at a high-profile Senate hearing. She still has a platform as a columnist for the\u00a0Wall Street Journal and has expressed her views on several podcasts, including Joe Rogan\u2019s massively popular one. Meanwhile, in part due to Shrier\u2019s enthusiastic promotion, Littman\u2019s made-up diagnosis of ROGD has enjoyed a renewed interest, spread widely, and is accepted by many as a real medical diagnosis.\nBad science, however, remains bad science, and personal opinions based in confirmation bias and politicized beliefs are bad science.\nIrreversible Damage was published by politically conservative firm Regnery Publishing and claims to shed a light on \u201cbiological female teens caught up in this transgender craze.\u201d Shrier, a freelance journalist with a JD from Yale Law School, per her own admission, knew little about gender dysphoria before writing her book. She also admits to having negligible understanding of human anatomy, psychology, and endocrinology. (It shows.)\nThe book title alone is inflammatory and misleading, and clearly intended to alarm concerned parents, the target demographic for Shrier\u2019s book. Shrier uses emotional language throughout to appeal to the reader. Her book presents a mix of anecdotal reports, opinion pieces, and minimal cited research. The studies she cites are either misinterpreted or cherry-picked to only include those experts she deems reputable, all of whom have a problematic track record in transgender health and research. Her \u201cSelect Bibliography\u201d, an annotated version of which is included as an appendix to this post, lists resources that are equally problematic.\nThroughout her book, Shrier refers to her subjects as \u201cbiological girls,\u201d a term that conflates sex with gender and mischaracterizes Shrier\u2019s subjects. The reason is that a person\u2019s sex refers to the identity assigned by doctors, parents, and medical professionals at birth, most often based on external anatomy (genitals). Sex is often confused or interchanged with gender, which involves a person\u2019s own sense of their behaviors, characteristics, thoughts, and social factors, and is not determined by biological sex. A person\u2019s gender may or may not conform to the male and female binary and may or may not align with their sex assigned at birth.\nMore accurately, Shrier\u2019s subjects are \u201cAFAB\u201d, or \u201cassigned female at birth\u201c, because no one gets to choose what sex they\u2019re assigned at birth. When discussing transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, this terminology is generally preferred over \u201cbiological male/female\u201d, \u201cmale/female bodied\u201d, \u201cnatal male/female\u201d, and \u201cborn male/female\u201d, which are considered defamatory and inaccurate. Moreover, disturbingly, most of the individuals covered in Shrier\u2019s book were not personally interviewed. Their stories are told exclusively by their parents, all of whom use she/her pronouns for their trans children. (Throughout this review, I will be using the term \u201ctrans\u201d as an umbrella term for all transgender and gender non-conforming people. I acknowledge that some non-binary and gender non-conforming people do not identify as trans, and am using it solely based on its core definition: from Latin, \u201ctrans\u201d means on the opposite side. For identity, \u201ctrans\u201d means someone assigned a sex at birth that is different from their gender identity.) Shrier reports conducting nearly 200 interviews, with over 48 families, and admits, \u201cI have relied in part on parent accounts.\u201d\nShrier\u2019s use of she/her pronouns for her subjects, \u201cfor the sake of clarity and honesty\u201d, is also problematic. She defends her referring to these subjects using pronouns that do not correctly reflect the gender with which they identify, commonly referred to as \u201cmisgendering,\u201d by appealing to the First Amendment, a common strategy employed to attack the rights of LGBTQ people. For example, The Denial-of-Care Rule (now blocked, but at the time, released by the Department of Health and Human Services), allowed health care workers, in essence, to impose their religious beliefs on patients, and to decide who they will and will not treat, targeting both reproductive health care and gender-affirming care.\nThroughout her book, Shrier characterizes those who ask that their accurate names and pronouns are respected as demanding, volatile teenagers who \u201cfly into rage\u201d when their request is denied. She scoffs at pronouns in email signatures, referring to them as \u201cgender Ideology\u201d. Pronouns matter not only for trans visibility and understanding; research finds that for youth, their use can mean the difference between a distressing and positive experience. A 2018 study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that those youth who could use their accurate names and pronouns had 71% fewer symptoms of severe depression, a 34% drop in suicidal thoughts, and a 65% decrease in suicide attempts. Since Shrier\u2019s subjects\u2019 chosen pronouns are not disclosed, I will use they/them pronouns when discussing these individuals. Intentionally misgendering and deadnaming (calling them by their birth name after they have chosen a new name that fits their gender identity) trans people is disrespectful, harmful, and dangerous.\nThe following is Part One of a discussion of the arguments and claims in Shrier\u2019s book and where they go wrong. There is a lot to review here and, as my patients will tell you, I am not one for brevity. I will focus on the core beliefs forming the bedrock of Shrier\u2019s arguments: gender dysphoria in AFAB teenagers is the newest fad; woke gender ideology pushes teens into \u201cbecoming\u201d trans; Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria is real; the DSM-IV is the superior diagnostic manual because it classified trans identity as a mental illness; 80% of children desist from a trans identity; today\u2019s teens don\u2019t follow the correct rules for being trans and therefore are not trans but definitely are mentally ill.\nIn Part Two, we will discuss The Trans Agenda\u2122: turn all lesbians into trans men, tell teens it\u2019s not cool to be cisgender (having a gender identity that aligns with sex assigned at birth) and heterosexual, love-bomb teens that \u201ccome out\u201d so they stay in the trans community, coach teens to say they\u2019re suicidal so they can get on hormones, separate youth from their parents, and deny biology.\nWe will review the \u201cdangers\u201d of gender affirmation-social, medical, and surgical, discuss Shrier\u2019s underlying thoughts on all trans people, and address Shrier\u2019s solutions to the transgender craze. I will include some historical context and the complicated web of Shrier\u2019s sourced professionals and resources as well, both very important to acknowledge when discussing the healthcare of trans people.\nAccording to Shrier, \u201cbefore 2012, in fact, there was no scientific literature on girls ages 11-21 ever having developed gender dysphoria at all\u201d. A review of research studies reveals a 1998 research study on puberty delay in trans adolescents, an Introduction to Transmasculine Studies from 2005, 2011 medical guidelines for treatment of transgender youth, and those specific to transmasculine young people, and much more; there is a robust base of scientific literature on AFAB trans youth. One wonders if Shrier knows how to use Google and PubMed, given that these references are not difficult to find.\nShrier reports, \u201cfor the first time in medical history, natal girls\u2026constitute the majority\u201d (of the \u201csudden surge of adolescents claiming to have gender dysphoria\u201d). Her cited source examined sex ratios in children and adolescents referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) in the UK. The study found an increased ratio of adolescent referrals. Specifically, 32% were AMAB (assigned male at birth); 68% AFAB, which aligned with results from an Amsterdam clinic. However, a Toronto clinic reported a larger proportion of AMAB referrals. The limitations of Shrier\u2019s source are that it draws from anecdotal surveys, small databases, and inconsistent, soft studies, and neglects social/cultural factors, such as the fact that it is often easier for AFAB young people to \u201ccome out,\u201d especially since gender-variant behavior in AMAB (assigned male at birth) young people may be more exposing and lead to social stigma. Adolescents not seen at specialized clinics are not represented in gender dysphoria studies, a factor that skews the ratio, therefore, the study can only assume that the data reflects a real change in ratios in the overall trans youth population.\nThe sex assigned at birth ratio for trans adolescents is much closer to 1:1. This ratio appears to be consistent across nations. Though there has been a recent temporal shift to more AFAB trans adolescents, the ratio remains closer than 2:1 in either direction.\nShrier considers the following practices, oriented around school, to be the impetus for teens \u201cbecoming\u201d trans: asking students to state their name, sexual orientation, and gender pronouns; joining a Gay-Straight Alliance; making a trans friend; being taught that gender identity is in the brain, sexual attraction in the heart, and sex in the genitals; seeing counselors who may suggest that you are transgender; and teaching youth about gender identity and sexual orientation. These are characterized as a \u201cwoke gender ideology,\u201d an oft-recited phrase that is never really defined.\nShrier alleges that the mere mention of gender identity by an educator influences the identities of children and students. She even argues that education around trans youth as a fix to bullying is egregious. To her, all that is required is \u201cthat students display decency, civility and kindness to their classmates\u201d. This is in direct opposition of what the research shows: increased education and visibility of trans identities leads to better understanding and empathy for a population that experiences a disproportionate amount of school harassment. Shrier then goes on to warn that schools with LGBTQ curricula \u201cnormalize\u201d being LGBTQ, and this \u201cencourages adolescents to focus relentlessly on their own gender identities and sexual orientations\u201d. The research actually shows that greater LGBTQ representation is associated with increased empathy and decreased anti-trans bias.\nAccording to Shrier, the internet coaches and indoctrinates teenagers in \u201cradical trans ideology\u201d (again, whatever that means). She supports this claim with the following statement provided by a trans youth: \u201carguably, the internet is half the reason I had the courage to come out\u201d. This statement does not bolster Shrier\u2019s arguments. Research suggests that positive representation and increased visibility are crucial for minority populations; discussion and information about trans people reduces transphobia. Reducing transphobia increases public support for trans rights.\n\u201cNever before had gender dysphoria sufferers \u2018come out\u2019 as trans based on the encouragement of friends or following self-saturation in social media. Never before had identification as \u2018transgender\u2019 preceded the experience of gender dysphoria itself\u201d, Shrier contends. This is only partially true; never before has there been the widespread access to information and education that modern social media provide. Positive representation, as noted above, has helped more LGBTQ people recognize themselves and come out. Trans people have always existed; there\u2019s just more visibility now, and a chance to shift away from the negative characterizations of trans people in the media.\nThe idea that gender identity is influenced by friends and the media segues us into a discussion of ROGD, or Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria, a phenomenon Shrier endorses even though it is not a medical entity recognized by any major professional association and has no good evidence to support its existence. This bears repeating: Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria is a fake diagnosis, just like \u201cadrenal fatigue\u201c, a fake diagnosis favored by naturopaths.\nROGD is a diagnosis proposed by Lisa Littman of Brown University, to support the hypothesis of transgender identity as peer contagion. Littman coined the phrase to describe parents\u2019 accounts of their teenage children suddenly manifesting symptoms of gender dysphoria and self-identifying as transgender along with other children in their peer group. Littman speculated that ROGD could be a \u201csocial coping mechanism\u201d for other disorders. Her study was published in 2018 and pulled shortly thereafter, a move described by Shrier as \u201cactivists stormed the peer-reviewed scientific journal accusing her of anti-trans bigotry\u201d. Littman\u2019s study deliberately skewed results by drawing from blogs openly hostile to transgender youth, the same blogs where Littman developed the concept of ROGD in the first place. The study formed its conclusions around the beliefs of parents who already presupposed the existence of ROGD, since Littman only posted her survey on the three blogs that invented and promoted ROGD. Today, the entire research base of ROGD consists of one 2017 poster abstract of an online survey of 164 parents.\nThere are several similarities between Littman and Shrier: neither woman interviewed her trans teen subjects; neither had any previous experience working with transgender youth; both drew their conclusions primarily from reports by parents, who had their own views on their child\u2019s trans identity. Neither understand that \u201crapid onset\u201d is tough to characterize, because teens often delay coming out in hostile environments. Judging by the attitudes of parents surveyed, I would posit that their children were likely afraid to disclose due to minority stress factors including social stigma, fears of rejection, and very real concerns about violence. If a youth\u2019s coming out as trans seems to be \u201cout of the blue\u201d, it could well be because that youth is afraid to discuss their gender identity with their parents, whom they know to be hostile to a gender identity other than what was assigned at birth. \u201cRapid\u201d in ROGD describes the parents\u2019 sudden awareness of their child\u2019s gender dysphoria, which, for the child, may be longstanding and consistent. ROGD as an argument is packaged to describe the speed of onset and spread of gender dysphoria among teen friend groups. \u201cRapid\u201d in this context does not describe the speed of gender dysphoria onset and spread. Logically: a study that only surveys parents about their observations tells us nothing about their child\u2019s internal sense of identity.\nDisaffirming approaches to care, such as those advocated by proponents of ROGD, have been shown to lead to high rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and poor school performance. Depression, anxiety, substance use, and poor school performance primarily manifest in those youth living in unsupportive environments. The only social contagion supported by scientific research is the change in attitude about anti-transgender prejudice. Friend clusters are a good thing for trans youth; supportive friends are directly associated with positive well-being. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that gender identity is contagious. In fact, the social contagion argument has been used against the LGBTQ community in various forms for decades.\nShrier identifies a \u201creal\u201d transgender person as one for whom \u201cthe body feels wrong,\u201d and for whom \u201cthe only option is to present as the opposite sex.\u201d She states that \u201cthey want to pass.\u201d\nThe term \u201cpassing\u201d is complicated. Being able to \u201cpass\u201d means that a trans man is seen by society as a man and is gendered correctly. \u201cPassing\u201d means avoiding the pain of being misgendered. For many trans people, \u201cpassing\u201d means safety. \u201cPassing\u201d, however, also implies playing at a gender. Trans people are already the gender they say they are. \u201cPassing\u201d also reinforces gender stereotypes and enforces a pressure to conform to these stereotypes. \u201cPassing\u201d implies that the ultimate goal for trans people is to be perceived as cisgender. It means molding oneself to fit a cisnormative (the assumption that cisgender is the norm, privileged over any other form of gender identity) society.\nNot all trans people want to pass. Nonbinary and gender non-conforming people don\u2019t pass, according to societal standards. As one writer notes, \u201cSocial conservatives\u2019 biggest problem with transgender people isn\u2019t that we exist, but that we don\u2019t police the boundaries of our identity strictly enough for their liking.\u201d\nShrier writes that gender dysphoria presents in early childhood, around ages 2-4. This is not accurate; around 2-4 years old, children understand their gender identity. Most trans children experience gender dysphoria around age 7, and, although it manifests in early childhood, gender dysphoria can persist for years before patients take any steps toward gender affirmation.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, firmly established in the medical world as the source for psychiatric codes and diagnoses, is sourced by Shrier in her definition of \u201ctraditional gender dysphoria\u201d, her made-up term that further alienates those who deviate from her standards. Of note, the DSM does not specify age of onset in its diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.\nIt is important to Shrier that we know that gender dysphoria was previously known as Gender Identity Disorder. She uses an outdated version of the DSM manual, DSM-IV, and conflates gender dysphoria with gender identity disorder to define it as characterized by a severe and persistent discomfort in one\u2019s biological sex. Shrier\u2019s criteria for \u201ctraditional gender dysphoria\u201d mean a bodily discomfort that must be \u201cexcruciating\u201d. Per Shrier, in those cases only, medical transition may be indicated\u2026maybe.\nFor context, the DSM-IV was published in 1994, with the newest version, the DSM-V, published in 2013. Citing an outdated version of the DSM and an outdated diagnosis ignores the advancements in healthcare and scientific research over a period of nearly 20 years. To quote the American Psychiatric Association, publishers and editors of the DSM (bolding is mine):\nWith the publication of DSM\u20135 in 2013, \u201cgender identity disorder\u201d was eliminated and replaced with \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d This change further focused the diagnosis on the gender identity-related distress that some transgender people experience (and for which they may seek psychiatric, medical, and surgical treatments) rather than on transgender individuals or identities themselves. The presence of gender variance is not the pathology but dysphoria is from the distress caused by the body and mind not aligning and/or societal marginalization of gender-variant people. It needs to be ego-dystonic to qualify as a diagnosis and having a discussion with our patients about the diagnosis prior to charting it is necessary and good care. The DSM\u20135 articulates explicitly that \u201cgender non-conformity is not in itself a mental disorder.\u201d The 5th edition also includes a separate \u201cgender dysphoria in children\u201d diagnosis and for the first time allows the diagnosis to be given to individuals with disorders of sex development (DSD). DSM\u20135 also includes the optional \u201cpost-transition\u201d specifier to indicate when a particular individual\u2019s gender transition is complete. In this \u201cpost-transition\u201d case, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria would no longer apply but the individual may still need ongoing medical care (e.g., hormonal treatment). Nevertheless, discussions continue among advocates and medical professionals about how best to preserve access to gender transition-related health care while also minimizing the degree to which such diagnostic categories stigmatize the very people that physicians are attempting to help.\nThe Gender Dysphoria diagnosis functions as a double-edged sword. It provides an avenue for treatment, making medical and surgical options available to TGNC [Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming] people. However, it also has the potential to stigmatize TGNC people by categorizing them as mentally ill. The ultimate goal would be to categorize TGNC treatment under an endocrine/medical diagnosis. In the past, TGNC patients were disproportionally diagnosed with psychotic/mood disorders to explain their gender variance. Because of this, many in the community are understandably skeptical of mental health and psychiatric care.\nBy citing the DSM-IV, Shrier establishes her reality where being transgender is a pathology to be fixed. This belief undermines science and harms trans people. She makes statements such as the following: \u201ctrans influencers typically promote trans as a lifestyle to celebrate, not the result of a malady they hope to cure\u201d. Categorizing trans identity as a mental illness requires that all \u201creal\u201d trans people experience gender dysphoria. A grave result of pathologizing transgender identity is the resulting impact on human rights, which negatively influences every aspect of trans lives.\nResearch finds that as many as 41.5% of trans people have a mental health diagnosis or substance use disorder. This is widely accepted to be a consequence of minority stress, the chronic stress from societal stigma and discrimination experienced by trans people due to their identity and expression. To reiterate, trans identity in itself is not a mental health disorder. A gender identity is not a mental disorder. Being trans is not an illness to be fixed and eradicated.\nJ. Michael Bailey, whom Shrier interviews, is a psychologist at Northwestern University, whose controversial 2003 book, The Man Who Would Be Queen (included in Shrier\u2019s bibliography), endorses a pseudoscientific view of trans people developed by psychologist Ray Blanchard, and was noted to be dangerous to the social progress of the trans community. Unsurprisingly, Bailey claims to have been \u201csilenced\u201d by the trans community and supports Shrier\u2019s views, having been quoted thusly in her book: \u201cWe have scant evidence that gender identity-a person\u2019s ineffable sense of (their) own gender-is immutable. In fact, we have very good evidence that in many cases it is not.\u201d (Conveniently, he provides no source for this latter claim.) Bailey is a proponent of Littman\u2019s hypothesis of ROGD as well and exhibits disinterest in learning from the community he claims to help, shrugging his shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the correct language is and I don\u2019t really care.\u201d\nIn another chapter, Shrier interviews Dr. Paul McHugh, a key figure in the academic pathologization of sex and gender minorities, who refers to gender dysphoria as an \u201covervalued idea\u201d and \u201cruling passion.\u201d McHugh is no ally to the LGBTQ community; he shut down his gender clinic at Johns Hopkins in 1979, alleging that he \u201cwasted scientific and technical resources and damaged (our clinic\u2019s) professional credibility by collaborating with madness rather than trying to study, cure, and ultimately prevent it.\u201d McHugh also endorses Blanchard and Bailey\u2019s views, is a proponent of conversion therapy, and continues to oppose \u201cthe transgender cause.\u201d In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, he states:\nThis intensely felt sense of being transgendered constitutes a mental disorder in two respects. The first is that the idea of sex misalignment is simply mistaken\u2014it does not correspond with physical reality. The second is that it can lead to grim psychological outcomes. The transgendered suffer a disorder of \u201cassumption\u201d like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature\u2014namely one\u2019s maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight.\nShrier also often compares being trans with anorexia. The American Psychiatric Association guidelines of affirming care are, to Shrier, politically correct gender ideology, and akin to affirming an anorexic who thinks she\u2019s fat as correct in her assessment. She compares affirming trans patients to a black girl who wants to be white and is affirmed by doctors that she is, in fact, white. Having established these false equivalencies, Shrier goes on to lament that, for the girl with anorexia and the one who desires to be white, \u201cwe would cry out for the therapist not to encourage the girl\u2019s distorted perception\u201d. Additionally, she writes, \u201cwe would never want (therapists) to automatically agree with the patient\u2019s self-diagnosis\u2026in fact, it still isn\u2019t the mental health professional\u2019s job with regard to any other psychiatric condition\u201d. These statements belie Shrier\u2019s understanding of being trans as a mental health disorder, despite medical consensus that variations in gender expression represent normal dimensions of human development, and the removal of gender identity disorder from the DSM nearly 20 years ago.\nThe belief that a diagnosis is clinically required to access gender affirming care, known as transmedicalism, can contribute to stigma and discrimination toward transgender individuals. Gender dysphoria is not a requirement of being trans. To this, Shrier snarks, \u201cthose of us plagued with social anxiety are officially on notice: we\u2019re probably \u201ctrans\u201d. Dismissive and offensive comments like these belie Shrier\u2019s point: these AFAB teens don\u2019t qualify as \u201creal\u201d trans people. Shrier has firmly established herself in the long line of cisgender people passing judgement on and pathologizing transgender people. Though she admits to limited knowledge about dysphoria prior to writing her book, learning from trans people and about trans identities has never been a criteria to being an expert on trans health; Shrier fits into this narrative just fine. In the case of these AFAB teens, Shrier is clear: in her mind, none of them exhibit \u201ctraditional dysphoria,\u201d therefore, they are not actually trans.\nShrier appeals to traditional sex stereotypes to invalidate her subjects\u2019 gender identities: she characterizes a subject as \u201ca girly girl\u201d who liked to dress up in high heels and frilly dresses in their childhood, another as having the \u201cprospect of becoming a professional ballet dancer\u201d. Shrier extolls the virtues of womanhood while carrying a prejudice against transmasculine youth for exhibiting feminine traits. According to Shrier, to even be considered valid in their identity, trans men must meet a high standard of masculinity.\nA good example of trans masculinity, as reported by Shrier, is Brandon Teena, a young man who was targeted and murdered for being trans. Brandon presented as a man and had a girlfriend. He was 21 years old when he died in 1993; his life and death were portrayed in the movie Boys Don\u2019t Cry. Brandon Teena was deadnamed and mischaracterized by the epithets on his gravestone; Shrier is content to do the same, although she does slip up and use his chosen name in one instance. She summarizes Brandon Teena\u2019s life as one spent chasing \u201ca strikingly conservative vision of happiness\u201d.\nThough Shrier weaponizes classic gender stereotypes against trans people, in another chapter, she blames schools for introducing kids to gender stereotypes to push a gender ideology. She says, \u201cgender ideologues make sure (she) learns that things like sports and math are for boys. It\u2019s essential that (she) learns gender stereotypes because, without them, \u201cgender identity\u201d makes no sense at all\u201d. Shrier appeals to gender essentialism, also known as biological essentialism or determinism, the idea that men and women have inherent, unique, and natural attributes that qualify them as their separate gender, that these differences are often biological or sexual, and that behaviors, interests or abilities are biologically pre-determined, rather than shaped by society. A gender essentialist ignores the evidence of a sex and gender spectrum and believes that gender and sex are identical, therefore it is impossible to have a sex assigned at birth that does not match gender identity. In this framework, gender affirmation is a submission to essentialist thought: trans people are making their bodies more feminine or masculine, thus promoting the fusion of sex and gender. Gender essentialism theory supports Shrier\u2019s claim that gender identity makes no sense without learning gender stereotypes. Essentialist ideas, now viewed as outdated and inaccurate, ground the male/female binary in biology and may lead to more prejudice against trans people.\nGender essentialism and Shrier\u2019s conclusion about gender identity are based in faulty assumptions. Gender affirmation is different from \u201cbecoming the opposite sex\u201d. The former acknowledges that trans people are already men, women, or non-binary people exploring ways to better express their gender identity; the latter implies that trans people are not valid until they alter their bodies, precludes the existence of non-binary people, assumes there is only one way to transition and ignores gender expression (e.g., butch trans women/femme trans men) and genderqueer identities.\nA recent first-of-its-kind study examines the origins of essentialist thinking and the differences between cisgender and transgender children\u2019s views of gender essentialism. Findings suggest that all children might develop an essentialist view of gender early in life, even if their own gender experiences are at odds with certain aspects of essentialism. These findings infer that children essentialize categories even when their own identities cross category boundaries. The study also suggests that transgender children might share other children\u2019s intuitions that gender, even their own gender, is inborn and biologically determined. Trans children might believe that what led to their gender identity and expression was some aspect of their biology, even though it did not align with their sex assigned at birth. Trans children might be as essentialist as cis children\u2014they might just ascribe gender identity, rather than sex assigned at birth, as an essentialized attribute.\nShrier sees everyone in terms of a \u201cboy-girl\u201d dichotomy, implying a binary system not supported by science. She writes that \u201cgirls are different\u201d, with different inclinations and gifts, and possessed of empathy and deeper emotions. In turn, she encourages AFAB youth to \u201cstop taking sex stereotypes so seriously\u201d. Yet Shrier claims that AFAB trans teens are not valid because they don\u2019t adhere to gender stereotypes. She contradicts herself with the assertion that AFAB trans teens \u201cregard men as the measure of all things\u201d when she states that AFAB trans teens \u201cdefinitely\u201d do not want to be seen as \u201ccis men\u201d.\nOf Youtuber Chase Ross, a trans man interviewed by Shrier who later issued an apology for appearing in the book, Shrier notes: \u201cwhile he could pass as a small man if he wanted to, he seems to have something else in mind. His earrings, cat tattoos, flop of hair dyed every vivid shade of parrot, and nail polish all slyly nod toward the sex of his birth.\u201d This assertion precludes the existence of gender non-conforming people outside of the binary, and is harmful to anyone, including cisgender people, whose gender expression deviates from traditional sex stereotypes.\nShrier understands AFAB trans people as those who exclusively date and are attracted to women, making note of her AFAB subjects who have \u201cdated boys\u201d as another reason to distrust their trans status. Shrier \u2013 and she will elucidate this argument later \u2013 believes that trans men are actually just butch lesbians, and her hope, framed as concern for young AFAB teens, is that they will turn back and embrace their intended womanhood. AFAB trans teens are also not valid, because, as Shrier states: \u201cthey almost never undergo the phalloplasty necessary to achieve one of the defining features of manhood, (so) it\u2019s hard not to see their male identities as fragile; a quick trip to a urinal, and the jig is up\u201d.\nThis statement again conflates sex with gender and reinforces a gender binary. Centering the understanding of a real man around genitalia is dismissive of transmasculine people who are not possessed of a penis and harmful to women and non-binary people who have a penis. In 2019, the American Psychiatric Association released new guidelines for psychological practice with boys and men, addressing the psychological harms of traditional masculinity, and defining multiple masculinities inclusive of sexual and gender minorities.\nAlthough Shrier concedes that phalloplasty is complicated, she does not make the connection that this may be one of the reasons that some AFAB trans people do not move forward with the surgery. Other reasons include financial constraints, inadequate insurance coverage, and a relative dearth of surgeons who both perform genital gender affirming surgery and accept insurance. Finding a competent surgeon who is trustworthy, knowledgeable about trans health issues, and accessible cost- and location-wise, is a near-impossible task. Shrier\u2019s final argument against AFAB trans teens is that their parents deny signs of gender dysphoria in childhood. For example, one subject wanted to be a boy at 4-5 years old and cut their own hair; however, according to mom, their \u201cdesire to be a boy was neither pronounced, severe, or persistent.\u201d Another mother reports that \u201cher (child) just didn\u2019t seem like a boy trapped in a girl\u2019s body\u201d.\nShrier writes that gender dysphoria resolves in 70% of children who identify as trans. This statement sees her confusing two separate claims. The 70% statistic comes from Dr. Kenneth Zucker, who stated that a full 70% of the children he saw at his clinic for treatment did not have gender dysphoria in the first place. The \u201cgender dysphoria resolves\u201d statistic is 80%, a number widely bandied by the media, public, and journals to suggest that 80% of transgender children will come to identify as cisgender in adolescence or early adulthood. Though this statistic has been debunked many times and came to be known as the \u201cdesistance myth\u201c, the widely acknowledged presumption is that most trans children will desist, a presumption that raises questions around whether we should support the gender identities of trans children.\nBetween 2008 and 2013, four follow-up studies on trans children were published in peer-reviewed journals. The studies were (separately) conducted at a clinic in Toronto and a clinic in the Netherlands. Though the estimates of desistance drawn from the studies are those widely quoted today, all four studies had serious methodological concerns.\nThe original studies used the (at the time current) diagnostic criteria of Gender Identity Disorder in the DSM-IV, which were predominately focused on gender expression, meaning that cisgender children, such as AFAB \u201ctomboys\u201d and AMAB boys who liked to play with feminine-coded toys, and other children with gender non-conforming behaviors, were included in the GID category. (Gender expression is how a person publicly expresses or presents their gender. This can include behavior and outward appearance such as dress, hair, make-up, body language and voice. Others perceive a person\u2019s gender through these attributes.) These children never claimed to be transgender, so, rather unsurprisingly, most were not transgender at follow-up. Despite never expressing gender dysphoria or trans identity, these patients were classified as desistors. 40% of the participants in the study did not even meet the then-current DSM IV diagnostic criteria; similarly, these participants, who were never identified as gender dysphoric, became classified as desistors. Research was limited to those children whose parents brought them to the clinic for diagnosis and treatment, believing that their child\u2019s identity was a problem requiring psychiatric treatment. If a young adult followed by the study since childhood was not pursuing medical and/or surgical gender affirmation, the assumption was made that they were desisting. Participants lost to follow up were also classified as desisters. The four clinics had high ratios of participants who did not follow up: 22%, 25%, 30%, and 32%. Lack of re-engagement with the clinic, for whatever reason, was counted as desistance.\nAll four studies failed to acknowledge: not all trans people medically transition; socioeconomic and/or cultural factors; negative clinic experiences; those who moved, were institutionalized, or died; and finally, the possibility that some people repress their gender identity. The studies used a binary gender framework, ignoring gender non-conforming identities and intersex people. The studies conflated gender identity and sexual orientation, leading to statements such as \u201cthe majority of those who desist by or during adolescent grow up to be gay, not transgender\u201d, as if those two options are mutually exclusive.\nUnderscoring all of this is that the 80% statistic is employed to justify delaying social transition, which signals to trans children that they are not to be trusted and that they are not valued for who they are. The insidious undercurrent of all appeals to not affirming children in their identity is that we must, first and foremost, protect cisgender children from the possibility of \u201cmistakenly\u201d transitioning, even if this means exposing trans children to the stress of living in a gender they do not identify with.\nIt is important to note that the children in the Dutch clinic were discouraged from social affirmation prior to puberty. Those in the Toronto clinic were treated according to a schema that sought to lower the odds of patients growing up to be transgender and reduce the likelihood of GID persistence.\nThe latter clinic, CAMH\u2019s Child Youth and Family Gender Identity Clinic, was run by Zucker and Blanchard (yes, the Blanchard discussed earlier). In 2003, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) reported that Zucker practiced \u201csomething disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals\u201d. Zucker\u2019s conversion efforts were designed to make transgender people cisgender. These efforts would include tactics such as forcing the child to play with same-sex friends and removing the child from gender-atypical activities. [See correction in Addendum.]\nZucker claims that 80% of children with gender dysphoria will desist; investigators reviewed his patient files and found that 72% of the children treated by Zucker never met the clinical criteria for gender dysphoria, as noted by Zucker himself. This means that 90% of the patients Zucker claimed to \u201ccure\u201d were never transgender in the first place. Unsurprisingly, Shrier includes an interview with Zucker for her book in which she extols his virtues, believing that Zucker was \u201cstunningly successful\u201d in his treatment of dysphoric children because 88% of them outgrew their gender dysphoria. Of course, children can\u2019t outgrow something they never had.\nShrier writes, \u201cuntil the 2015 controversy that cost him his job, Kenneth Zucker was universally recognized as an international expert on child and adolescent gender dysphoria\u201d. Zucker ascribed to outdated and harmful conversion therapy practices, and following provincial legislation outlawing gender identity change efforts, his clinic was shut down. Shrier characterizes the damaging conversion therapy that Zucker exposed his young patients to as: \u201che helped children and adolescents with GD grow more comfortable in their bodies\u201d. McHugh sees conversion therapy as \u201cstriving to restore natural gender feelings to a transgender minor\u201d, an approach discredited by every major professional medical organization.\nCountering this narrative, a cross-sectional study of 27,715 U.S. trans adults found that recalled exposure to gender identity conversion efforts was significantly associated with severe psychological distress in the previous month and lifetime suicide efforts. Those exposed to gender identity conversion efforts before age 10 had a significantly increased risk of lifetime suicide attempts. A 2019 study followed a cohort of children aged 3-12: over 300 trans children, who had socially, but not medically, transitioned; nearly 200 of their cis siblings; and approximately 300 unrelated cis children (the control group). Two-thirds of the children were AFAB. The study found that there is almost no difference between transgender and cisgender kids in knowing their gender identity, in how they identify with or express their gender. The researchers note that this was especially surprising since the transgender children were, prior to social affirmation, treated as a gender other than the one they currently identify as. A prior study echoed these findings.\nCiting a Joe Rogan podcast, Shrier states \u201cadolescent girls today are in a lot of pain\u201d. She notes a depression rate in teen girls that is three times higher than that of boys, and a 25% increase in suicide rates between 2009 and 2017. The article cited reports an increase in suicide contemplation by 25%, not suicide rate. These statistics apply to cisgender girls only, and it is disingenuous to pretend that they include trans youth, in whom the rate of suicide attempt is closer to 50%.\nIf Shrier is extrapolating this suicide statistic to apply to white girls, (her characterization of AFAB trans teens; white, upper-class, with nothing to rebel against), a systematic review and meta-analysis on gender differences in suicidal behavior in adolescents undermines this; multi-racial students were the most likely to consider suicide, followed by American Indian and Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander students. Overall, cisgender males were still more likely to commit suicide.\nShrier believes that healthcare guidelines for trans people are driven by political correctness, not biology. Though evidence strongly suggests that gender identity, like sexual orientation, is innate, there is support in the scientific literature for a biological basis of gender identity, although using this approach relies on the previously-discussed concept of biological/gender essentialism. Research studies on people with differences in sex development (DSD) notes that those with an XY genotype felt more comfortable when raised as boys, despite being raised as female and undergoing genitoplasty at birth. Data highlights the potential influence of abnormal hormone exposure on the development of trans identity in some individuals (although it is important to note that most trans identity development cannot be explained by atypical sexual differentiation.)\nA biological origin of trans identity is also supported by a base of evidence noting atypical sexual differentiation of the brain. The perception of one\u2019s gender identity is linked to the brain and differs from the body phenotype in trans people. The degree of genital masculinization may not reflect that of the brain. Postmortem brain studies have noted trans-specific cerebral phenotypes. Brain phenotypes for trans people seem to exist. There may be evidence for the role of genetic factors and exposures affecting development of trans identity, although no studies to date demonstrate the mechanism.\nOn one hand, studies supporting a biological cause for trans identity help establish a reality of gender identity based in science. On the other, biological essentialism does not equal acceptance of trans people, as noted earlier. A study of university students exposed to an article with a strong bioessentialist view of gender identity demonstrated increased prejudice toward trans individuals. Biological essentialism also lends support to arguments that trans people are broken and can be fixed, that their behaviors are culturally driven and can be adapted to their sex assigned as birth. This debate directly echoes the one around the gay gene, widely popular and discussed in the 90s and early 2000s. Establishing a biological basis for homosexuality would have potentially lent legitimacy to LGB sexual orientations; however, the discovery of a \u201cgay gene\u201d could lead to the systemic eradication of sexual orientations outside of heterosexuality.\nThe modern debate is identical aside from substituting gender identity for sexual orientation. Throughout history, anti-LGBTQ groups have claimed that sexual orientation and gender identity is a \u201cchoice\u201d. The risks of finding biological underpinnings of both sexual orientation and gender identity are clear. Scientific research has long debunked the assertions that LGBTQ people are deviant, broken, and detrimental to society. The scientific consensus is that trying to change LGBTQ people through \u201cconversion therapy\u201d programs is harmful. LGBTQ identities are deeply complex, normal, and natural variations of human sexuality and gender identity. Maybe science should focus less on the causes of identity and sexuality variation, and more on challenging the discrimination and inequities sexual and gender minorities face on a daily basis. Indeed, it is worth questioning which side is politicized. A press release by the American Medical Association (AMA)\u2014certainly not a \u201cwoke\u201d liberal organization!\u2014that supports APA guidelines states that the American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Psychiatric Association, Pediatric Endocrine Society, and World Professional Association for Transgender Health, all major medical organizations, \u201coppose the dangerous intrusion of government into the practice of medicine and the criminalization of health care decision-making\u201d.\nShrier writes an entire chapter on gender-affirming therapists. She opens with a joke: a woman walks into a clinic with her son and tells the therapist that her son thinks he\u2019s a chicken. The therapist asserts that the son is a chicken. The punchline, per Shrier: \u2018This is, roughly, the scenario created by \u201caffirmative care.\u201d\u2018 Going beyond that crass and offensive joke, Shrier continues, claiming that therapists today \u201cmust agree\u2026that a male with gender dysphoria who identifies as a woman really is a woman\u201d. Gender identity is innate; a person\u2019s genital assortment only describes sex assigned at birth and does not always inform gender. Shrier counters, \u201caffirmative therapy compels therapists to endorse a falsehood: not that a teenage (youth) feels more comfortable presenting as a boy-but that (he) actually is a boy\u201d.\nShrier understands that all major professional medical organizations endorse gender affirming care. To her, this endorsement means that that the doctor is no longer in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to medical judgement; instead, the patient is in control. The gender affirming model means that doctors believe their patients who identify as trans. Informed consent is a step toward healing the insidious and damaging history of cisgender doctors setting arbitrary and subjective requirements for transgender patients.\n\u201cGet on board with \u201caffirmative therapy\u201d-or lose your job and maybe your license,\u201d Shrier warns.\nIn Shrier\u2019s words, gender affirming care is \u201cfashionable,\u201d an assertion both damaging and inaccurate. Only 20 states in the United States have laws banning conversion therapy for minors. 4 states partially ban conversion therapy. 23 states and 4 territories have no state law or policy on conversion therapy. This year, legislatures in 20 states proposed banning health care providers from delivering medically necessary gender-affirming care to transgender and gender-diverse minors. In April, Arkansas became the first state to outlaw any gender-affirming medical treatments for trans youth, overriding a veto from the governor.\nTrans youth experience significant disparities that are compounded by the endless wave of inflammatory and baseless opinion, masked as concern. As evident in this review, the same names and sources come up again and again, in a toxic feedback loop that does not allow for difference in opinion (or gender identity) or counterarguments. To certain groups, the \u201ctrans agenda\u201d is real, and gender-affirming care is dangerous. Reviewing the history of trans healthcare sheds a light on Shrier\u2019s insights, which are not new, just repackaged in rhetoric that appeals to a mass audience.\nPart Two will explore these concepts.\nIn 2003, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) reported that Zucker practiced \u201csomething\u00a0disturbingly close\u00a0to reparative therapy for homosexuals\u201d.\nThis was an unintentional mischaracterization, as it implies that the AACAP had released a statement to that effect. The text should read:\nIn 2003, Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist Dr. Pickstone-Taylor, advocate against the pathologization of children with Gender Diversity,\u00a0was quoted in the JAACAP\u00a0(Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry) saying Zucker practiced \u201csomething disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals\u201d. This concern was raised by\u00a0other\u00a0healthcare professionals. In his 1990 research paper\u00a0\u201cTreatment of gender identity disorders in children\u201c, Zucker himself writes:\u00a0\u201cA fourth rationale for the treatment of cross-gender identification in children is the prevention of transsexualism in adulthood. There is little controversy in this rationale, given the emotional distress experienced by gender-dysphoric adults and the physically and often socially painful measures required to align an adult\u2019s phenotypic sex with his or her subjective gender identity.\u201d\nDr. AJ Eckert, D.O.

It\u2019s not uncommon for job candidates to ask Amazon\u2019s recruiters about an infamous New York Times story from 2015 that reported corporate employees routinely cry at their desks. Amazon corporate managers have goals for \u201cunregretted attrition\u201d \u2014 basically a percentage of their staff that should leave the company each year, either voluntarily or by being forced out.\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has famously said the company\u2019s goal is to be the \u201cEarth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u201d and for decades that singular focus seems to have come at the expense of nearly all else. But now a growing swath of its employees say this singular focus has helped perpetuate a race problem inside Amazon \u2014 and, crucially, that attempts to address it over the years have been stymied by the company\u2019s HR department and its leader.\nPearl Thomas, a 64-year-old Black woman and human resources business partner, is one of these employees. She worked at Amazon for less than a year before she sued the company this May for alleged racial discrimination and retaliation. Her lawsuit is one of five different suits filed in recent months from current and former Amazon employees that detail shocking allegations of racial discrimination.\nThe plaintiffs, who are all women of color, claim they\u2019ve experienced both explicit racism at work \u2014 like being called the n-word by a manager \u2014 and systemic racism that they say is reflected in the company\u2019s alleged lower promotion rates and higher termination rates for underrepresented minorities. Thomas\u2019s suit stands out because she works for the company\u2019s HR department \u2014 which is supposed to not only hire and fire employees but also make sure they feel safe and satisfied at work.\nThomas claims in the filing that after she reported her white male manager for calling her the n-word when he thought she had already disconnected from a video call, Amazon\u2019s HR division investigated but ultimately dismissed her claim when it couldn\u2019t find proof. She also alleges that shortly after she complained, the manager retaliated against her by placing her on a performance review plan. On another occasion, Thomas alleges that she and a Black coworker were told by another manager that they should watch their tone so they wouldn\u2019t be perceived as \u201cangry Black wom[e]n.\u201d\n\u201cHer position in the Company\u2019s HR organization has given her a prime vantagepoint regarding both systemic discrimination and conscious animus towards Black employees at Amazon, along with the Company\u2019s practices regarding diversity, employee complaints, and the use of performance management to retaliate against Black and other employees who raise concerns,\u201d Thomas\u2019s lawyers wrote in the legal complaint.\nAmazon told Recode last month that it was \u201cconducting thorough investigations\u201d in light of the lawsuits, but that it had \u201cfound no evidence to support the allegations.\u201d\nBut many of Thomas\u2019s colleagues across the company tell Recode they\u2019ve had experiences similar to those mentioned in the suits. Over the past few months, Recode has interviewed more than 30 current and former Amazon employees who detailed allegations of racial bias and discrimination on the job \u2014 and many of them said the company\u2019s HR department was part of the problem.\nMore than a dozen of those sources, all of whom have worked in diversity, equity, and inclusion roles inside Amazon, told Recode that they believe Amazon\u2019s HR leader, Beth Galetti, who is white, was for years one of the main barriers to Amazon becoming an equitable workplace for employees of all races.\n\u201cBeth is actively a gatekeeper and a blocker in this work,\u201d a former Amazon diversity employee told Recode.\nAmazon spokesperson Jaci Anderson said it was unfair and biased to label Galetti as a barrier to diversity and inclusion success at the company. Anderson said that since last June, Galetti and her team have been leading discussions every two weeks with the company\u2019s senior leadership team on new goals related to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) work, as well as how to remove impediments to progress toward the goals.\nStill, diversity experts at Amazon told Recode that as long as Galetti oversees DEI work, they believe they won\u2019t have the freedom, data, and tools they need to identify and solve issues related to racial inequity. Recode granted the sources for this story anonymity either because they feared retribution from Amazon or because company policy prohibits them, as current employees, from speaking to the press without permission.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee and have thoughts on this topic?\u00a0Please email Jason Del Rey at jason@recode.net or jasondelrey@protonmail.com. His phone number and Signal number are available upon request by email.\nBut sources also told Recode that they believe the root of the problem goes deeper than Galetti \u2014 that she represents the company\u2019s ethos but isn\u2019t its inventor. They said Amazon\u2019s corporate culture has long encouraged cutthroat competition between coworkers and that it often prioritizes defending the tech giant\u2019s reputation above almost all else \u2014 including diversity, racial equity, and inclusion work.\nCase in point: After Recode published a report in February that revealed racial disparities in Amazon performance review grades and allegations of other systemic racial issues, the company promised to investigate potential inequities and announced more ambitious diversity-focused hiring and representation goals. But Recode has learned that at the same time, there has been upheaval in Amazon\u2019s core diversity, equity, and inclusion department and that Amazon temporarily placed an employment lawyer in charge of the team\u2019s day-to-day work \u2014 one who had no DEI experience prior to joining the diversity team a few months earlier.\nAll of this has left many of the people whose work is meant to make Amazon a more equitable place feeling like they can\u2019t do their jobs. \u201cThere\u2019s just a sense of distress across the board for [diversity] professionals at Amazon,\u201d a current employee told Recode.\nWe work hard to make Amazon a company where employees and people of all backgrounds feel included, respected, and want to grow their careers. This starts with recruiting to ensure our teams are diverse, and is continued by the work of the hundreds of diversity, equity, and inclusion experts that make up DEI teams across Amazon. While these teams are singularly focused on building an inclusive work environment and ensuring equitable access for all, we know that true diversity, equity, and inclusion starts with every senior leader, hiring manager, and Amazon employee being part of the solution. This is why we require inclusion training for all employees and have shared our 2021 goals and progress globally, in addition to implementing mechanisms that help us gather real-time employee feedback so we can adjust as we go.\nGaletti, the HR leader, is just one person. Sources told Recode that of course she is not the only one at fault for the race problem they believe exists at Amazon. But sources told Recode that they believe Galetti had for years failed at her job, particularly as a member of CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019s core leadership team, to sufficiently promote and support diversity and inclusion work inside Amazon and to ensure it was an equitable workplace.\n\u201cBlame rests with Beth,\u201d an HR employee who has worked at Amazon for more than five years, told Recode. \u201cShe\u2019s been the architect of the people-focused projects during these years of hyper growth. If it\u2019s not her responsibility, whose is it?\u201d\nThere have been some recent shifts. Four years into her HR leadership role, Galetti began leading discussions with other members of Jeff Bezos\u2019s leadership team every two weeks to discuss and review aggressive new diversity goals and progress for the company. This new focus for Galetti and Amazon leaders came last summer, as Amazon, like many large corporations, began making new commitments focused on Black Americans in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder. But until that catalyst, sources told Recode that they believe Galetti didn\u2019t prioritize DEI work.\nA major issue with Galetti\u2019s leadership, according to former diversity staffers, is that she seemed to downplay or resist the idea that some employees in underrepresented groups are at a natural disadvantage compared to their peers.\nOne source recounted a meeting between Galetti and members of Amazon\u2019s diversity staff several years ago, during which Galetti was confronted with data showing that Black employees at Amazon hit a promotion ceiling at certain levels in the company\u2019s corporate hierarchy. According to a person familiar with the exchange, Galetti replied: \u201cThese people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps like I did.\u201d Galetti\u2019s head of diversity work at the time, a Black executive with experience at a Fortune 100 company, attempted to explain that the Black employees didn\u2019t have metaphorical \u201cboots\u201d \u2014 which the source took as an allusion to the systemic racism they face in society.\nGaletti\u2019s response: \u201cIf they work here, they have boots.\u201d\nThrough a spokesperson, Galetti denied making these remarks.\n\u201cThe story of Beth is the story of [many] of the executives at Amazon,\u201d a former diversity employee told Recode. \u201cFor the most part, they haven\u2019t had to examine their privilege, so it\u2019s counter to their worldview to think about how people may be coming in at very real disadvantages.\u201d\nAnother problem, sources say, is Galetti\u2019s work experience. Amazon originally recruited Galetti, a logistics and technology executive, from FedEx in 2013 to take on an operations role at Amazon. But then Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s operations chief at the time, thought she would be a fit for a human resources leadership role despite her lack of HR experience, according to a new book, Amazon Unbound, by the journalist Brad Stone, which documents the transformation of Amazon and its founder over the past decade.\nIn 2016, Galetti ascended to the top HR role at Amazon as senior vice president of human resources and became the only woman on Jeff Bezos\u2019s senior leadership team. Sources say Galetti tends to focus on developing software products, such as Amazon\u2019s daily employee survey tool called Connections. Earlier this year, Amazon\u2019s human resources division was renamed as People Experience and Technology (PXT).\nA longtime Amazon HR manager told Recode that software tools have \u201cimproved dramatically\u201d under Galetti\u2019s leadership. Anderson, the Amazon spokesperson, noted that the company has 1.3 million employees globally and that developing internal HR software products is crucial, including for effectively doing DEI work.\n\u201cBeth is a brilliant operations professional and engineer,\u201d the longtime HR manager added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not surprising that these issues would be coming up under her because these aren\u2019t issues she prioritizes or has experience in.\u201d\nThe Amazon spokesperson said it\u2019s not uncommon for the company to put leaders in charge of an area that they don\u2019t have prior experience in. Other tech giants like Google and Facebook have similarly employed HR leaders who don\u2019t come from a human resources background.\nThe problem in this case, according to people who\u2019ve worked in diversity roles at Amazon, is that Galetti and her deputies have gone on to hire several key DEI employees who similarly don\u2019t have meaningful experience doing diversity work. Sources pointed out that the head of diversity efforts within Amazon Web Services was for years a white woman who had significant HR experience but no specific expertise in the field of diversity and inclusion. Multiple sources told Recode that they believe this leader didn\u2019t understand the basics of diversity, equity, and inclusion work.\n\u201cOne thing not called out is the number of white women who have senior leadership roles currently, and ... have held no D&I roles before,\u201d a former Amazon diversity employee said. \u201cSometimes, I know, [it\u2019s] someone ... passionate about the work. [But] that\u2019s never enough for Black women to just be passionate about something. We are in rooms with people who are in some ways gatekeeping the work that gets done. They don\u2019t have real experience but are seated at the table as a peer.\u201d\nAnd when Amazon finally hired an experienced diversity director in 2017 who\u2019d overseen diversity work for a Fortune 100 company, she lasted less than two years in the role. (She currently runs DEI work in an entirely different division at the company \u2014 a move that the company spokesperson said was voluntary.) Multiple people described Galetti\u2019s relationship with this director, who is a Black woman, as toxic and, at times, unprofessional. Sources who witnessed interactions between the two said that Galetti often talked over her in meetings and avoided eye contact with her. In one instance, sources say, Galetti called for a redo of internal training videos starring the diversity chief, with the HR leader saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want us to sound too trite.\u201d\nSome diversity employees also say it\u2019s telling that both this diversity head and her successor had \u201cdirector\u201d titles in Amazon\u2019s management hierarchy, and not a higher-level \u201cvice president\u201d label. Amazon has around 400 vice presidents at the company, but none focused on diversity work.\n\u201cShe has singular authority on her own to change that,\u201d a former Amazon diversity employee said of Galetti. Amazon leaders have told staff, and a spokesperson told Recode, that they are now searching for a VP-level executive to run diversity work at the company.\nDespite all this, it was a big moment in 2017 when a group of Amazon executives and diversity staff, including Galetti, met to craft and review a memo on diversity that would be the first of its kind ever presented to Bezos. Some staffers pushed for the memo to propose that Amazon could begin inviting warehouse employees, who are disproportionately Black and Latinx compared to corporate staff, to apply for a technical training program called the Amazon Technology Academy. The program was at the time only open to corporate employees. The idea was to offer warehouse workers a way to acquire skills they might need to make a jump to white-collar work, while helping improve racial diversity among the company\u2019s corporate staff.\nGaletti made her opinion of the proposal clear.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t McDonald\u2019s,\u201d the HR leader told the group, according to people familiar with the meeting discussion. \u201cYou don\u2019t go from making fries to corporate.\u201d\nWith Galetti\u2019s veto, the suggestion was nixed.\nThrough a spokesperson, Galetti denied making these remarks. The spokesperson added that Galetti is now the co-executive sponsor of the Amazon Technical Academy and a supporter of other company programs to \u201cupskill\u201d front-line employees, including one that has promised to spend $700 million to train 100,000 Amazon employees for new in-demand jobs by 2025. The Amazon Technical Academy began in 2017 but did not start accepting warehouse employees until its second cohort in 2019. The program recently graduated 77 employees, around 40 percent of whom previously held warehouse roles, according to the spokesperson.\nMore recently, Galetti\u2019s actions \u2014 more than her words \u2014 have angered employees focused on diversity work. In late 2020, around a dozen new people transferred internally to the global diversity team. But according to sources throughout Amazon, none of these employees had any previous experience in diversity work. They were employment lawyers and other staff focused on investigations and compliance.\nAnd when Amazon\u2019s former head of the global diversity team, Elizabeth Nieto, left the company in early 2021, Galetti replaced her, at least on an interim basis, with a longtime vice president in charge of a large technical team focused on recruiting. But the actual day-to-day management of the diversity team shifted to one of the employment lawyers who had just a few months earlier joined the diversity organization \u2014 she had no other prior DEI experience. (Amazon has two structures for diversity work at the company. The majority of diversity employees work within different business divisions like Amazon Web Services or Amazon Studios, while a smaller group of employees work on a central global diversity team under human resources and Galetti that\u2019s intended to work on company-wide initiatives versus division-specific ones.)\nSources told Recode that once the employment attorney took over the diversity team, she moved members of its research, analytics, and recruiting units to other divisions of the company. An internal memo announcing the restructuring said the departing employees would still be \u201cclosely tied\u201d to the central diversity team, but the shake-up was nonetheless a shock to DEI employees across Amazon.\nThen, just two days after Recode notified Amazon about the content of this story, the company announced yet another reshuffling: The employment lawyer who had been the day-to-day leader of the diversity team on an interim basis was now moving with her staff off the diversity team. The new employment lawyer is becoming Galetti\u2019s pseudo-chief of staff, according to sources \u2014 a role known inside Amazon as a technical adviser or \u201cshadow.\u201d With this change, the group\u2019s actual DEI experts would remain on the diversity team but begin reporting to a new temporary boss until a permanent vice president is hired to head up DEI work across Amazon.\nEven before this latest overhaul, around two dozen members of Amazon\u2019s central diversity team had either left the team or been pushed out over the past two years, according to sources. Today, the team has fewer than 10 employees, sources say.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion and then start dismantling the DEI team,\u201d a person who has worked in a diversity role at Amazon told Recode.\nThis shake-up has stunned employees across the company \u2014 especially because of the timing. As they were rolling out these changes, Galetti and other Amazon leaders have been expressing how much the company cares about recruiting a more diverse set of employees and executives, while also improving the experience at Amazon for folks from underrepresented backgrounds once they get in the door.\n\u201cWe are committed to fostering a culture in which inclusion is the norm for all Amazonians,\u201d Galetti wrote in a company blog post on April 14. \u201cI am grateful to the many employees who continue to share their experiences with me and other senior leaders. Tough feedback is always uncomfortable to hear, but their stories remind us that we have more work to do to achieve our goals. This is some of the most important work we have ever done, and we are committed to building a more inclusive and diverse Amazon for the long term.\u201d\nGaletti then listed 11 company-wide goals related to DEI work, including inspecting \u201cany statistically significant demographic differences\u201d in performance ratings given by managers and employee attrition, as well as the goal of retaining \u201cemployees at statistically similar rates across all demographics.\u201d Several other goals were focused specifically on Black employees and Black executives, including doubling the number of Black executives at the director and vice president levels for the second year in a row.\nBut some diversity employees pointed out how recently announced goals, like inspecting performance ratings and attrition rates for racial disparities, only came after Recode published its February investigation into racial issues at the company.\n\u201cNo matter how many people suffer, they always ignore it unless it appears to hurt their brand or threaten leadership,\u201d a current diversity employee told Recode.\nIt is true that Amazon has been making progress in increasing representation of employees of races that are typically underrepresented in the tech industry. Amazon US corporate employees in entry-level and middle-management positions who identify as Black and Latinx grew from 5.4 percent and 6.6 percent respectively in 2019 to 7.2 percent and 7.5 percent in 2020, according to recent data the company published. For context, about 13.4 percent of US residents identified as Black or African American in 2019, while 18.5 percent identified as Hispanic or Latino, according to the US Census Bureau.\nAn Amazon spokesperson pointed to company data that shows 26.5% of Amazon\u2019s entire US workforce identifies as Black or African American and 22.8% of that workforce identifies as Latinx; those percentages include warehouse and customer service workers in addition to corporate staff. Amazon\u2019s field and customer support workforce, which comprises the three lowest levels at the company and includes its warehouse workers, is disproportionately Black and Latinx compared to the US population \u2014 in 2020, 26.4 percent of these workers identified as Latinx and 31 percent identified as Black or African American.\nAnd some diversity employees called out drop-offs in racial representation as you go higher in Amazon\u2019s corporate ranks, saying that this shows Amazon\u2019s internal systems are still stacked against nonwhite and non-Asian employees.\nIn Amazon\u2019s \u201csenior leader\u201d ranks \u2014 which are \u201cdirector\u201d level and above in the company\u2019s hierarchy \u2014 Black and Latinx executives accounted for just 1.9 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in 2019. Those percentages jumped to 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, in 2020.\nAnderson, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company acknowledges it has more work to do but that it is making significant progress every year. And, of course, Amazon is far from alone in the technology industry in having more work to do in creating a corporate workforce that more closely resembles the racial makeup of the greater US population. Even so, some employees still don\u2019t trust that the company will focus on the right things when it comes to DEI work.\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m doing window-dressing and lying for Amazon or something,\u201d one current diversity employee said. \u201cAnd I think they actually think they are doing good diversity work. But they are overly focused on recruiting. They don\u2019t have [enough] focus internally on the employee experience, and they are not listening to their own employees.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s spokesperson said the company disagrees, citing new 2021 company goals like having similar retention rates for employees of all races, as well as internal programs focused on the employee experience, such as one-year mentoring initiatives focused on women from underrepresented backgrounds.\nDiversity employees who spoke to Recode also said Galetti and other leaders don\u2019t give them access to the data they say they need to identify problem areas and come up with sustainable ways to fix them. Recode previously reported that Amazon diversity employees who work outside of the HR department had confronted Galetti at an internal summit in early 2020 about the difficulty of not having access to detailed data about workforce demographics across different management levels.\nThen, after Recode first presented Amazon with leaked internal data in February that seemed to show racial disparities in employee performance ratings, Amazon began further restricting access to internal demographic data, according to numerous sources. Now, many diversity employees must ask certain colleagues who have access to pull information for them, or get sign-off for access from superiors.\nAnderson, the spokesperson, said the company agrees that data plays a crucial role in the work but that the specificity of access a given DEI professional has relates to their specific role. She maintained that all DEI professionals at Amazon have access to the data they need to do their job.\nBut several staffers focused on diversity work at the company disagree.\n\u201cFor those of us with experience, we know that data tells the story and is key to focusing on the right things,\u201d another diversity employee said. \u201cWe hope we are hitting home runs, but in most cases we are working off of anecdotes.\u201d\nFor all their criticisms of Galetti, current and former employees emphasized that they believe her leadership choices and priorities are a reflection of a corporate culture that\u2019s obsessed with customer satisfaction, but that has historically been less interested in the kind of empathy for employees that\u2019s necessary for sustained success in DEI work.\n\u201cI\u2019d say 40 percent of the impression that [Galetti] doesn\u2019t care about DEI comes from actions she chose,\u201d a former Amazon diversity employee told Recode. \u201cSixty percent is [that] she\u2019s a cog in the machine.\u201d\nSeveral of these people also assigned blame to members of Jeff Bezos\u2019s predominantly white male leadership team, who they believe have for years been complicit in ignoring signs of racial inequity inside the company. This leadership team consists of around 25 executives \u2014 but only four are women, and three of the women are white. None of the men are Black or Latino.\n\u201cThe S team [senior leadership] is so out of touch, and none of this affects them \u2014 so they can get away with not ever addressing [it],\u201d a former Amazon diversity professional told Recode.\nAnderson, Amazon\u2019s spokesperson, defended the company\u2019s top leaders, pointing out new biweekly meetings focused on Amazon\u2019s DEI efforts that the majority of them have been attending since June 2020. She said there are no other initiatives that top company leaders meet so regularly to discuss.\nSome employees also stressed that, increasingly, other companies are moving diversity work out of HR and giving chief diversity officers a direct line to a company\u2019s chief executive. A recent survey of 168 chief diversity officers found that nearly 40 percent report to a company\u2019s CEO, while just 17 percent report to the head of HR.\n\u201cDEI is emancipatory work and at times needs to challenge the company itself,\u201d a current Amazon employee told Recode. \u201cHR acts like the company\u2019s bodyguard and will jump in front of a bullet to save the company even if the company itself was the one holding the gun.\u201d\nOthers want to see more accountability when it comes to diversity, equity, and inclusion work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think broadly that senior leadership wants to do the wrong thing,\u201d an Amazon diversity employee told Recode. \u201cBut with things that are a business imperative, there are consequences. For [diversity and inclusion], that\u2019s not the case. If you don\u2019t meet the goal, no one is not being promoted because of that. The goals are more aspirational.\u201d\nSources also told Recode they believe HR is a problem for diversity work because sometimes members of the human resources department can perpetuate biases and commit microaggressions.\nOne source told Recode about a recent exchange surrounding a lawsuit that Charlotte Newman, a Black leader in Amazon\u2019s Web Services division, filed against the company and two of its executives in March, alleging gender and racial discrimination, as well sexual harassment and assault. After Newman appeared on a national morning news show to discuss her experiences and lawsuit, a white HR manager commented about Newman\u2019s appearance in an internal meeting. \u201cShe\u2019s well-spoken; she presents so well,\u201d the white HR leader said, according to someone familiar with the incident. The implication, it seemed to this source, was that both observations were for some reason a surprise to the HR manager.\nA source told Recode that in another incident, a different white Amazon HR leader \u201clost her shit\u201d when a diversity employee recommended that Asian employees could benefit from education on the idea of \u201callyship.\u201d The leader raised her voice and criticized the suggestion as absurd. The recommendation came after Black and Latinx employees gave feedback to diversity staff that they experience bias from some of their South Asian and East Asian colleagues. Asian employees are, by far, the largest nonwhite racial group in Amazon\u2019s US corporate workforce, comprising more than one-third of staff.\n\u201cAny other place, this could be a priority and something to figure out how we tackle,\u201d the source told Recode. \u201cWe would inspect for homogeneity of teams ... and say, \u2018Hey, your team is predominantly X, and you have X headcount, and here is what we strongly recommend.\u2019 Not at Amazon.\u201d\nAmazon works hard to foster a culture where inclusion is the norm, and these anecdotes do not reflect our values. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form, including the micro-aggressions that Black people experience all too often in their everyday lives. All employees are required to take inclusion training, and employees are encouraged to raise concerns to any member of management or through an anonymous ethics hotline with no risk of retaliation. When an incident is reported, we investigate and take proportionate action, up to and including termination. Any situation where even one of our employees is feeling excluded or unsupported is unacceptable.\nAcross the board, Amazon employees who work in diversity roles told Recode that the company is at an inflection point when it comes to this critical work. Several of the current Amazon employees who spoke to Recode said they decided to share their stories as a last resort.\n\u201cI want to stay,\u201d one of them said, noting how big of an impact Amazon can have because it\u2019s the second-largest private employer in the US and a model for many other companies, as well as a company whose products and services impact so many people.\nBut these same employees also reiterated a common belief: that big, uncomfortable change at Amazon often only comes as a result of press coverage or other external pressure.\n\u201cI have a group text with female colleagues and friends built over the years and we share all these articles,\u201d one longtime HR employee said, referencing investigative stories about Amazon\u2019s internal culture and labor practices. \u201cOur general perspective is, \u2018Thank God. We welcome the inspection in our organization.\u2019\u201d\nSome said they were holding out hope that new Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who takes over for Jeff Bezos on July 5, might make changes if he understands how defeated diversity employees at the company currently feel, and how hard it is for them to do their jobs effectively.\nBezos himself seemed to be grappling with Amazon\u2019s legacy as an employer when he published in April his final letter to shareholders as the company\u2019s chief executive. In the note, which came in the wake of a historic union drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, Bezos committed to Amazon becoming \u201cEarth\u2019s Best Employer\u201d in addition to his original vision of Earth\u2019s Most Customer-Centric Company.\nStill, other diversity employees were less than optimistic. Several of Recode\u2019s sources said they were looking for a way out of the company.\n\u201cPeople come into this work because they want to make a difference,\u201d a current Amazon employee said. \u201cYou get pulled by your heartstrings, [but] then get sucked into a hostile situation.\u201d\nMillions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

                    "value": "How should one narrate the life of a great writer? Joseph Frank\u2019s five-volume biography of Dostoevsky, now supplemented by his Lectures on Dostoevsky, revivified the form by situating the novelist within the ideological struggles of his day. The many fascinating primary sources about Dostoevsky\u2019s life inspired Thomas Marullo to experiment with a new kind of biography in his brilliant Fyodor Dostoevsky: A Life in Letters, Memoirs, and Criticism. (A third volume is still to come.) The novelist Alex Christofi was similarly inspired, and while his innovative biography, Dostoevsky in Love, occasionally intrigues, it ultimately offers little that\u2019s new. All three recognize the difficulty of distinguishing Dostoevsky\u2019s actual life from the legends about him.\nThe special importance Russians have traditionally assigned to literature has conferred on writers a mythic aura. Not surprisingly, the real and imagined lives of Pushkin, Griboedov, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Mandelstam, and others have prompted novelistic treatment by significant writers, from Yuri Tynyanov to J.M. Coetzee. As the Russian Formalist theoretician Boris Tomashevsky observed, widely shared legends shape readers\u2019 experience and so become \u201cliterary facts\u201d in themselves. Tomashevsky argued that scholars should therefore examine \u201chow the poet\u2019s biography operates in the reader\u2019s consciousness.\u201d Authors, eager to excite interest, \u201ccreate for themselves an artificial legendary biography composed of intentionally selected real and imaginary events,\u201d a process especially important during the Romantic period.\nThe romantic poet was his own hero. His life was poetry\u2026. The readers cried: \u201cAuthor! Author!\u201d\u2014but they were actually calling for the slender youth in a cloak, with a lyre in his hands and an enigmatic expression on his face.\nIn Russia this approach to writers\u2019 lives continued long after Romanticism and, indeed, has never ceased. As poets and novelists became the national conscience, or what Solzhenitsyn called a \u201csecond government,\u201d tradition required them not only to create great works but also to live appropriately high-minded lives. When the novelist Mikhail Sholokhov joined in the condemnation of dissident writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, and regretted that they had only been imprisoned rather than summarily executed, the editor and author Alexander Tvardovsky wrote in his diary that \u201cSholokhov is now a former writer.\u201d\nFew writers\u2019 biographies have excited more interest than Dostoevsky\u2019s, as the volumes under review suggest. Several incidents in his life seem like excerpts from his most fantastic tales. Most famous is the story of how, after being imprisoned from April to December 1849 for illegal political activity, Dostoevsky was condemned to death, led out with other prisoners to be shot, and offered last rites. The entire scene had been staged in advance\u2014coffins had been strewn about to make everything look more terrifying\u2014as part of the punishment. At the last possible moment, with the guns trained on the first group of condemned radicals, and Dostoevsky in the next group, the execution was called off. One of the prisoners went mad and never recovered his sanity; another wrote Crime and Punishment.\nDostoevsky, whose sentence was reduced to time in a Siberian prison camp followed by army service, made the most of this near escape. Prince Myshkin, the hero of The Idiot, three times imagines the thoughts of a man being led to execution. Time accelerates exponentially as the mind tries to cram decades into a few final minutes; looking at the crowd, the prisoner feels an infinite loneliness realizing that \u201cnot one of them is being executed, but I am to be executed\u201d; his attempts to distract himself fail as everything becomes a symbol of what he wants to forget. \u201cPerhaps there is some man who has been sentenced to death, exposed to this torture, and has then been told \u2018you can go!, you are pardoned,\u2019\u201d Myshkin wonders. \u201cPerhaps such a man could tell us\u201d what the experience is like. As every reader knew, and as Dostoevsky counted on their knowing, there was such a man, and he was telling us.\nThe Idiot also dramatizes another well-known fact: Dostoevsky\u2019s epilepsy. In one thrilling passage, Myshkin, just before an epileptic seizure, remembers in detail what the experience is like. Remarkably enough, it resembles the moments before execution: time accelerates to infinity until he understands \u201cthe extraordinary saying [in the Book of Revelation] that \u2018there shall be time no longer.\u2019\u201d Epilepsy differs from execution because it replaces the unfathomable horror of the condemned prisoner with an equally unimaginable bliss, which affords a mystical understanding of the very essence of existence. Just before he loses consciousness, Myshkin has time to say to himself, \u201cYes, for this one moment one might give one\u2019s whole life!\u201d Readers might presume that such experiences enabled insights no other writer could attain.\nAlmost as famous was Dostoevsky\u2019s addiction to gambling. Picture the scene: in 1867 he has hurried abroad with his bride to escape debtor\u2019s prison. They pawn their clothing but do not raise enough to pay their hotel bill or buy food. At last Dostoevsky receives an advance from his publisher but cannot resist the roulette table, where he loses it all. His novella The Gambler describes this addiction, which, like execution and epilepsy, offers the vertiginous thrill of a maximally intense moment\u2014in this case, because the next instant can make one either a millionaire or a beggar. When the novella\u2019s hero wins, he wastes the money, because what matters to him is the thrill.\nAfter Dostoevsky\u2019s death, more legends accumulated. Best known is the one included in Freud\u2019s \u201cDostoevsky and Parricide\u201d and elaborated by later biographers and critics. Relying on a document mentioning an unspecified tragic incident in Dostoevsky\u2019s life, Freud presumed that it must have been punishment by a tyrannical father for masturbation and the consequent onset of a nervous disease. When serfs murdered Dostoevsky\u2019s father\u2014as Dostoevsky\u2019s daughter Lyubov reported\u2014Dostoevsky, who in Freud\u2019s view must have desired his father\u2019s death, experienced intense guilt. The quasi death of epilepsy ensued as a self-inflicted punishment, and so the disease was not organic but \u201chysterical\u201d in origin. Freud speculated that when Dostoevsky was actually punished in Siberia, the substitute punishment of epilepsy must have temporarily ceased.\nAs Frank and Marullo demonstrate, everything about this widely accepted story is wrong. To begin with, the comment on which Freud based his analysis referred not to an event in early childhood, as he supposed, but to the death of Dostoevsky\u2019s father when Dostoevsky was seventeen. Since the author\u2019s own son Aleksey died of an epileptic seizure at the age of three, it seems likely that the father\u2019s epilepsy was inherited, and so organic rather than hysterical. Of course, as Frank observes, this argument would not have impressed Freud, who, as an unreconstructed Lamarckian, believed in the heritability of acquired characteristics.\na seizure would not have passed unnoticed by the hundred or so schoolmates with whom Dostoevsky lived on close terms\u2026. If Dostoevsky had had such an attack, he would have been dismissed immediately by the administrators of the institution.\nFar from ceasing in Siberia, Dostoevsky\u2019s epilepsy began there. By then, he was worrying about the cause of his various nervous ailments, including attacks that weakened his memory and produced the sensation that he was dying, and he wanted to return to Russia \u201cto see qualified doctors so as to know what my illness is.\u201d He wondered whether it might be the forerunner of epilepsy. If he still did not know he had epilepsy at this time, he could hardly have experienced his first seizure years before, as Freud had argued.\nBelieve it or not, Dostoevsky\u2019s first seizure occurred on his honeymoon in 1857, while he was still confined to Siberia. His first wife, Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva, who knew nothing of his previous ailments, suddenly heard his unearthly shriek and witnessed his convulsive movements, fainting, foaming at the mouth, and uncontrolled urination. Christofi skillfully evokes this scene, from which the marriage never recovered. He aptly quotes Dostoevsky\u2019s letter to his brother Mikhail about the event: \u201cIt scared my wife to death and filled me with sadness and depression. I begged [the doctor] to tell me the whole truth, on his honor. He advised me to beware of the new moon.\u201d\n\u201cDostoevsky now learned, for the first time, the true nature of his malady,\u201d Frank explains in his biography. Dostoevsky explained to Mikhail that\nthe doctor (well-informed and serious) told me, contrary to everything said previously by doctors, that I had genuine epilepsy, and that I could expect, in one of these seizures, to suffocate because of throat spasms.\nIn marrying I completely trusted the doctors who told me that [my symptoms] were only nervous seizures which would pass with a change in the circumstances of my life. If I had known as a fact that I had genuine epilepsy, I would not have married.\nThe first unmistakable attack, then, occurred precisely where, according to Freud, no attack should have happened. What\u2019s more, it has become abundantly clear that Dostoevsky\u2019s father, Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky, was not murdered. Frank\u2019s biography conveys the drama of discovering this fact. The text of his first volume accepts the murder as established, but a footnote reverses this judgment: \u201cAs the present volume goes to press,\u201d Frank reports, \u201csome important new material has come to light that casts considerable doubt on whether the death of Dr. Dostoevsky was a murder at all.\u201d In asserting that the death was murder, Dostoevsky\u2019s daughter Lyubov had relied on thirdhand information. What\u2019s more, her biography of her father is notoriously unreliable and makes readily identifiable errors.\nThe murder story took on a life of its own. Not only did it fit Freud\u2019s theory perfectly, it also included all sorts of lurid details. (In one version, the peasants crushed the doctor\u2019s genitals.) But the truth is almost as interesting. Two doctors independently ascertained that Dr. Dostoevsky, who had recently suffered a stroke, died suddenly from another one. Proponents of the murder theory assert that the peasants must have bribed the doctors, but where they could have secured sufficient funds for a bribe has never been explained.\nFor obvious reasons, the tsarist regime took the charge of serfs\u2019 killing their owners quite seriously, and when the rumor of murder reached them, authorities sent an investigating commission, which eventually exonerated the peasants. The rumor, the commission established, had been deliberately spread by one of Dr. Dostoevsky\u2019s neighbors for financial reasons. If the charge were accepted, the peasants would have been exiled to Siberia, which would have meant that Dr. Dostoevsky\u2019s land could be purchased for considerably less. Today, little doubt remains that this account is correct.\nMarullo\u2019s two new volumes supplement and question Frank\u2019s conclusions on this and other matters. Perfecting a technique he first used in his three-volume study of the novelist Ivan Bunin, Marullo weaves a narrative by bringing together diverse illuminating documents\u2014by Dostoevsky, his relatives, his friends, his first biographer, critics commenting on his work, other writers who knew him, Nicholas I, and the commission investigating Dr. Dostoevsky\u2019s death. Letters written while events were unfolding appear side by side with memoirs, some thoughtful and others mendacious, written decades later. Marullo includes \u201canything and everything they have said about Dostoevsky\u2014the truths and lies; the good, bad, and ugly; even the laughable and ludicrous.\u201d Assembling the thrilling facts and legends about Dostoevsky, Marullo has invented a new genre of biography, \u201ca portrait of the writer in a new and seminal way.\u201d Readers can not only form their own opinions about disputed events, but also trace the origins of various legends. The documents reflect a haze of rumors, plausible mistakes, shrewd guesses, and vindictive falsities that shaped Dostoevsky\u2019s reputation while he lived and the conclusions drawn by biographers and critics ever since.\nIn his introductions and extensive notes, Marullo corrects misstatements and argues with other scholars, including Frank. While Frank correctly contested most of the Freudian myth, Marullo argues, he still presumed that Dr. Dostoevsky was a tyrant and sadist guilty of \u201cmistreating the peasants abominably.\u201d As a result, Frank concluded that even if Dr. Dostoevsky had not been murdered, and even if his children never believed he had been, Dostoevsky may still have experienced intense guilt for his father\u2019s cruelty to serfs. Such a reaction would explain why Dostoevsky became obsessed with the evils of serfdom and joined a revolutionary organization, a decision that led to his imprisonment.\nAgainst this view, Marullo marshals evidence\u2014impressive, if not conclusive\u2014that Dr. Dostoevsky was an \u201cexemplary\u201d father, that he treated the peasants well, and that there is no reason to suppose Dostoevsky felt any guilt for his father\u2019s death. Future biographers will need to weigh Frank\u2019s and Marullo\u2019s competing arguments in light of whatever evidence is available to them.\nMarullo also adds to Frank\u2019s account of events leading to the moment Dostoevsky described as his happiest. After graduating from the school of military engineering\u2014where, according to a friend, \u201cthere was no student less capable of military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky\u201d\u2014he briefly worked for the drafting department of the St. Petersburg Engineering Corps. Dreaming of becoming a writer who would solve the mysteries of the soul, Dostoevsky worked inattentively and once submitted a design for a fortress that had no gates. When Tsar Nicholas I happened to see the drawing, he asked, \u201cWhat idiot drew this?\u201d The future author of The Idiot was allowed to resign.\nDostoevsky roomed with a friend from the engineering academy, the writer Dmitri Grigorovich, who had developed good connections with literary Petersburg. One night when Dostoevsky was out, Grigorovich borrowed the manuscript of Dostoevsky\u2019s first novel, Poor Folk, to show to the poet Nikolay Nekrasov. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to tell from the first ten pages\u201d whether it is any good, they agreed, and before they knew it, they had finished the whole work. \u201cThey both decided to see me at once,\u201d Dostoevsky recalled. \u201c\u2018Who cares if he\u2019s asleep,\u2019 they said, \u2018this is more important than sleep!\u2019\u201d Having just returned home when they arrived at 4 AM, Dostoevsky was overwhelmed as the two friends, \u201cspeaking hastily and with exclamations,\u201d told him of their decision to share the manuscript with the most influential critic of the day, Vissarion Belinsky. \u201cA new Gogol has appeared!\u201d Nekrasov told Belinsky, who replied, \u201cYou find Gogols springing up like mushrooms.\u201d\nWhen Nekrasov dropped in on Belinsky the following evening, he had already read Poor Folk and demanded to meet Dostoevsky, who was sure the severe critic would tear his novel apart. But Belinsky could not have been more enthusiastic. \u201cDo you, your very self, realize what it is you have written?\u201d he kept repeating. \u201cHave you yourself comprehended all the terrible truth you have shown to us?\u201d To explain his lack of enthusiasm over some of Dostoevsky\u2019s subsequent works, critics have wrongly argued that Belinsky, whom the Soviets regarded as a forerunner of socialist-realist aesthetics, misread Poor Folk as social criticism rather than psychology. But what Belinsky grasped is that Dostoevsky revealed how economic deprivation is only the beginning of poverty\u2019s ills. Still worse is the psychological harm of losing one\u2019s self-respect. Belinsky especially praised the passages in which, he told Dostoevsky, \u201cthis wretched clerk of yours\u2026from humility\u2026does not even dare to acknowledge his own wretchedness\u2026or claim even the right to his own unhappiness.\u201d\n\u201cCherish your gift, remain faithful to it, and be a great writer!\u201d Belinsky advised. This was the moment Dostoevsky deemed his happiest. But it did not last. The extraordinary success of Poor Folk, Marullo explains, \u201cso inflated the writer\u2019s being that he lost contact\u2026with reality,\u201d a judgment with which Dostoevsky, when recalling this period of his life, largely concurred. \u201cFor two years\u2026I was sick with a strange disease, a moral one,\u201d he explained. \u201cI fell into hypochondria. There was even a time when I lost my reason. I was extremely irritable, impressionable\u2026and capable of distorting the most ordinary facts.\u201d\nOther writers and critics responded to Dostoevsky\u2019s newfound self-importance with shocking cruelty. Turgenev, who became Dostoevsky\u2019s lifelong enemy, deliberately provoked the irritable young man into saying absurdities and then circulated them. \u201cWell, you are one to talk!\u201d Belinsky rebuked Turgenev. \u201cYou pick on a sick individual, you egg him on as if you yourself do not see that he is irritated and does not understand what he is saying.\u201d Turgenev, Nekrasov, and the critic Ivan Panaev concocted the story that Dostoevsky demanded that a literary anthology place Poor Folk at the end, the most striking position, and surround it with a border indicating its superior status. Their satiric poem \u201cA Greeting from Belinsky to Dostoevsky\u201d called the young author \u201ca new pimple on literature\u2019s nose\u201d and ended with \u201cBelinsky\u201d enthusing, \u201cI will surround you with a border/And put you at the end.\u201d Marullo includes a translation of the poem and commentaries on Poor Folk. He also provides generous extracts from Nekrasov\u2019s satire The Stone Heart (also called How Great I Am!), which makes fun of both Belinsky and Dostoevsky.\nIn his classic biography of Alexander Pope, Maynard Mack assumed the task of presenting the irascible poet in the best possible light. \u201cIf the results of the effort in my case are dismissed as special pleading, so be it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are few poets who cannot use an advocate.\u201d Scholars, however, are not defense attorneys; they owe their primary allegiance not to the poet but to the truth. Remarkably, neither Frank nor Marullo whitewashes Dostoevsky\u2019s unattractive sides. For those dealing with the last years of Dostoevsky\u2019s life, a crucial test of a biographer\u2019s intellectual honesty is the terrible anti-Semitism that then possessed him.*\nOn this issue, Christofi, like many others, falls short. He minimizes Dostoevsky\u2019s anti-Semitic outbursts as \u201cof their time. Like his beloved Dickens, he was\u2026too ready to found his edifices on stereotypes\u2026. We must remember that, for many years, anti-Semitism was official policy in Russia.\u201d These comments paint a wholly false picture. Dostoevsky\u2019s diatribes against the Jews were extreme even for his day, and even by Russian standards, which is saying a lot. \u201cWhat if it weren\u2019t the Jews who numbered three million in Russia but the Russians; and what if there were eighty million Jews?\u201d Dostoevsky asked.\nNo wonder Nazis and genocidal Russian nationalists made use of these comments.\nDostoevsky had once argued for Jewish rights, and always called for compassion for sufferers, so these comments have startled his admirers. Most studies ignore them and the work in which they occur, his one-person periodical, A Writer\u2019s Diary, which he published monthly in 1876 and 1877. As if he were ideologically possessed, like the fanatics in his novel The Demons, he came to believe for about eighteen months that he had discovered the key to history, which enabled him to predict, with no hesitation, that the apocalypse would occur within months. Apocalyptic mythology often presents the Antichrist as a Jew who will lead his adherents in a final battle with true Christians, and these ideas seem to have fueled Dostoevsky\u2019s anti-Semitism. When history failed to end, Dostoevsky suspended A Writer\u2019s Diary. His last novel, The Brothers Karamazov, represents an attempt to rethink the ideas leading to such colossal errors.\nChristofi, a novelist, presents his unconventional narrative of Dostoevsky\u2019s life as accurate. Yet he takes extraordinary liberties. The book consists of three types of statements. Direct quotations from the sources are footnoted and presented accurately. Narrative exposition relies on \u201ctrusted scholars\u201d but does not indicate the sources for particular facts. It is the third type of material, presented in italics, that involves \u201cartistic license.\u201d Christofi includes passages from Dostoevsky\u2019s writings as if they were direct comments on incidents in his own life. The tortured ruminations of his characters become the author\u2019s thoughts about himself.\n\u201cWhen authors conceive fiction,\u201d Christofi explains, \u201cthey often shear memories off from their context to use them as the building blocks of their new world. It is a kind of willful source amnesia.\u201d Christofi reverses this process so that he can \u201cre-attribute many of the memories and sense impressions that litter his fiction\u201d and apply them once again to Dostoevsky. But not all processes are reversible. An egg breaks, but the shards and liquid cannot be reassembled into an egg. And even if passages from novels reflect some real experience, why must they pertain to the author rather than to other people he knew? For that matter, why could they not, as Frank suggests in his lectures, magnify a barely discernible fact in order to examine its implications?\nHowever dubious the method, the result is what counts. Does Christofi\u2019s narrative help us \u201cto understand how people thought\u2026and to represent that thought faithfully so that others might know themselves better,\u201d as he suggests? The reader will look in vain for anything beyond superficial, even mistaken, observations. For example, Christofi claims that Dostoevsky wrote \u201cso much\u201d of The Idiot with the powerful final scene \u201cin mind,\u201d but we know from Dostoevsky\u2019s letters and notebooks that, desperate for money, he began publishing the first serialized parts of this novel without a clue as to its overall plot. The last scene did not occur to him until he was already halfway through the third of four parts, and even after that he continued to consider alternative endings.\nIn her foreword to the present collection of the lectures Frank delivered at Stanford after his retirement from Princeton, Robin Feuer Miller\u2014long one of Dostoevsky\u2019s subtlest interpreters\u2014observes that Frank \u201cmade the genre of biography new again, helping to ignite our general fascination with cultural history.\u201d In chapters on Poor Folk, The Double, The House of the Dead, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and The Brothers Karamazov, Frank distills his multivolume biography\u2019s provocative and superbly argued readings. In one of his lectures, he addresses the criticism that \u201cin focusing as much as I do on the social-cultural context, I reduce [Dostoevsky\u2019s] novels to being a reflection of the limited issues and questions of his own day.\u201d \u201cThere is something to be said for this point of view,\u201d Frank observes, but there is also a danger in reading our own social and political concerns into them. When we do, the novels can no longer teach us anything we don\u2019t already know.\nIt is also a mistake to read Dostoevsky\u2019s works using \u201cthe most general psychological and philosophical categories,\u201d such as \u201cthe eternal conflict in Western culture between love and justice,\u201d because the novels\u2019 greatness arises from the specifics of time and place that shed light on those questions as no generalities ever could. The best approach, in Frank\u2019s view, is first to locate Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction and ideas within his immediate concerns, and only then proceed, from the ground up rather than from generalities down, to consider their broader implications.\nThese lectures do that especially well. Particularly impressive is Frank\u2019s thesis that the experience of the mock execution left Dostoevsky with a completely different view of time and ethics, which Frank calls \u201ceschatological [apocalyptic] apprehension.\u201d Dostoevsky concluded, he says, that \u201cevery instant takes on a supreme value,\u201d and \u201ceach moment of the present is when a decisive choice has to be made.\u201d That is why Dostoevsky offers so many brilliant descriptions of the agonies of choice at critical moments. What matters most, in his view, is what we can do for another person right in front of us right now. Most essential, as Frank puts it, \u201cis action at every moment, at this very instant, as if time were about to stop and the world would come to an end.\u201d This way of looking at things, which Albert Schweitzer called \u201cinterim ethics,\u201d creates an especially urgent sense of compassion, but it also, I think, entails dangers, as Dostoevsky\u2019s susceptibility to literal apocalypticism demonstrates.\nReviewing Dostoevsky\u2019s second work, The Double, Belinsky observed that the young writer had demonstrated \u201cthe ability, so to speak, of migrating into the skin of another, a being completely different from himself.\u201d One cannot expect a literary biographer to migrate into the skin of an author the way great novelists do with their characters, but one can hope to understand, if not to actually experience, how the writer viewed the world. Frank accomplishes that, and Marullo gives us the material to do so for ourselves.\nThe brief, dashing life of Alexander Griboedov, who wrote the most-performed play in the Russian repertory, married a princess, and died during a bloody uprising in Persia.\nA new translation captures the oddity of Russia\u2019s most baffling comic writer.\nThe brief, dashing life of Alexander Griboedov, who wrote the most-performed play in the Russian repertory, married a princess, and died during a bloody uprising in Persia.\nA new translation captures the oddity of Russia\u2019s most baffling comic writer.\nGary Saul Morson is the Lawrence B.

Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more The following is a computer generated transcript and may contain some errors. Interview with TrimTabs' Bob Shea, CEO and CIO  Read More\nThe greatest long-term investments are those capable of performing well under opposing inflationary and deflationary economic forces. Today\u2019s abundance of macro, fundamental and technical reasons to be a gold investor have never been greater. The ongoing monetary and fiscal disorder in the global economy underpins the onset of a secular bull market in precious metals.\nFor us, there is no doubt that the Fed is cornered into choosing between only two destructive outcomes. On one side, it could decide to continue expanding its balance sheet to ensure subdued interest rates at the cost of setting off an inflationary problem. Or, it could take the deflationary route by reversing its unprecedently loose monetary policy, due to overheating economic conditions, resulting in a reckoning moment for financial assets from record valuations.\nWe weight a much higher probability that the inflationary backdrop will take place in the next few years, accompanied by a low economic growth environment (i.e., a stagflation). However, for now, let us consider the opposite course as a way of understanding the likely implications that investors may face.\nThe secular decline in money velocity is the key factor that feeds into the deflationary thesis. The Japanese economy is a great case study for this. While the Bank of Japan grew its balance sheet from 21% to 135% of its nominal GDP since 2000, the average annual increase in the country\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) was a mere 0.1%. Wages and salary growth remained muted under an aging population, which is still a problem today. Also, the technological advancements we saw over those years tempered the price increases in consumer goods and services.\nWhen money velocity falls, the private sector\u2019s willingness to hoard money, rather than spend it, is what tends to escalate deflationary forces in an economy. To add to this problem, near zero interest rate policies also cause financial institutions to become reluctant to lend capital to private institutions. We are seeing clear signs of that today. Commercial and industrial loans are down 16% from a year ago, the largest annual decline since the global financial crisis.\nNonetheless, like any other well-formed macro view, one should never rely on just one analog. There were plenty of examples in history of other economies that went through similar secular downward trends in money velocity but also faced inflationary problems. Turkey and Brazil would be great examples. Both economies suffered from significant currency devaluations while also experiencing the pressure of a rising consumer price environment.\nSome folks would argue that using these two countries as a counter argument for the deflationary thesis would be rather inappropriate. To be fair, we do not disagree. The size of these economies, their high levels of dollar denominated debt, or even the fact that both do not possess reserve currency status certainly are important considerations. However, ignoring today\u2019s vast list of inflationary drivers running at all cylinders also seems, to say the least, quite irresponsible:\nAlso, to address the issue more directly, the rate of change of US money velocity has begun to turn up after such a steep decline. Sure, it is still early to call the bottom, but it has indeed been moving towards the inflationary direction for the last 3 quarters.\nWhat concerns us the most is the fact that policy makers have become exceptionally complacent when it comes to believing that today\u2019s record monetary and fiscal stimulus will not translate into longer lasting inflation. We happen to be on the other side of that bet. It is appalling how a Fed member with an inflation forecast of 2.5% for the end of 2022 is now considered hawkish these days.\nWhat if we told you that the only transitory move we likely had was in the recent selloff in commodity prices? We think the hoarding of tangible assets by investors is just getting started.\nIt is a striking contradiction that the Fed decided to pivot the market narrative to its openness to tapering, though not raising interest rates until 2023. Meanwhile, it just reported that it added the largest amount of assets to its balance sheet in over a year. Nearly $200 billion in the last 4 weeks. Per their own statement:\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals.\u201d\nIt looks like the \u201cat least\u201d part came in handy this time around. It was the opposite of a taper. If we could use the perfect analogy to describe their message for raising interest rates into plain words, it would be the \u201cwe are debating if we should start a diet 2 years from now\u201d.\nThose assuming falling nominal yields indicate that inflation is transitory either have no clue that the Fed is buying $80 billion of Treasuries a month, or they just choose to ignore it. More importantly, the fact that nominal yields rose recently in the face of larger purchases of Treasuries by the Fed tells you why policy makers are truly trapped.\nThe recent growth in US government debt relative to economic growth has been astonishing. To put this into perspective, since January 2020, real GDP grew by $114 billion. Meanwhile, during the same time, government debt increased 43x that amount. This was perhaps the most unproductive use of capital that we have seen in history.\nThe last time real yields reached such low levels was in the 1970s when policy makers called for a war on inflation. Today, they are welcoming it. It\u2019s the most bullish macro set up for precious metals in over 50 years.\nImagine calling commodities the peak of a bubble today. Well, there are plenty of investors in that camp. We think it is important to zoom out and look at the profusion of reasons to own tangible assets that we showed above. In an environment of rising inflation, where most financial assets are at record valuations and yield less than inflation expectations, commodities and natural resource stocks offer strong value properties and near-term high growth tailwinds.\nEnergy, base metals, and agricultural commodities have led the latest rush we saw towards commodities. Therefore, the S&P GSCI Equal Weighted Commodity Sector index is now completely diverging from silver prices. We think there is a catch-up trade for precious metals that has been consolidating since August 2020.\nWe challenge investors to find an industry other than gold and silver miners with triple digit free-cash-flow growth, insanely cheap valuations, a strong balance sheet, profitability on the rise, and, on top of it, that is now historically oversold.\nThe precious metals industry is also on track to report six straight profitable quarters for the first time in history. If we look at the top 50 miners by market cap in the US and Canadian exchanges, the median free-cash-flow yield is at its highest level in 26 years.\nWe are also seeing unprecedented amounts of capital flowing into silver ETFs. It is happening across senior and junior silver miners and even tradable instruments that solely track silver prices. For instance, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) assets are near record levels while the ETF price remains 47% lower than its prior peak.\nThe Fed talked inflation expectations down in June with its \u201cinflation is transitory\u201d campaign and hawkish Fed meeting. It was a one-two punch for gold and other commodities in the short run that should prove all bark and no bite. We believe it is a gift that has created a great entry point today, and that precious metals prices are poised to be reversing back up post-haste.\nThe propaganda campaign also caused a countertrend move in the growth-to-value rotation, a shift that is still in its early innings in our analysis. Such counter trend moves are likely to prove short-lived, as they have little support from the preponderance of fundamental and macro data.\nIndeed, inflation is a much bigger problem than is being acknowledged by policy makers and their statisticians. Home buyers expect rents to be up 7%, according to a recent Fannie Mae survey, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that Owner\u2019s Equivalent Rent is up only 2.1%. Furthermore, the BLS has the audacity to make OER the largest component of the Consumer Price Index giving it a 24% weight.\nIn the meantime, actual home price inflation is running at an insane 23.6% annualized rate. Our government\u2019s CPI statistics are a disgrace.\nBeing long precious metals is our highest conviction theme at Crescat today. Our macro models indicate that it is very early in a new secular bull market for gold and silver. We have laid out many of the reasons for this thesis above and in our recent research letters. Thus, our activist precious metals portfolio is currently deliberately our largest positioning firmwide and is an important sleeve of our global macro and long/short funds. Our precious metals hedge fund and SMA are dedicated exclusively to this theme. It is important to understand that Crescat is a hedge fund focused firm. However, we also offer SMA strategies that are oriented toward investors who do not yet qualify for our funds. The SMA accounts do not participate in the PIPEs (private placements in public securities) and pre-IPO investments, nor receive warrants, important perks inside our hedge fund strategies. Our precious metals SMA has done exceptionally well since inception by outperforming the benchmark Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index. Our precious metals hedge fund, which was launched more than a year later, has significantly outperformed both the SMA and the benchmark since its inception.\nOur global macro and long/short equity hedge funds have other active themes besides precious metals, including a significant short position in overvalued equities. Our global macro fund is Crescat\u2019s most comprehensive strategy and can trade any asset class globally. In addition to the themes mentioned above, the global macro fund has a China currency devaluation theme. It has taken a lower profile in our risk budget over the past year, but the Chinese risks and macro imbalances have only become more acute, so we remain committed to this important tail risk theme.\nBecause it is a such a large position across the firm today, the rest of this letter will focus on the composition of our activist gold and silver portfolio within the precious metals fund.\nWe are predominantly focused on companies and projects where gold or silver is the primary metal, but we are also interested in base metal deposits where precious metals are a substantial byproduct to enhance the overall grade and profitability.\nBecause of the industry-wide underinvestment in exploration and development over the last decade in precious metals mining, the majors have not been replacing their reserves and are facing a production cliff beginning in just four years. While these companies are enjoying strong free cash flow today, as we showed above. It is largely a result of their ultra conservative spending. They will soon have little choice but to acquire new deposits from a select group of exploration focused companies if they want to continue their growth. These exploration-based companies are what we are focused on at Crescat today. However, we are not interested in investing in the companies with the leftover low-grade deposits of the last exploration cycle. We have been busy funding the exploration and discovery of a new generation of high-grade gold and silver deposits. These are the projects that the majors and mid-tiers will be most compelled to buy. We believe they will be doing so at a substantial premium to their current valuation in our portfolio today. But acquisition is not our only exit strategy. On the sheer substance of our portfolio companies\u2019 existing and expected discoveries, we believe our activist companies have the ability, alone or in combination with each other, to become mid-tier and major producers in their own right to take on today\u2019s industry heavyweights. As such, we are very excited about the opportunity to deploy substantial capital now and over the intermediate term in what believe is a new secular bull market for precious metals.\nThe vast majority of our companies have their primary projects in top 20 jurisdictions for mining industry investment attractiveness as ranked by the Fraser Institute 2020 Survey including: Nevada, Arizona, Saskatchewan, Western Australia, Alaska, Quebec, South Australia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Idaho, Finland, Queensland, British Columbia, Yukon, and Ontario. We avoid Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. We show our companies by portfolio exposure based on the jurisdiction of their primary project in the map below.\nWe believe our portfolio companies have more than six times the active greenfield gold exploration drilling than industry leaders Newmont and Barrick combined. The map below shows the number of drills that our portfolio companies expect to have active in 2021 by geography of their primary project.\nWe have regularly scheduled meetings twice a week to review the entire portfolio with Quinton Hennigh, PhD, Crescat\u2019s Geologic and Technical Advisor and the rest of the investment team to review the entire portfolio and update the scoring. Quinton\u2019s industry experience, expertise, and involvement in making large and high-grade gold discoveries is second to none. We maintain extensive ongoing notes on each of our portfolio companies. Between Quinton, Tavi, and Kevin, we have ongoing meetings (3 to 10 per day) with existing and prospective companies\u2019 management and technical personnel. Quinton takes most of the initial screening meetings personally, and Kevin and Tavi have follow up meetings before handling the deal structuring and negotiation. Quinton and the whole team continue to engage with the geologists and management on exploration and drilling plans.\nWe are grateful to Bloomberg for recognizing two of Crescat\u2019s hedge funds for their strong performance in May.\nIn our analysis, the Fed\u2019s \u201cinflation is transitory\u201d campaign in June was carefully scripted rhetoric with little substance to back it up. The Fed\u2019s action over the same four-week time of $198 billion in asset purchases was a direct contradiction to its message. It was the exact opposite of the threatened taper. It should be very concerning to investors at large that it was the Fed\u2019s increased pace of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases in June that had the effect of driving interest rates down, not the idea that the market was believing its \u201cdon\u2019t worry about inflation\u201d story.\nScore one for the Fed in June. They won. Not bad for an organization that is trapped and ultimately has no choice but to embrace two economic evils: real world inflation and deflation of financial assets. No doubt they won in the short run by beating those who were duped into selling their gold and silver holdings or into buying bonds and large cap growth stocks at today\u2019s insane valuations.\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold & Silver Index is down 13.3% in June MTD while spot gold is down 6.4% and spot silver down 6.8%. Crescat\u2019s activist precious metals hedge fund is down approximately 4% net MTD in comparison. Our global macro and long/short hedge funds are down slightly more given their equity short positions in a stock market that is remarkably still hitting new all-time highs. Rest assured, we not giving up on our short exposure in those two funds.

Republican senators publicly accepted that his comment linking the two bills \u2014 \u201cIf this is the only thing that comes to me, I\u2019m not signing it\u201d \u2014 was a flub. But the President still gave other GOP opponents an opening to portray the two measures as a deceptive two-step\u2026. The parallel tracks of the two bills add up to a complicated formula constructed in order to get a 60-vote majority in the 50-50 Senate for infrastructure while offering an incentive to those Democrats who think the deal is far too small. It reflects the fact that the political balance in Washington is too narrow for Biden to guarantee passing big bills. He faces trouble from his right among Republicans and moderate Democrats in the Senate and from the left of his own party, which has the capacity to rupture a narrow House majority. everyone understands the President will seek to pass a second bill \u2014 the White House has mentioned a figure of $4 trillion \u2014 containing much of the \u201chuman infrastructure\u201d social spending taken out of the narrower deal to appease Republicans.\u201d \u2022\u00a0Maybe if we moved the Pentagon to Charleston, WV?\nUPDATE \u201cWhite House prepping big assault on monopolies\u201d [Politico]. \u201cThe White House is crafting an executive order aimed at promoting competition throughout the U.S. economy, a move aimed at lessening the stranglehold of dominant players in industries ranging from banking and agriculture to shipping and air travel, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The order, which could be issued as soon as this week, fits in with a growing theme for President Joe Biden, who has elated progressives by appointing advocates of tougher antitrust enforcement to top jobs at the White House and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission. It would also mark a big shift in the government\u2019s approach to the concerns about monopolies that have swelled during the 21st century: No longer content to just enforce antitrust laws, the Biden administration would use federal power to actively spark competition in a vast array of businesses. The order isn\u2019t final and hasn\u2019t yet been presented to Biden, the people said. The White House said Monday that the president has made no decisions about signing such an order.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Defense Industry Is A Corrupt, Incompetent Mess\u201d [The American Conservative]. \u201cThe Lockheed Corporation, predecessor to the F-35\u2019s embattled designer Lockheed Martin, was responsible for building some of the most impressive aircraft in history. Lockheed\u2019s Advanced Development Projects, nicknamed \u201cSkunk Works\u201d as a reference to a 1940s comic strip, built aircraft that played a pivotal role in countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The F-80 Shooting Star was the first jet fighter to shoot down another jet, a Soviet MiG-15 fighter over Korea. The ultra-lightweight U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew high over Soviet territory, taking photographs of military installations from up to 80,000 feet and evading early surface-to-air missiles. The A-12 and SR-71 spy planes added extreme speed to extreme altitude, blazing past Soviet air defenses at up to three times the speed of sound. Skunk Works was effective because its top-notch engineers were allowed to operate with relative freedom from Lockheed\u2019s bureaucracy and management constraints, and even encouraged to bypass standard procedures when necessary. Today, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find that same can-do American spirit at Lockheed Martin. According to a former employee, the F-35 project has become as much a jobs program as a national defense priority. And the Project On Government Oversight has extensively reported on Lockheed Martin\u2019s incompetence and corruption throughout the two-decade-long program. If Lockheed Martin were a serious organization as it was during the Cold War, it wouldn\u2019t operate like this. And if the Department of Defense were run by serious people, it wouldn\u2019t allow defense contractors to engage in fraud, waste, and abuse on this scale. Lockheed Martin might be drawing the most fire right now over the F-35, but the company\u2019s behavior is emblematic of a defense establishment with severely distorted priorities. So it\u2019s time to put it all on the chopping block.\u201d\n\u201cTransgender student wins bathroom battle after Supreme Court rejects school board appeal\u201d [ABC]. \u201cA transgender man from Virginia has won a years-long legal battle against his former high school over its refusal to let him use boys bathrooms when he was a student. The U.S. Supreme Court Monday rejected the Glouchester County School Board\u2019s appeal of a lower court decision that found its transgender bathroom ban is unconstitutional\u2026. \u2018The decision to deny certorari affirms that transgender students are protected by Title IX,\u2019 said Alphonso David, Human Rights Campaign President. \u2018Everyone has the right to high-quality, public education without the fear of being discriminated against simply for being brave enough to show up as you truly are.

The Whoring 20s, Shot Girl Summer, the smell of meat and lotion. A bus passed by yesterday, its side painted with an advert encouraging passersby to \u201cvax, wax and relax\u201d. The new sexual revolution is here, and all it took was a deadly pandemic and a year indoors. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s coming, look, there!\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a good summer. It\u2019s going to be an interesting summer, with moments of pain, and the sometimes bastard thoughts that make us human. It\u2019s going to be hot, but in ways that occasionally burn, a humid bewildering kind of heat. It\u2019s going to be the summer of complicated, radical, ageing, queered, distanced, unlikely love. Welcome, enjoy, and please wash your hands.\u201d \u2022\u00a0Nice touch, reinforcing fomite transmission at the end. Well played. In any case, this is the subtext of almost everything \u201cwe\u201d are reading about this coming summer.

Carpe diem\u2026.\n\u201cThe Mayor\u2019s Race Isn\u2019t (Quite) Decided Yet\u201d [New York Magazine]. From last week, but the voter breakdown is interesting: \u201cthis election is very much Adams\u2019s race to lose. Wiley\u2019s support came largely from gentrifying areas of Queens and Brooklyn, her best precincts running in nearly a straight line down the waterfront from Astoria to Red Hook, but she also did well in northern Manhattan, places where Adams also ran strong. Many voters in those areas who picked Wiley as their No. 1 choice very likely chose Adams as their No. 2. The Garcia vote is more distinct. She dominated in Manhattan below 96th Street and picked up support in conservative white ethnic areas in outer Queens and outer Brooklyn and on parts of Staten Island. Her alliance with Andrew Yang over the last several days of the race, in which they campaigned across the city and passed out literature with both of them on it, will surely help her. Yang got just under 12 percent of the vote. With his fervent base of support following his cues, she is expected to pick up more than two-thirds of his vote, which would close the gap with Adams significantly.\u201d\nUPDATE \u201cThe Two Paths of Political Strife\u201d [Ross Barkan, Political Currents]. \u201cThe City Council could very well be a tumult next year. At least two Democratic Socialists of America members won their races outright and two others have a chance of winning in RCV. Even if DSA is limited to two Democrats, there will be many DSA adjacent members entering the body, with unapologetically left politics. The eventual winners of the races for seats held by Margaret Chin, Robert Cornegy, Jimmy Van Bramer, Darma Diaz, Karen Koslowitz, Brad Lander, Fernando Cabrera, and Eric Ulrich could all have successors with politics to the left of them. Progressive seats are being replaced by members with similar views. This bloc will be very potent in the next Council, especially since outer borough Democratic machines will likely lack the power to pick another speaker. At the same time, the moderate wing is bound to get louder\u2014if not bigger, too. \u2026. Imagine all of this\u2014new leftists holding citywide posts and chairing Council committees\u2014with someone as incendiary as Eric Adams in City Hall. If Adams is there, he will have won with his own formidable coalition, and be ready to do the bidding of the powerful real estate developers and financiers who will want a return on their investment.\u201d \u2022 I confess that Yang\u2019s entry anesthetized me to this race, which was far more interesting than I thought. (It baffled me that Yang would seek the office, even as a springboard to national office, which didn\u2019t work for Giuiliani or Diblasio or anyone else.)\nManufacturing: \u201cUnited States Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index\u201d [Trading Economics]. \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u2019 general business activity index for manufacturing in Texas decreased by 3.8 points from the previous month to 31.1 in June 2021, moving further away from April\u2019s near three-year high of 37.3 but notably higher than its series average of 2.8 and indicative of greater activity. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose 13.7 points to 29.4, reflecting strong output expansion.\u201d\nHousing: \u201cHigh Housing Valuations Move Inland\u201d [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]. \u201cIn the current housing boom, three of the five divisions with average housing valuations above the national average are inland\u2014namely, the Mountain, West North Central and West South Central divisions. Even more striking, average housing valuations in all five inland divisions are higher now relative to the national average than they were at the peak of the previous housing boom. Conversely, average housing valuations in all four coastal divisions are lower now relative to the national average than they were at the previous boom\u2019s peak. Thus, compared to last time, the housing boom has moved inland.\u201d\nManufacturing: \u201cCiting a serious flight test incident and lack of design maturity, FAA slows Boeing 777X certification\u201d [Seattle Times]. \u201cThe FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an \u2018uncommanded pitch event\u2019 \u2014 meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots. Boeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day. The letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements. And he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet\u2019s flight controls. \u2018The aircraft is not yet ready,\u2019 Won wrote. \u2018The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.\u2018 An FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now \u2018the subject of a lot of attention\u2019 at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.\u201d \u2022 \u201cNow.\u201d Only now?\nThe Bezzle: \u201cMichelin-starred restaurants touted this caviar as the best in local, sustainable products. But it wasn\u2019t what it seemed\u201d [San Francisco Chronicle]. \u201cFor years, chefs at some of the Bay Area\u2019s most lauded three-Michelin-starred restaurants have proudly worked with a celebrated seafood farm just outside Sacramento called Passmore. They\u2019ve plated the ranch\u2019s caviar atop delicate egg custard and decorated its smoked sturgeon with wild strawberries for customers who pay more than $300 for the privilege of eating the best \u2014 including what they thought was hand-raised, sustainable product from Passmore. But now, some chefs are severing ties with the farm as its founder, Michael Passmore, tries to explain why much of the fish he sells isn\u2019t actually raised on the farm \u2014 and that Passmore hasn\u2019t produced any caviar in more than two years. Instead, the company has been buying the prized cured sturgeon roe from countries like France and China and repackaging it as its own\u2026.. The revelations are the latest episode in a series of high-profile incidents in the food and restaurant industry involving businesses sourcing ingredients that don\u2019t align with their farm-to-table missions. This year, the New York Times reported that famed Pacific Northwest restaurant Willows Inn routinely bought produce from supermarkets that staff told diners was grown on the restaurant\u2019s own farm. (The chef denied the allegations.) In May, Bay Area-born sustainable meat company Belcampo admitted to mislabeling some meats as Belcampo-raised products when, in fact, they were purchased elsewhere. Perhaps most explosive was a monthslong investigation by the Tampa Bay (Fla.) Times in 2016 that found many popular farm-to-table restaurants weren\u2019t working with local farms at all.\u201d \u2022 Fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud. If there were no newspapers, we could eat in blissful ignorance!\nThe Bezzle: \u201cU.K. Financial Regulator Bars Crypto Exchange Binance Markets\u201d [Bloomberg]. \u201cThe U.K.\u2019s financial watchdog just took one of the most significant regulatory moves to date against a crytocurrency exchange as global scrutiny of the industry hardens. Binance Markets Ltd., an affiliate of top global crypto bourse Binance, was told by the Financial Conduct Authority it has until the evening of June 30 to confirm it has removed all advertising and financial promotions, according to the authority\u2019s register. The exchange must also make clear on its website, social media channels and all other communications that it\u2019s no longer permitted to operate in the U.K. Binance Markets won\u2019t be able to resume U.K. operations without prior written consent\u2026.. The move extends a regulatory crackdown on the cryptocurrency sector amid concerns about its potential involvement in money laundering and fraud\u2026. A \u201csignificantly high\u201d number of cryptoasset businesses aren\u2019t meeting the required standards under the money laundering regulations, which has resulted in an unprecedented number of businesses withdrawing their applications, an FCA spokesperson said.\u201d \u2022\u00a0If it\u2019s too whiffy for the UK\u2026.\nToday\u2019s Fear & Greed Index: 42 Fear (previous close: 44 Fear) [CNN].

Current: 186 (Remember that bringing on the rapture is a good thing, so high is better.)\nUPDATE \u201cAll classrooms to have 2 air purifiers next year, New York City officials pledge\u201d [Chalkbeat]. \u201cTo help curb the spread of COVID, all 56,000 New York City public school classrooms will be equipped with two air purifiers by September, according to the education department. Already, the department has distributed 100,000 air purifiers to schools, and they are working to ensure each classroom has two air purifiers by the time schools fully reopen this fall. The air purifiers are high-efficiency particulate air filters, or HEPA filters, which lower the risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Ventilation has emerged as one of the most critical COVID prevention strategies, and HEPA filters are among the most efficient at capturing human-generated viral particles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u201d \u2022 There is power in a union.\nUPDATE \u201cClinical Application of Nasal Filters: An Observational Study on the Usability of Nasal Filters in Managing Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis\u201d [The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice]. Fom the Abstract: \u201cA recent park study found a substantial preventive effect of a new nasal filter for seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, the nasal filter still needs to prove that it is sufficiently convenient and comfortable for everyday use during a regular pollen season\u2026. Of 834 new users, 630 stated interest in continued use of the filters. On the basis of the findings of this large observational usability study, the nasal filters appear sufficiently convenient and comfortable to use and thus clinically relevant for symptom management for many allergy sufferers.\u201d \u2022\u00a0It occurred to me that nasal filters would be one answer to the use of people who need to remove their masks in order to eat or drink; it least it would prevent ingesting the virus. I can\u2019t find anything about nasal filters and Covid, though. OTOH, nose plugs are a fashion item!\n\u201cHow ancient people fell in love with bread, beer and other carbs\u201d [Nature]. \u201cOn a clear day, the view from the ruins of G\u00f6bekli Tepe stretches across southern Turkey all the way to the Syrian border some 50 kilometres away. At 11,600 years old, this mountaintop archaeological site has been described as the world\u2019s oldest temple \u2014 so ancient, in fact, that its T-shaped pillars and circular enclosures pre-date pottery in the Middle East\u2026. The people who built these monumental structures were living just before a major transition in human history: the Neolithic revolution, when humans began farming and domesticating crops and animals. But there are no signs of domesticated grain at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, suggesting that its residents hadn\u2019t yet made the leap to farming. The ample animal bones found in the ruins prove that the people living there were accomplished hunters, and there are signs of massive feasts. Archaeologists have suggested that mobile bands of hunter-gatherers from all across the region came together at times for huge barbecues, and that these meaty feasts led them to build the impressive stone structures. Now that view is changing, thanks to researchers such as Laura Dietrich at the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. Over the past four years, Dietrich has discovered that the people who built these ancient structures were fuelled by vat-fulls of porridge and stew, made from grain that the ancient residents had ground and processed on an almost industrial scale1. The clues from G\u00f6bekli Tepe reveal that ancient humans relied on grains much earlier than was previously thought \u2014 even before there is evidence that these plants were domesticated. And Dietrich\u2019s work is part of a growing movement to take a closer look at the role that grains and other starches had in the diet of people in the past.\u201d \u2022 Shorter: Not meat. Beer!\nregarding the \"Trusted News Initiative\" and censorship of information regarding COVID vaccine safety, please be aware of the link between Pfizer and Reuters. I would call that a journalistic conflict of interest. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/qQCysxnPX6\n(Malone is Inventor of mRNA vaccines and RNA as a drug.) (UPDATE Malone was a key figure in the development of mRNA. I apologize for taking Malone\u2019s inflated bio at face value; I should have backfilled my more measured comment to the post. Interestingly, when I went looking, all the links were junk, but more importantly Malone had no Wikipedia entry at all. There was, however, a German WikiPedia entry (which supports my \u201ckey figure\u201d formulation). I concluded from these two facts that Malone was being censored by the platforms. Notice that none of this affects the brute fact to which Malone draws attention.) Smith is also a member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (!) and a member of the Atlantic Council. Perhaps one way to look at our elites is that they are one and all entangled in dense networks of conflicted interests; Malone has seen one pattern woven into the rug, but the entire rug is woven of the same kind of pattern, although with different threads. And in some ways, it\u2019s all perfectly normal; board membership is a perk, when you reach a certain level.

The circular design and one-way layout of the store is designed so that customers can\u2019t see what is coming next and fear that they will miss something that they need, according to The Conversation. Because of the difficulty of revisiting a certain item later in the shopping trip, customers are inclined to pick it up and put it in their cart\u2026 The story originated on a satirical website and the posts are making a joke out of Ikea\u2019s store layout.\u201d \u2022 Given the givens, it\u2019s hard to believe that there have been no copy-cats to the satire.\nHard to imagine the same comment, regendered, being applied to, say, James Clapper.

Whatever our choice of terms, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that if there is to be an energy transition, under prevailing conditions (an assumption some may wish to challenge), it is this social class that must make it, simultaneously as decision-makers, consumers and investors.

It is a challenge that puts in question the cohesion and collective intelligence of that group \u2013 which, as history tells us, can hardly be taken for granted, even at the best of times.\u201d \u2022 This is a must-read.

(@RudyHavenstein) June 23, 2021\n\u201cWealth Accumulation and Opportunity Hoarding: ClassOrigin Wealth Gaps over a Quarter of a Century in a Scandinavian Country\u201d (PDF) [American Sociological Review]. \u201cFirst, we find that class-origin wealth gaps have increased in recent years, whereas income inequalities are fairly persistent among men, and increasing among women. We find that educational attainment is important for channeling income inequality, but that education is less important for understanding wealth gaps. Second, we document differences between people whose family contexts were most highly endowed with economic capital and those who grew up in families that were engaged in cultural fields or the professions. Finally, we highlight how analyses based solely on net worth neglect important ways class origin perpetuates and accelerates wealth inequalities via the acquisition of debt. We argue that recent decades have fostered new instruments for opportunity hoarding that are most successfully used by the sons and daughters of the economic upper class.\u201d \u2022 \u201cOpportunity hoarding\u201d has a nice ring to it.\n\u201cWhere Jobless Benefits Were Cut, Jobs Are Still Hard to Fill\u201d [New York Times]. \u201cThe divide raises a fundamental question of what a healthy labor market looks like. Does it mean workers are on such a knife edge that they feel compelled to take the first job that comes along? Or is it one in which employers are the ones who have to scramble and feel pressured to raise wages and improve working conditions? Are the economy and the public better off when workers get to be choosy or when employers do? \u2018One way you might define normal is when employers and workers have the same idea of what an appropriate package looks like, and then the issue is matching up the people with the jobs,\u2019 said Katharine G. Abraham, an economist at the University of Maryland and a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u2018Clearly part of the problem now,\u2019 she said, \u2018is that what employers and what workers think is out of whack.'\u201d \u2022 See, there\u2019s no such thing as class conflict.\n\u201cThe foodies are back, but where are the workers?\u201d [Sightlines]. \u201cThe table shows that the excess demand indicator for the U.S. is 11, and that nearly all the localities we looked at show excess demand for restaurants vs. the supply of potential restaurant workers. The localities currently facing the largest gaps between demand for restaurants and supply of restaurant workers are those local economies that rely strongly on tourism and the provision of leisure/hospitality services\u2014places like Palm Springs, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Virginia Beach, and yes, even the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Economic activity in these places was practically shut down during the pandemic, and while the demand side of the economy has quickly gone back to full speed with many visitors now fully vaccinated (56 percent of the US adult population as of June 21 according to the CDC), the supply side of the economy\u2014fundamentally constrained by the available workforce\u2014is unable to go from zero to 60 so fast.\u201d\n\u201cU.S. Unemployment Rescue Left at Least 9 Million Without Help\u201d [Bloomberg]. \u201c[A]t least 9 million Americans thrown out of work by the pandemic\u2026 didn\u2019t receive any unemployment benefits despite the largest deployment of economic aid in U.S. history, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek estimate based on a review of more than a year\u2019s worth of U.S. Department of Labor data. That\u2019s a hole in the safety net as big as the population of Virginia\u2026. Half the 64.3 million people who sought help through the regular unemployment program from March 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021, were rejected or not paid, the data show. That\u2019s twice the rate during the Great Recession. \u2026 To be sure, the scale of the help has been remarkable. About 49 million workers\u201430% of the U.S. labor force\u2014received at least one weekly payment, according to the data. More than $750 billion in unemployment benefits has been paid by the U.S. Treasury, compared with $28 billion in 2019. Yet this crisis has illustrated the system\u2019s frailties, including aging IT infrastructure, understaffed state agencies, and often arbitrary rules. The data also highlight stark differences among states. California paid more than 70% of claims for regular unemployment during the 13 months beginning in March 2020, while Montana didn\u2019t pay benefits to 89% of those who applied. The maximum payment ranges from $235 a week in Mississippi to $855 in Massachusetts. Almost all states offer 26 weeks of benefits in normal times, though in Alabama the limit is 14 weeks.\u201d \u2022 Cheer up. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as the health care system. And averages conceal:\nNeed to keep saying this: The fact that personal income remained at or above trend through the whole pandemic period is a huge policy success \u2014 should be the expectation for all recessions from now on. It's also an important reason to expect strong growth over next few years. pic.twitter.com/DVmi5BkWGv\n\u201cDo US firms have an incentive to comply with the FLSA and the NLRA?\u201d [Petersen Institute for International Economics (!)]. \u201cIn the case of the [Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)] minimum wage and overtime provisions, typical willful violators are required to pay back wages owed and in some cases additional penalties, if detected by the Department of Labor (DOL). Based on available data on the penalties levied, a typical firm would need to expect a chance of at least 78-88 percent that its violation would be detected in order to have an incentive to comply with the FLSA. In practice, the probability of detection many firms can expect to face is likely much lower than this. In the case of the [National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)], a firm that fires a worker illegally is required to reinstate the worker with back pay if the violation is detected. Based on empirical estimates of the effect of unionization on firm profits, a typical firm may have an incentive to fire a worker illegally for union activities if this illegal firing would reduce the likelihood of unionization at the firm by as little as 0.15-2 percent. These analyses illustrate that neither the FLSA nor the NLRA penalty and enforcement regimes create sufficient incentive to comply for many firms. In this context, the substantial evidence of minimum wage and overtime violations, and of illegal employer behavior toward unions, is not surprising.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about critical race theory?\u201d [Sam Kriss, Idiot Joy Showland (Temporarily Sane)]. \u201cThe movement that critical race theory broke from is critical legal studies, or CLS. Briefly, CLS argues that the law is not as it presents itself, an impersonal arbiter between equal persons, but instead exists to uphold structures of inequality within society. This is not a particularly novel insight\u2026. Critical race theory has its own intellectual roots (more on that shortly), but its history as a movement is usually traced back to the CLS conferences of the mid to late 1980s. At the 1986 conference, a long and panicked spat broke out after participants were asked \u2018what is it about the whiteness of CLS that discourages participation by people of colour?\u2019\u2026 If critical race theory\u2019s organisational history is grounded in the split from CLS, in its intellectual history it begins as a response to the perceived failure of the civil rights movement. Thanks to decades of activism, black Americans were legally identical to whites, formally equal in a system that now claimed to operate on a racially neutral basis \u2013 but for millions, things had simply not improved.\u201d \u2022 Hard to excerpt.

Everyone wants a Tesla but nobody wants electroplating vats; everyone wants an expressway but nobody wants a freight spur because of the noise. At this point, the only thing stopping it will either be a total rejection of plastic consumerism and global trade or ecological collapse and revolution. I\u2019m warm towards the latter.\nThere was also much knowledge and social trust lost in this. The drive to get everyone into new service jobs deprived industry of experienced manufacturing engineers who are needed to actually construct this green future. So long as those people are shoved to the margin of society they\u2019ll continue associating green work with social humiliation and dismissal. The lack of respect for the lower half by the top 1% is what will ultimately do the entire system in, either in the form of violent social revolution or climate change wiping out their investments. Consider if we had another Dust Bowl \u2013 food prices spike as people migrate to new regions. Traffic through dusty regions effectively stops, and commerce logjams nationwide as speculators take a loss. And vice versa, if major coastal flooding takes out a large port like the one in LA then global commerce stops. If Saudi oil does not flow then cars become unusable and that industry collapses too. Targeted attacks on Saudi refineries would cause a permanently unfixable situation. Same for rare earth mines in Chile or Africa, if they are closed by striking workers.\nAll of this speaks to the untenable nature of capitalism.

So I think you may have been triggered. Doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything he says, but surely he is prima facie correct on the conflicts of interest here?\nTriggered? Huh? No, just surprised that you\u2019d post a tweet by him. It is very easy to see CoIs everywhere and sometimes one must be careful not to assume the existence of a CoI implies wrongdoing. Selection bias. You assume too much my friend.\nCan you point to where in the article you linked Robert Malone is referenced? I couldn\u2019t find him mentioned anywhere. In an interview I saw he said he was fully vaccinated.\nMy mistake. He is not in the article, only in the comments.\n(Waiting the the MSM to report serious conflicts of interest by someone important to the official narrative \u2122 is going to be a loooong wait. imo.)\nI\u2019m not claiming the CoI is untrue, just surprise at the posting of a tweet from a person I gathered supported the notion that the spike protein is cytotoxic which arose from an apparent misrepresentation/misunderstanding of a Scripps study.\nSorry, Salk study.\nhttps://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/\nMore ad hom. The tweet is making a point solely about commercial relationships and undisclosed conflicts of interest.\nNo. Conflicts of interest are 100% voluntary and are an announcement of intent to defraud the public, until proven otherwise. Elites do not and have never deserved any presumptions in their favor.

Not constructive.\nThese CoIs exist because of the systematic decriminalization of them in the 80s & 90s under the euphemism \u201cderegulation\u201d which makes it sound like the regulated behavior wasn\u2019t criminal: it was and isn\u2019t now.\nFrom homeless encampments everywhere we no longer notice to accelerating mortality particularly amongst the \u201cessential\u201d, the evidence is in.\nMaybe you know them, maybe in person they are nice people.

While likely not legally criminal, definitely immoral. Okay, not defending the behavior, and what I will say may smack of whataboutism, but how exactly do, say, you excuse the obvious dependence you have on the very criminal structures you critique?\nYou are online and have the time to comment here, as I do, and the time to reflect, so we both depend at least on the services afforded by tech. I am not accusing anyone of being a hypocrite, but, at least for myself, I have had to come to terms with the hypocricy of my own life, living as I do in a developed country.\nI do not know where to begin to formulate any solutions to the problems you define, but I agree that they are institutional problems. I stand by the witch hunt characterization above, though, since, for some, faced with what they perceive as rampant immorality/criminality may desire to burn it all down in righteous indignation.\nAgain, sounds a lot like whataboutism, and I\u2019ll accept the accusation, but I\u2019ve given this a lot of thought over the years and haven\u2019t come to any good solutions that don\u2019t involve me unplugging, which I am reluctant to do.\nI suggest you read this post. Our society is corrupt top to bottom. Being tainted to some degree is pretty much required to maintain one\u2019s position in a large organization.\nI\u2019ve spent almost 30 years working in the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) sector, my entire adult life. When I first started, it was viewed as a most suitable career choice for middle class not particularly aspirational sorts who wanted security, respectability and a recognisable position in the community. It was never supposed to be a passport to significant wealth or even much more than very modest wealth. It was certainly never supposed to be anything which oppressed or harmed anyone.\nBy the early 1990\u2019s the rot, which had started to set in during the mid-1980\u2019s, had begun to accelerate. Most regular readers of Naked Capitalism know how the movie ended. If only it was just a work of fiction. For those of you who have suffered financially, emotionally, physically (or all three) through an unlawful foreclosure, fee gouging, predatory lending, junk insurance or scam financial products you will know what the consequences of an industry which threw away its moral compass and any sense of a social contract are.\nFor those of us on the inside, we don\u2019t deserve any sympathy. But I\u2019d like to offer a glimmer of insight into the conflict that those of us with any sort of conscience wrestle with because it is a conflict which is going to shape our societies over the next generation.\nIncreasingly, if you want to get and hang on to a middle class job, that job will involve dishonesty or exploitation of others in some way. Industries such as finance have seized and held onto larger and larger proportions of the economy.\nThe same disproportionate growth can be seen in financialised healthcare and finacialised education. Naked Capitalism has broken story after story of how these businesses have demonstrated a near-endless capacity for scandal, fraud and wrongdoings of every conceivable sort.\nhttps://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/10/clive-naked-capitalism-ammunition-war-information-2.html\nCorruption in drug research is a widely acknowledged practice. And that goes double for the efforts to protect blockbuster drugs when they are found out to have serious side effects.\nI left McKinsey in 1987 because I saw bad practices then, and the McKinsey (and Goldman) of that era were paragons of virtue compared to what they became later.\nSeems legit.\nYou launch a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by making a multi-font ad hominem and then don\u2019t like having your cooking served up to you? You don\u2019t get to call foul after your misconduct. Your comment is pure projection.\nTriggered in the sense that you seem to have immediately reacted to the key word, \u201cMalone,\u201d and not the the actual content of what he tweeted. It\u2019s like getting excited about the wrapping of a package without actually opening it. Personally, I think it\u2019s good to know that the former CEO of Reuters is on Pfizer\u2019s board (even though he knows as much about vaccines as the members of Boeing\u2019s board know about aircraft manufacturing). Your mileage may vary, and apparently does. The brute fact presented in his tweet would be true no matter who posted it, whether it be Tucker Carlson or (God rest his soul) Karl Marx. See on genetic fallacy here.\nAlfred \u2014 Your link is 100% garbage. The article it links to focuses on three articles that the author says anti-vaxxers point to to support their case. None of the three articles is by Malone.\nThe only reference to Malone at all is by a commenter way down the thread, who mentions Malone and includes a link to the Darkhorse podcast in which Malone discusses evidence that the lipid nanoparticles and spike proteins do not stay put in the shoulder muscle, and evidence that Ivermectin may be effective in preventing and treating Covid.\nFinally, do you know that Malone himself took a Covid vaccine? Hardly the mark of an anti-vaxxer.\nI tink ya got da wrong poster\u2013I know it\u2019s vogue to rate me, but please.\nI\u2019m sure most of the scout-brains here (to differing degrees) are all on the subversive list.\nYves, Lambert, Jerri \u2013 I know you all have your different things going on, but if you need a place to hide in der Deutschen Vaterland, ya\u2019ll got my e-mail.

It worked in the US, why not here!\nMassinissa \u2014 You are correct! My mistake. I meant Arthur. Thanks.\n\u201cInventor\u201d only according to Dr. Malone\u2019s twitter, of which a significant portion is dedicated to countering \u201cgaslighting academics\u201d (his words). +1 grain: NaCl, taken, Malone co-authored \u201cCationic liposome-mediated RNA transfection\u201d (1989) which described one method of \u201ccapping\u201d the sequence which improved the volume of sequence replication as measured by bioluminescent protein. Capped sequences or not, the technique producing regulatory sequences from eukaryote genes was published in 1985. Studies of actual in vivo mRNA treatments in animals date back to 1990-92.\nDr. Malone earned a gov\u2019t whistleblower complaint for proposing a $21 million study during the Trump Administration to study the efficacy of Pepcid AC in fighting Covid-19, and *almost* got the cash. Now he might be trying to pad his credentials.\nHis website claims he was awarded a total of $9 billion in indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, grants and contracts over the five-year period between 2011-2016, or the equivalent of the nation of Fiji\u2019s GDP over those same five years or a single year of Iceland\u2019s GDP. I think Malone skipped a decimal place or two in those calculations.\nI think this is correct, Malone may have made some important contributions over thirty years ago but then seems to have abandoned it (like just about everybody else) because the innate immune response made it non-viable. As the failure of the CureVac trial just thoroughly demonstrated it was Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman\u2019s contributions in the early aughts of replacing uracil nucleosides in mRNA with pseudouridine isomers to disguise it from the immune system that made it a viable technology.\nWhere did you get the idea that a man who has spent his entire career in virology and vaccine development is antivax? The oncologist who authors the Respectful Insolence website undoubtedly has some valuable insight on assorted issues of medical misinformation, but I\u2019ll trust Dr. Malone\u2019s observations on vaccines before most anyone else.\nMalone is no anti-vaxer. He has stated that he received the Moderna vaccine. He may be mistaken but he is knowledgeable and acting in good faith. Insulting him and lumping him and his views in with others who are less well informed is a smear campaign. Such are the times in which we live. It\u2019s little wonder, as noted above, that the \u201cUS ranks last among 46 countries in trust in media\u2026\u201d I\u2019m so old that my living memory of being lied to by the press and my government thus producing horrific consequences dates back to the the Gulf of Tonkin incident.\nHere is Malone misunderstanding the Salk study. You say good faith. I will accept that, but again, the amount of spike that leaves the arm is orders of magnitude below that showing cytotoxic effect as per the lead on the Salk study (in his Twitter). So, Malone got it wrong at the very least. Does he retract? Idk.\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/rwmalonemd/status/1406777926855671811\nSomebody can have both concerns against the covid vaccine and not be an antivaxxer\u2026 A good example is somebody who takes a HEP A or Measles vaccine probably doesn\u2019t think twice since they have been deployed for decades without issue. Somebody should think twice about an Anthrax vaccine given its link to gulf war syndrome. Somebody might and should think twice about taking a covid vaccine if it has had limited time on the market and there is seemingly a concerted effort to hide data regarding side effects to the vaccines. At this point reporting of adverse reactions is only voluntary, and as of May the CDC is now only tracking hospitalizations and deaths, not general adverse reactions. That is hiding/obscuring what could be important data.\nIndeed. I\u2019m a stroke risk (not because of the commentariat, I hasten to add.) So I watch the blood clotting and vascular disease studies very, very carefully. That doesn\u2019t make me antivax at all.\nNeed to keep saying this: The fact that personal income remained at or above trend through the whole pandemic period is a huge policy success \u2014 should be the expectation for all recessions from now on.

Nice that they admit they know their audiences are dolts though. :)\nCombine those media lie themes with the deceptions in the Michelin bezzle article and a typical pattern emerges. People will try to get away with anything if when they think know that nothing will happen to them. The only ones with any fear are the precariat, proles and other outgroups. They have the fear of God instilled in them while those up line, in that Big Club, remain agnostic.\nI have read it from people who know the subject better than I do, that no translation really does Sappho justice, her poetry is like a fine wine that does not travel well.\nI added a few orts and scraps. Please refresh your browsers.\nThe former framing says there are too many able educated people, which notion makes my skin crawl.\nThe latter says a few bastards are pulling up the ladder behind them which dovetails with what I\u2019ve been watching for 50 years.\nI wonder if you realize that anyone who sees this post has already refreshed their browser, and so can already see any new links you have posted. That is unless you are front-running this post ahead of adding the links\u2026\nJohn Siman: Here is Jim Powell\u2019s translation, in Sapphic stanzas.\nFrom The Poetry of Sappho (Oxford University Press 2007), translated by Jim Powell.\n[I consider this poem by Sappho to be one of the greatest antiwar poems of all times.]\nWell, not anti-war but anti-Homer in the sense that she\u2019s his rival for the honor of greatest poet ever. In the priamel she considers and then denies the superlative beauty of Iliadic heroes and horses and ships: superlative beauty belongs instead, she contends, to \u03ba\u1fc6\u03bd\u2019 \u1f44\u03c4\u03c4\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u2014 to the one for whom one feels passionate love \u2014 in this case, her beloved Anactoria. And since Anactoria\u2019s erotic beauty exceeds any Iliadic martial beauty, Sappho can claim to defeat Homer in this contest, for her subject matter is more beautiful than his!\nUnfortunately, it could be harder because it\u2019s not just \u201cthe capitalist class.\u201d Upper-middle class and gentry class people have a higher standard of living because of these cheaper goods and services. The benefits aren\u2019t just economic either: more than a few upper-middle class and gentry class people believe that \u2018unskilled labor\u2019 deserves lower wages because they are unworthy of higher wages. That\u2019s where the real challenge will come: not from the economic costs, but from the reality that some people like large wage differences because they allow some people to feel better than others.\nhttps://mikethemadbiologist.com/2021/06/28/poverty-and-primus-inter-pares/\nNuh-unh, the PMC gentry don\u2019t get to talk their way out of \u201cthe capitalist class\u201d when it\u2019s their job to reproduce capitalism.\nIt\u2019s well past time to take those \u201csome people\u201d who like to feel better than others, and deny them all access to society until they are broken enough to prostrate themselves to the working class for their morning coffee, every day, forever.\nThe upper middle or gentry classes need cheap, exploitable labor far more intimately than the rich. They\u2019re the ones who couldn\u2019t afford to eat preprepared restaurant meals if they were paying fairly for delivery service. They could not afford much private cab travel if Uber drivers weren\u2019t desperate. They could not afford 4000 sq ft houses if the houses were built by men who were paid union scale wages. They could not have as many shoes, suits, or resort vacations without exploitative labor practices. Casual, regular consumption of these pseudo upper class goods and services was beyond the reach of their parent and grandparents in the 1960s and 70s, in large part because workers\u2019 wages were relatively higher, with better benefits, pensions, etc.\nThe rich like Bezos rack up more millions and billions when their workers are impoverished, but for them the extra zeros are not as visceral. The upper middle types have to actually cut back on cab rides, restaurant meals, and Hawaiian vacations when the working class gets paid fairly. They would feel the impact of fair and honest wages far more than the rich. I\u2019d feel that impact. Almost everyone writing here would. That\u2019s the rub.\nMaybe these upper middle or gentry families will not be happy until the clock is turned back a century and once more they can afford to have cheap personal servants like their counterparts in the east. Maybe they grew up watching \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d and asking themselves why they cannot afford to have their own \u2018Alice\u2019. And Mike Brady was just an architect after all back in the 70s so why not them.\nI should also add \u2013 Yes the early TSR stuff was all in Wisconsin.\n\u2026. now that I think about it there is probably a serious history dissertation on earl RPGs. TSR, Flying Buffalo, Chaosium, GDW, Judges Guild, SJG, etc. all have lots of stories that are likely to get lost soon and all of them, and more, contributed to what would become RPGs and RPGs cultural impact.\nGoogle the \u201cDesigners and Dragons\u201d series of books from Evil Hat. The ones about the \u201970s and \u201980s have all those stories that would otherwise be lost.\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up, the stupid of ObamaCare.\nOne Democratic aide described the Medicaid expansion gap as one of the hardest policy issues they had ever encountered.\nAnything to stop Medicare For All.\nIn Congress, health policy aides are exploring whether the federal government could run Medicaid expansions in the 12 holdout states, or if it could provide better insurance subsidies that customers could use to buy private coverage on the Obamacare marketplaces.\nEighteen states and the District of Columbia, all with Democratic leadership, joined the program when it began in 2014. Twenty more states have since joined, including six that used ballot initiatives to circumvent Republican legislatures and governors opposing the program. That includes Oklahoma, which will begin enrolling patients into Medicaid expansion this Thursday.\nMr. McKeown is, like many other Republicans, opposed to the idea of enlarging the role of public health insurance. He also worries that providing free government health insurance will discourage adults in Wyoming from working \u2014 and that those who do work will have to cover the new Medicaid enrollees\u2019 costs in the form of higher taxes.\n\u201cWe\u2019d be penalizing hardworking Americans to make sure everyone gets on a program,\u201d Mr. McKeown said. \u201cI think it\u2019s terrible, and gets us closer to one-payer health care.\u201d\nEven the pandemic isn\u2019t enough to instill a sense of morality in Liberal Democrats, alas.\nWell this makes me cry, and I am retired on Medicare. Workplaces are not where you get health care. I was repeatedly denied fulltime work because it would mean they had to give me healthcare. The fubar burns\n\u2018Workplaces are not where you get health care.\u2019\nI don\u2019t know of any other country off-hand that has this system though there may be some. Maybe Upper Volta or something. Even thirty years ago people could expect to have several careers in their working lives so having healthcare tied to a job sounds like an unnecessary crimp on worker flexibility. And that was back then. Having a government responsible for healthcare takes a burden off business and decreases their costs so the only reason to keep it is so that some business people can have more \u2018control\u2019 over their workers obviously. Like the same CEOs wanting their workers back in the offices once more after they have worked from home simply so that they can watch over them and get in their faces again.\n\u201cEven the pandemic isn\u2019t enough to instill a sense of morality in Liberal Democrats, alas\u2026.\u201d\nFor profit sick care is what they have been paid to promote for years and people are supposed to be crazy, conspiracy theorists if there is doubt they are interested at all in public health and well-being.\nThe Ant Thrush made me think of last week when I wondered if the birds around here ate ants. This is what I found:\nHow do birds get rid of the formic acid of wild ants? Both the poison sac and crop are located close together in the ant\u2019s abdomen. Birds that want to eat ants must remove the formic acid but not damage the crop, as it contains up to 30 percent of the total food value of an ant.\nSupporters of the prey-preparation hypothesis believe that birds adopted anting as a means of inducing the hapless ants to rid themselves of the poison. By grabbing the ant\u2019s thorax (anterior), a bird does no damage to the poison sac or crop in the abdomen (posterior). When it passes the ant through its feathers during the anting process, the rubbing action induces a defense mechanism in the ant, causing it to eject formic acid. Anting continues until the poison sac is empty. Then the morsel can be swallowed harmlessly.\nOther uses for ants could be using the formic acid to deter parasites. If you are interested, a place where I started: https://www.birdwatchingdaily.com/news/science/anting-widespread-fascinating-purpose-uncertain/\nMourning Doves routinely practice the passive form of anting, lying with wings spread upon the ants here.\nThey will stand around waiting their turns on the favored spots in my leaf mulched beds. Often times Cardinals and Blue Jays are in the queue also. Its always civil, unlike at the feeder.\nRegarding the New York Magazine article about January 6th: oh, well, there goes the Insurrection narrative.\nInteresting that NY Magazine, home to Jonathan \u201cI\u2019m a Peeliever\u201d Chait and all things TDS, should feature reporting that indirectly exposes their five years of coverage of Trump as largely bs. Happily surprised, since I would normally have expected an article telling me to check under my bed for Proud Boys\u2026\nTrying to get to an 1876 scenario seems to have vanished in the mists of time. I must have imagined the whole thing, stupes in the WH were thinking Pence had agency?\nCould you tell me what issue that\u2019s in? DuckDuckGo is not my friend, and neither is the New York Magazine web site. The article you describe sounds like something I\u2019d like to read, but as far as I can tell it hasn\u2019t been linked at NC. Yet.\nYour hated Libertarian Lurker here\u2026on the D&D comments and the MidWest.\nI just want to start by saying I effin hate Twitter for how it denies a writer structure, grammar, and other tools for expressing coherent thought. I am trying to guess what Aaron King is talking about from his quick snippets. I think he is saying that no one that started TSR and Dungeons and Dragons ever became rich despite it\u2019s vast influence and I would agree with that. There have been books written about the history of the game, so I\u2019ll give a quick cliff notes version of the first creators, and I encourage others to add to my comment or correct it as needed.\nGary Gygax was a huge fan and amateur designer of tabletop wargames, where each side acted as a commander controlling forces against one another. Napoleonic warfare was the most popular at the time, and tabletop gaming was huge in the Midwest.\nDave Arneson was a younger player with a lot of energy and imagination. He\u2019s playing tabletop wargames with a guy named David Wesley, David Wesley pushed a game called Braunstein where large amount of players took control of individual combatants in a Napoleonic skirmish. Dave Arneson gets excited about this and shares some of the stuff he learns from Wesley with Gary Gygax. This is all going down in Wisconsin and Minnesota in the late 60 to early 70s.\nNow Gygax is looking to establish a new tabletop wargame that can stand out from the crowd, and since he\u2019s a huuuuge science fiction and fantasy buff (see his famed Appendix N), he decides on Napoleonic warfare with a fantasy theme (rangers instead of riflemen, fighters instead of soldiers, magic-users instead of artillery, etc). He calls this Chain Mail and it becomes popular enough, but Arneson starts trying to play his game using some of the Braunstein influence he gets from Wesley. Since Tolkien is having a revival at the time, this becomes insanely popular and Gygax quickly recognizes the potential.\nGygax and Arneson write Dungeons and Dragons together. Let me state that Gygax has the professional knowledge, sales experience, and literacy to put together a solid product while the much wilder Arneson is the guy who was the experimenter. Gygax and his close friend Don Kaye get together with the Blume brothers to finance the first D&D box set via the TSR company. It takes off entirely from the tabletop wargame culture around Gygax\u2019s gaming circle. It\u2019s hugely successful, but no one really gets rich.\nGary Gygax of Wisconsin: Eventually kicks Arneson out of TSR, but in turn is kicked out by the Blume brothers and an infamous CEO named Lorraine Williams that the Blumes brought in. Goes through several legal battles that drains whatever wealth he made in the company and is only brought back into some recognition in his final years.\nDave Arneson of Minnesota: Kicked out by Gygax. Tim Kask was brought in by Gygax to start Dragon Magazine (you guys would love the hippyish Tim Kask). Anyway, when I asked Tim Kask why Arneson was booted, Tim got sad and said money and success went a bit to everyone\u2019s heads. He seems to have liked Arneson, but said Arneson couldn\u2019t stay focused and others had to pick up his slack in the company. Arneson did not make much money either.\nDavid Wesley of Minnesota: Was hired by TSR for a Valley Forge game, but never really got the name recognition he deserved until recent times.\nDon Kaye of Wisconsin: Don dies a year after D&D is published. This is a twin blow to Gary. Don was one of his best friends and also helped fund TSR. Without his financial backing, Gary has to depend on the Blumes.\nThe Blume Family of Illinois: Brian Blume was a fan of the game and hung out at Gygax\u2019s table. His family had money, and so he was the financial backing for the TSR company and his family is the one that mostly profited from the game. When Don Kaye dies, Gary has to depend more on the Blume family, giving them a lot of control over TSR. In the mid-80s, Gary and the Blumes have a large falling out over the direction of the company. Gary wanted a conservative approach, while the Blume\u2019s wanted to be aggressive and buy up other gaming properties to encourage growth. This eventually led to investors stepping in with Lorraine Williams as CEO.\nAnyway, Lorraine Williams is a Berkeley, California girl and the family owned the Buck Rogers IP, which she tried to revive through TSR funding\u2026 After she runs the company to the ground, TSR is sold off to Wizards of the Coast and is moved to the west coast.\nTom Moldvay of Ohio: Designer.\nLawrence Schick of Ohio: Head of Design at TSR.\nFrank Mentzer of Pennsylvania: Wrote the later influential BECMI rules after moving to Wisconsin.\nTim Kask of Illinois: First editor of Dragon Magazine and told me he did his best work high. Gygax was fine with his habit. The Blumes were not. Was never credited for taking Arneson\u2019s work for Blackmoor setting and putting it into a publishable product, but unofficially most TSR alumni recognize him as a co-writer.\nJames Ward of Wisconsin: Great guy. Extremely important in TSR\u2019s history. Great taste in board games. Stuck around in TSR after Gygax was kicked out. Highly important for his decision to go against upper management\u2019s suggestions and hire SSI to publish the amazingly successful Gold Box series of D&D video games.\nRob Kuntz of Wisconsin: Extremely important play tester for early D&D. Some influential game designs.\nErol Otus of Wisconsin: Famous for the early amateurish, but creepy TSR art. Left the company early to pursue an art degree, but highly influential.\nDavid A. Trampier of Missouri: Another famous and early amateur artist. This story is sad. His work is incredible, but last anyone heard of him he quit TSR to work as a taxi driver. His company went under and he died of cancer.\nGuys like Trampier and Otus were shown the door once TSR started becoming successful and became more corporate, but their art is considered more evocative than much of what came after.\nSo yeah\u2026 D&D was very successful and almost completely dependent upon people in the Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois area. None of them became rich outside of Lorraine Williams and the Blumes. James Ward was probably the most financially successful out of the worker bees, as he was a very good manager of the staff and was also able to navigate office purges. The rest struggled most of their lives.\nGobelki Tepe fascinates, pedestals where honored dead were placed and could be flown to heaven by the vultures. Maybe with the idea of fertility for growing plants, we started burying our dead. Or maybe finding Dad dropped onto some barren desert by a careless big bird was too much. The idea of Heaven in the sky had to come from somewhere as did Hell, buried in the ground.\nI am going with observations of attraction, myself. I have found that having the compost pile as far from my house as possible keeps me from having to deal with the useful agents of putrefaction and recycling. Burying flesh and bone keeps flies and bears from appearing, although for bears, it has to be deeply buried. It was a while before some people realized that it had to be kept clear of water supplies. Unless you are in a desert, where things mummify, you have to think of what will show up to \u201ctake care\u201d of a carcass.\nI had the same reaction to the In Our Time reading of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnet 130, which I always viewed as a satire on poetic rhetoric\u2013as stated in the poem itself, but which, unless I somehow missed it, the program\u2019s discussants omitted to mention.\nI bet that Brown gets full financial backing from the DNC along with a whole bunch of consultants parachuted in.\nNothing new there, always been a lot of grift in that industry. Used to work for a seafood wholesaler who sold high end seafood and caviar to chichi restaurants and saw this type of thing firsthand. Once after work I went out to eat at one of those high end places that grew much of their own food and which was also one of out customers. You could see the gardens surrounding the restaurant so they were at least somewhat legit with their claims, but after eating there I did notice a tendency towards embellishment. We ordered a mackerel appetizer and the waitron said it was very fresh and had been caught by the chef himself earlier that day which I found amusing since my company had delivered the mackerel to them that very morning. At least they were correct about the freshness, if not the provenance.\nWith the caviar, things could get more serious. There was one Russian restaurant that we only occasionally dealt with, but at one point their purchaser who was a foppish Brit ordered a bunch of caviar from us all of a sudden and later stiffed us for it. I spoke with other caviar wholesalers to warn them about this guy and found he had contacted them recently too looking for product out of the blue. I found through the grapevine that the purchaser had expensive tastes \u2013 he evidently carried one of those little kicky dogs around in a Louis Vuitton bag. The British guy was the only one I had contact with and he made many empty promises about payment before abruptly disappearing. The next time I called, it was a guy with a very heavy Eastern European accent who answered and customer service was not his strong suit to put it mildly. He answered with an annoyed \u2018yeah\u2019 and when I told him I was looking for the British guy he said he was gone, and when I told him the restaurant owed us a lot of money, the response was \u2018So?\u2019. Trying to piece things together, I called a neighboring restaurant we also sold to and the owner told me that lately he only saw some heavy-set, mean looking guys sitting out front across the street drinking coffee all day, and actual customers not so much. If the restaurant had ever been legit it sounded like it had become a front for something else and I decided it would be in my company\u2019s and my own best interest to stop trying to collect from them.\nMy best guess was the British guy had either ripped off the wrong people or been swindled by them, and was desperately trying to produce some legit product to make good. Maybe he couldn\u2019t and the heavies took over, who knows? He definitely seemed worried about something worse than not paying his company\u2019s bills though.\nDefinitely a lot of grift in the caviar industry and if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and just like throwing money around to impress, you may order beluga and wind up with some flying fish roe dyed with squid ink.\nFoppish. Great old word. But can we really use it any more? \u2018Don\u2019t you trigger me with your micro-gressions!\u2019\nHere\u2019s a link to an in-depth interview with a guy who knows how it should be done. It was published about a year ago by the Purdue University College of Liberal Arts \u201cResearch News,\u201d and its title is \u201cHow to design a war technology: What wins? What is reasonably cheap or too expensive?\u201d The interviewee is Pierre Sprey, a long-time collaborator with USAF Col. John Boyd.\nGood interview with Pierre Sprey, one of the designers of the legendary A10 \u201cWarthog\u201d and the much vaunted F16.\nHey, that\u2019s \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle. He mentored Charlie Chaplin and discovered Buster Keaton, Monty Banks and Bob Hope but who came to a sad ending after being accused of raping and killing a rising actress in the 1920s-\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Arbuckle\nSomeone was talking about arch-dissembler Jordan Peterson a few days ago and the name of the World\u2019s Most Perplexed Head of Cauliflower, Steve Pinker, came up. I once read an article Pinker purportedly wrote by himself and was a little startled by the sheer stupidity of his arguments. Well, not arguments, assertions. Crazy stuff like the philosophers of old were really scientists but didn\u2019t realize it. Bizarre.\nThe fact this man occupies the position he does is a dire sign of the times. He\u2019s a living example of those sidebar illustrations the monks used to fill their books with in the Dark Ages; the pope as a monkey or some bishop as a mule. Here is an article dissecting one of his assaults on literature:\nhttps://www.salon.com/2019/01/26/steven-pinkers-fake-enlightenment-his-book-is-full-of-misleading-claims-and-false-assertions/\n\u201cWhat I found was startling, but not altogether surprising in light of Bell\u2019s observations: Mined quotes, cherry-picked data, false dichotomies, misrepresented research, misleading statements and outright false assertions on nearly every page.\u201d\nFinally, this man is an archetype of the fussy haired over 40 type that years of public presentation work has taught me to be on guard against.\nhttps://www.essentiafoundation.org/reading/whats-out-there-when-our-brains-quit-telling-us-stories/\n\u201cThe paradoxical idea that brain activity operates by actually reducing, instead of increasing, awareness is explained by the filter thesis, the idea that our brains are simply \u2018filtering\u2019 a much larger consciousness, reducing it to our ego-consciousness. Do we have any scientific leads on how this filtering actually would take place?\nI think this is the sixty-four thousand dollar question. When I write articles about this filtering process that keeps us from a more expanded awareness I immediately go to our brain and our nervous system and explain how all the input from our five senses is being processed. That\u2019s the first level of filtering. And then there\u2019s the default mode network we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s another level of filtering, where your narrative cuts you off from a broader awareness. So that\u2019s my neural story. But it can\u2019t be all of it. Because what we also see is that, even when people describe having left their body in a near-death experience, they don\u2019t seem to necessarily feel an absolute oneness immediately with everybody; they still experience a sense of self.\u201d\nBig hit on Lockheed in the links. Something is wrong with the Defense thingy.\nWay past time for such public-private or private public partnerships to be operating.\nTime to privatize the whole thing, so corporate managers and execs can get it back under control, neh? Get it running like a business should run? Get some competition going, hey? That\u2019ll fix it.\nAirbus must be looking at this in some disbelief. Boeing is opening up a massive lane for them to go down and sell their aircraft. If this keeps up, Boeing aircraft will end up being like the F-35. How so? The US will try to force their allies to buy their planes in order to prove their loyalty or something.\nBoeing, like Intel, PG&E, GE, IBM and Kodak got so taken up increasing shareholder value that it cannot function anymore. Elon Musk has shot astronauts to the Space Station. Boeing\u2019s Space Capsule is in deep limbo as it rewrites its East Indian software. Perhaps the FAA is trying keep its last slipping grip of relevance and is kick-starting Boeing to reinvent good engineering.\nOn the other side, CDC and FDA are so regulatory captured that they failed the America people but created a couple of new pharmaceutical billionaires. They are so dangerous that they ended masking and social distancing in the USA as the Delta Variant spikes in highly vaccinated Israel and UK. There is no Plan B. Dr. Anthony Fauci can only propagandize to get vaccinated with mRNA vaccines that have proven sided effects in young women and adolescent boys. Side effects that are identical to a coronavirus infection. Although still a hypothesis, since the necessary data has not been generated, the side effects could only have been caused by the human designed artificial spike protein coded into the mRNA.\nCity comptroller! Hardly are those words out, when a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi troubles my sight: reading the Ross Barkan article, I suddenly recall that Brad Lander and Adam Davidson (known to NC readership as Lord Haw-Haw) were roommates in an apartment on the 5700 block of S Kimbark in Chicago, 30 years ago today.

The data collection starts in 1997 and published data are available from 2000. Over the years data sources have changed. Roy Spencer praised Loeb and his co-authors. However, Spencer stated:\n\u201cThe period they study is rather limited, 2005-2019, probably to be able to use the most extensive Argo float deep-ocean temperature data\u201d Spencer also stated: \u201cIt should be noted, however, that the absolute value of the imbalance cannot be measured by the CERES satellite instruments; instead, the ocean warming is used to make an \u2018energy-balanced\u2019 adjustment to the satellite data (which is the \u2018EB\u2019 in the CERES EBAF dataset).\u201d\nTWTW editor Howard Hayden, with extensive research in atomic physics, took strong exception to the paper, as did TWTW reader Brendan Godwin, who retired from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Hayden wrote a rebuttal of the paper to the publisher, Geophysical Research Letters (unpublished because of cost) which provides a basis for further understanding of the greenhouse effect.\n\u201cClimate is determined by how much of the sun\u2019s energy the Earth absorbs and how much energy Earth sheds through emission of thermal infrared radiation.\u201d\n[Earth\u2019s] \u201cClimate is determined by the very large difference between surface radiation and planet radiation, and is most assuredly not determined by minor positive and negative imbalances between absorbed solar energy and radiated IR\u201d [Outgoing infrared radiation].\nIn the rebuttal, Hayden explains that contrary to many claims Venus is not hot due to \u201crunaway greenhouse effect.\u201d\nWith frequent but small, ephemeral exceptions, the radiant heat that a planet emits to outer space equals the heat absorbed from the sun.\u00a0 Indeed, this is true for Earth within 0.3 percent. For Earth, the incoming/outgoing heat rate amounts to about 240 W/m2, averaged over the surface; for Venus, owing to its high 76% albedo, only 156 W/m2.\nThe surface of the planet emits IR according to the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law.\u00a0 The surface of Earth at 288 K emits 390 W/m2, some 150 W/m2 more than the earth emits to space.\u00a0 That 150 W/m2 of heat retention is the cause of the 33 \u00baC temperature rise over the non-GHG Earth with the same albedo. Venus at 737 K emits 16,730 W/m2 from its surface, but only 156 W/m2 into space. The 16,574 W/m2 difference, due to the composition of the extremely dense atmosphere of Venus is what determines the climate of Venus: 511 \u00baC hotter than the hypothetical Venus with the same albedo but no greenhouse effect.\n[Hayden did not account for the emissivity (typically taken to be about 98%, but is likely to be 93%) but using it would change the numbers a bit, but would not affect the general conclusion.]\nOn Earth, above 100 parts per million in volume (ppm), the effectiveness of carbon dioxide (CO2) in blocking outgoing infrared radiation is limited. It is rather like a dragster approaching top speed. What it did may be impressive, but it cannot accelerate much more. The heat of Venus is from its atmospheric pressure at the surface of about 93 times that of Earth at its surface.\nThe January 18, 2020, TWTW discussed a paper by Dewitte, Clerbaus, and Cornelis, the abstract of which stated: \u201cThe increase of the OLR [Outgoing Longwave Radiation] is higher than the decrease of the RSR [Reflected Solar Radiation measured by CERES from 2000 to 2018]. Also, the incoming solar radiation is decreasing. As a result, over the 2000\u20132018 period the Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) appears to have a downward trend of \u22120.16 \u00b1 0.11 W/m2dec.\u201d [Boldface added] Small errors in measurement of two different large quantities can result in large errors in calculating the difference between the two quantities. There is disagreement as to whether the small imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy is positive or negative. The authors of Loeb, et al. should have realized that before making extravagant claims of \u201cunprecedented\u201d to the press.\nThe generally accepted estimate for CO2 concentration before industrialization is 280 ppm, the effectiveness of CO2 to provide additional warming was already severely limited before industrialization. Contrary to claims by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers, adding CO2 to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere will not cause runaway greenhouse. The governments of China and other developing countries in Asia probably realize this, and will probably smile as Western politicians rant, and continue to build coal-fired power plants unless they are paid enormous sums not to. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\nDoublethink or Doubletalk? Doubletalk is the deliberate mixture of sense and nonsense. Being kind, Bjorn Lomborg uses the term doublethink from Orwell (quote above). In the Financial Post (Canada) he writes:\nOur current climate conversation embodies two blatantly contradictory claims. On one side, experts warn that promised climate policies will be economically crippling. In a new report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) states that achieving net-zero in 2050 will likely be \u2018the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced.\u2019 That is a high bar, surpassing the Second World War, the black plague and COVID.\nOn the other side, hand-waving politicians sell net-zero climate schemes as a near-utopia that every nation will rush to embrace. As U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told world leaders gathered at President Biden\u2019s climate summit in April: \u2018No one is being asked for a sacrifice.\u2019\nBoth claims can\u2019t be true. Yet, they are often espoused by the same climate campaigners in different parts of their publicity cycle. The tough talk aims to shake us into action, and the promise of rainbows hides the political peril when the bills come due.\nGeorge Orwell called this willingness to espouse contradictory claims doublethink. It is politically expedient and gets climate-alarmed politicians reelected. But if we want to fix climate change, we need honesty. Currently promised climate policies will be incredibly expensive. While they will deliver some benefits, their costs will be much higher.\nYes, climate change is real and man-made, and we should be smart in fixing it. But we don\u2019t because climate impacts are often vastly exaggerated, leaving us panicked. The UN Climate Panel estimates that if we do nothing, climate damages in 2100 will be equivalent to 2.6 per cent of global GDP. That is a problem but not the end of the world.\nBecause climate news only reports the worst outcomes most people think the damage will be much greater. Remember how we were repeatedly told 2020\u2019s Atlantic hurricane season was the worst ever? The reporting ignored that almost everywhere else, hurricane intensity was feeble, making 2020 one of the globally weakest in satellite history. And even within the Atlantic, 2020 ranked thirteenth.\nLomborg discusses that claims that climate policies will not require significant sacrifices are nonsense and that it is doubtful that China and most poor countries go along with the leaders of wealthy countries demanding sacrifices. Lomborg advocates innovation in green energy rather than sacrifice.\n\u201cThere is no robust evidence that even the worst-case warming scenarios would cause overall economic losses.\u201d\n\u201cBut as time has advanced, new data sets, and even reanalysis of the old data sets, has called those results into question and has shown that temperature (and precipitation) changes likely have insignificant effects on GDP and growth, and the effects are as likely to be positive as they are to be negative.\u201d\nAs stated in the first section, above, neither sacrifice nor innovation in green energy is necessary, but innovation is desirable. However, the difference between doublethink and doubletalk is intent. Often one cannot sense the intent of politicians and it may be better to avoid politicians who engage in either or both. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know precisely when this will happen, but China seems to be betting on the later 2020s, just before it has undertaken to reach peak emissions, giving it plenty of time to blame the West for breach of promise and return to carbon business as usual. That seems like a plausible date to us too.\u201d\nSee link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.\nDo They Think? Manhattan attorney Francis Menton is following the musings of the advisory panels formed under the state\u2019s \u201cClimate Leadership and Community Protection Act\u201d of 2019. The main goals of the act are a 40% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 85% by 2050. It appears that the leadership is lost.\nThe Power Generation Advisory Panel, with the goal of decarbonization of power generation of 70% by 2030 and 100% by 2040, made its recommendations on May 10. Menton writes:\n\u201cThe so-called recommendations evidence a truly astounding level of amateurism and cluelessness on the part of this Panel. It is completely obvious that these people have no idea how to go about \u2018decarbonizing\u2019 the electrical grid, or whether that can be done at all. Indeed, the apparent attitude of the members is that the only thing lacking is political will, and therefore if the appropriate orders are issued by government bureaucrats, then the goals will be accomplished. It appears that not one moment\u2019s thought has been given to the potential engineering difficulties or costs of completely revamping an electrical grid that has taken over 100 years of incremental engineering improvements to develop to its current state.\u201d\nThe panel is largely made up of environmental activists who have little or no knowledge of power generation.\nThe big three problems with decarbonizing an electrical grid would be reliability, cost and storage. Each of those three is barely addressed at all in the Panel\u2019s May 10 presentation, Rather than trying to deconstruct everything, let me focus on the issue of storage.\nThe storage must be sufficient to cover many days of usage \u2014 indeed multiple weeks \u2014 and must also remain safely stored for many months between when the power is generated and when it is used.\nThe panel was clearly told that long-duration is critical for intermittent power. A consultant specifically stated:\n\u201c\u2019the need for dispatchable resources . . . during winter periods of high demand for electrified heating and transportation and lower wind and solar output.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIn other words, they have no idea how it can be done, or whether it can be done, and nobody has even started working on the problem yet. But don\u2019t worry, the electric grid will be 70% decarbonized by 2030, even with hugely increased demand from the likes of (mandatory) electric cars and (mandatory) electric heat in homes. [Analysist] Caiazza\u2019s comment:\n\u201c\u2019Long-duration storage is necessary so depending upon a technology that does not even exist in a pilot project is an incredible risk.\u2019\n\u201cAgain, the term \u2018incredible risk\u2019 seems to me like a wild understatement. The fact is that none of this is real. The only questions are when and how it is all going to fall apart and how much taxpayer money will have been thrown down the drain along the way.\u201d\nRemember, on April 30, 2021, New York prematurely closed Indian Point nuclear power plant which provided 25% of the power used in New York City. The government has no concept how to replace that electricity and now New York plans to decarbonize other electricity generation? \u00a0No massive-scale long-term storage technology exists to provide the huge gaps in power generation that occur with wind and solar. The largest storage technology existing is Bath County Pumped Storage Station in Virginia. It is replenished daily by nuclear and coal-fired power, not renewables. See links under Questioning Green Elsewhere.\nExtreme Heat: According to forecasts, the Pacific Northwest will experience extreme heat on June 27 and 28, possibly breaking all-time records for certain locations. Meteorologist Cliff Mass has an explanation of a unique combination of factors going far beyond usual explanations of \u201cheat dome\u201d or \u201cglobal warming.\u201d He goes through two separate ingredients uniquely combining: 1) \u201cAn unusually strong area of high pressure aloft over our region (known as an upper-level ridge;\u201d and 2) \u201cAn Approaching Trough of Low Pressure That Creates Strong Easterly/Downslope Flow over the Western Slopes of the Cascades.\u201d\nMost homes in the Pacific Northwest do not have air conditioning, and many people will be uncomfortable. As Mass notes, the ability to forecast this extreme heat would have been impossible thirty years ago. Such extreme weather prediction is a product of numerical weather modeling and improving models by weather services. It is saving many lives.\nThe changing winds prompted TWTW to review transmission by the Bonneville Power Authority, which has the largest hydroelectric generation in the US. As of May 4, the total nameplate generation is 27,879 MW of which 79.5% is hydro and 10.5% (2930 MW) is wind. Over the last 7 days, wind power has ranged from about 2200 MW to Zero MW (several times). The erratic nature of wind power places great strain on hydroelectric generation and results in faster wearing out of turbines than originally planned. Relying on wind, with no reliable (dispatchable) backup is folly. See links under Changing Weather and Energy Issues \u2013 US\nMiami Building Collapse: Part of a residential building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed on June 24. Almost immediately some in the carbon cult blamed global warming causing sea level rise. NOAA\u2019s data on sea level rise for Miami Beach stopped in 1981. The closest tidal gage data is for Virginia Key, a barrier island south of Miami Beach, about 30 miles south of Surfside.\n\u201cThe relative sea level trend is 2.97 millimeters/year with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.21 mm/yr based on monthly mean sea level data from 1931 to 2020 which is equivalent to a change of 0.97 feet [30 cm] in 100 years.\u201d\nThis is significantly less than James Hansen\u2019s 2006 prediction of a 600 cm (20 foot) rise by 2100. Although details are not available, one engineering report on the building stated there was slight land subsidence, but not enough to cause a collapse. Subsidence from ground water extraction is a problem in some coastal areas which is solvable by low-cost desalination.

Biden\u2019s Prairie Chicken Fillet\nThe feds use the Endangered Species Act to block fossil fuels.\n\u201cWhy did the lesser prairie chicken cross the road? Apparently to shut down oil and gas development. Witness how the Biden Administration is reviving an Obama Administration effort to list the member of the grouse family under the Endangered Species Act to restrict energy development.\n\u201cLate last month the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) proposed a regulation to list the lesser prairie chicken as either threatened or endangered, depending on the region. More than 95% of the lesser prairie chicken\u2019s range falls on private property across Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado. Its range also overlaps with the Permian Basin\u2014the most productive oil-and-gas shale field in the U.S. Green groups have for years used the Endangered Species Act as a way to restrict land development.\nIn 2015 a federal judge blocked the Obama prairie chicken endangered listing because the Administration had not sufficiently considered alternatives to conserve bird habitat. Businesses and state and federal regulators had already agreed to a plan to support conservation efforts, which gave landowners flexibility to manage their property and compensated them for improving the bird\u2019s habitat.\n\u201cOil and gas companies have since contributed more than $60 million to a conservation fund. While the plan hasn\u2019t been perfectly executed, it seems to be working. An October 2020 study prepared for the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies found that the population of lesser prairie chickens across the five states grew to an estimated 34,408 from 18,142 in 2014.\n\u201cEnvironmental groups nonetheless sued the government in 2016 to force another listing. The Biden Administration has now agreed to re-list the bird, which could restrict energy development on up to 21 million acres of land.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no urgent reason to list the lesser prairie chicken other than to appease green lobbyists and their desire to use every regulation possible to stop development. Candidate Joe Biden promised that he wouldn\u2019t ban oil and gas fracking, but his Administration plans to restrict it step by step with a regulatory onslaught, and the lesser prairie chicken listing seems to be part of the strategy.\u201d\nTransnational elites and American politicos want society to rearrange the energy market. For \u2018society\u2019 read \u2018government.\u2019\n\u201cAmy Myers Jaffe\u2019s \u2018journey thinking about energy as a problem\u2019 began in 1973, waiting in those infamous gasoline lines. She hasn\u2019t been alone in that journey. OPEC\u2019s oil embargo was a defining event that has haunted the thinking of policy makers for decades. It inspired hundreds of books on energy policy. Some now argue that we inhabit an entirely different world from that of OPEC\u2019s heyday. That is Ms. Jaffe\u2019s theme in \u2018Energy\u2019s Digital Future: Harnessing Innovation for American Resilience and National Security.\u2019 She wants our policies to shift accordingly.\n\u201cFirst, Ms. Jaffe notes, our central concern these days is no longer energy shortages or import dependencies. We\u2019ve gone \u2018from scarcity to abundance.\u2019 The new worry is about having too much oil and too much of it burned: ditto for natural gas, oil\u2019s hydrocarbon cousin. That reversal is, of course, driven by worries about climate change and the fact that hydrocarbons still fuel 80% of the world economy. Ms. Jaffe, a research professor at Tufts, joins many others calling for an \u2018energy transition\u2019 to a supposedly inevitable lower-carbon future.[Boldface added]\n\u201cSecond, Ms. Jaffe argues, our era is different because the world now has what she terms \u2018digital energy technologies,\u2019 defined as \u2018the convergence of automation, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things.\u2019 The effect of all those, we\u2019re told, will be a drop in oil demand. Ms. Jaffe embraces the idea of \u2018stranded assets\u2019 coming to those hapless companies that stay invested in hydrocarbons as \u2018digital energy\u2019 suppresses demand and governments require \u2018a regulated transition to cleaner energy sources.\u2019 Her position: \u2018Society . . . cannot afford to let the private sector keep creating infrastructure that undermines long-term societal goals.\u2019 By \u2018society\u2019 she means government. [Boldface added]\n\u201cOne of the challenges \u2018society\u2019 must keep in check is the potential for \u2018digital energy technologies\u2019 to encourage more energy use. Autonomous vehicles\u2014about which Ms. Jaffe devotes many pages\u2014will require the government to \u2018lead in framing the rules\u2019 on how they\u2019re used. And when it comes to electric vehicles, she writes approvingly about the benefit of \u2018an entire country\u2019 that would \u2018ban today\u2019s car technology\u2019 based on the internal combustion engine. Ms. Jaffe assures those bitter clingers (to adapt a phrase) that no one is \u2018proposing repossessing\u2019 their gasoline car. It will be a natural transition\u2014enforced by government.\n\u201cFor all her focus on digital energy, Ms. Jaffe spends a great deal of time exploring the politics, geopolitics and economics of oil\u2014and for good reason. Aspirations aside, petroleum is central to meeting today\u2019s global energy needs; it powers more than 95% of all transportation of goods and people. Even the International Energy Agency\u2019s most aggressive \u2018transition\u2019 forecast sees global oil use in 2050 still roughly 25% higher than in 1973.\n\u201cPoliticians properly fear a repeat of anything like 1973 gasoline lines, and especially the overnight 400% jump in oil prices. Witness what happened in May when hackers took the Colonial Pipeline offline and triggered brief shortages and gas lines in a handful of southeastern states: The administration promptly issued orders to temporarily relax an assortment of regulations to restore supplies quickly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery why this administration and Congress, or indeed scholars and academics like Ms. Jaffe, evince so little concern about the supply-chain risks associated with the \u2018energy transition.\u2019 All the green technologies progressives want the U.S. to move to\u2014wind turbines, solar panels, batteries\u2014depend on imports of the machines themselves, or key parts for them, and especially the critical minerals with which they\u2019re made. Ms. Jaffe does note that China is \u2018the dominant country with the majority of the world\u2019s processing plants for vital minerals and materials for the green revolution.\u2019 But she brushes past the problem by observing that \u2018as demand for the minerals rises, more mines will be developed.\u2019 True, but few if any of those new mines will be in the U.S. Increasing our dependence on foreign powers, some of them hostile, seems like a bad idea.\n\u201cInstead, Ms. Jaffe focuses somewhat admiringly on China\u2019s vaunted \u2018leadership\u2019 and subsidies for electric cars and solar panels. She contends, correctly, that American innovators are at a disadvantage competing with \u2018government-funded Chinese counterparts.\u2019 She believes that amped up R&D is one key to charting a path to new kinds of energy production. So do many transnational elites and American politicos in both parties. So does Microsoft, which in its 2020 climate-policy manifesto conceded that the energy plans it and others favor \u2018will require technology that does not exist today.\u2019 That we are rearranging our economy based on technologies we don\u2019t in fact possess should probably cause more alarm than it does. \u201c\n\u201cMs. Jaffe observes that today the government must engage in the \u2018reshaping\u2019 of \u2018business models.\u2019 But she claims \u2018this not about having the government \u2018pick winners,\u2019 an idea often met with derision by libertarians and others who have more faith in free markets than in politicians to allocate resources.\u2019 The importance of that division in energy policy\u2014faith in markets vs. faith in politicians\u2014hasn\u2019t changed a bit in the past half-century.\u201d\nTL;DR There should be an estimated reading time at the top of this post.\nYes, indeed.\n\u2026. and, obviously, I\u2019m using the word \u201cnovel\u201d loosely.\nThe most depressing and wrong words Lomberg  has written.\n\u201cclimate change is real and some is man made.\u201d\nPlease explain this \u201cclimate change\u201d of which you speak.  I think it has been established that the Earth has become slightly warmer and wetter over the past 100 years.  No other global climate changes have been established.\nOne month trip two years ago.\nFor starters, it pretends that there is no such thng as entropy, which disperses energy into the Heat Death of the Universe, making it unavailable for heating or doing work forever. Every Planck radiator is a maximum entropy generator, increasing entropy by a factor proportional to T^3 while emitting energy proportional to T^4, meaning a great loss of energy is needed to turn it into heat inside a material based on its heat capacity before turning it back to energy at a far lower energy point (longer peak power wavelength). The T^4 power equation is turned upside-down by the IPCC, which ludicrously displays up and down T^4 arrows in the sky, as if energy and entropy magically disappeared.No wonder they draw a downward T^4 arrow representing CO2, claiming it raises surface temps, when its energy comes either from the surface in the first place and automatically has less energy and can raise the temperature way less, or from some magical cloud that because of the lapse rate is at a frigid temp that they ignore, as if any gas emits Planck radiation instead of solids and liquids (coalesced matter) like the surface of the Sun and Earth.\nAlso air convection increases entropy each time it trades heat for work to expand against decreasing pressure. The Earth lapse rate of 6.4K/km gives a total temperature drop of 80C by 14km altitude, not 33C. The increase in temperature caused by the increase of pressure in a fixed volume gives that, and surface convection merely climbs up and down its ladder dissipating energy via entropy.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/adiabatic-lapse-rate\nMeanwhile water evaporation removes large amounts of surface heat and after reaching frigid heights falls back down as precipitation, cooling the surface more than the Sun heated it after blocking yet more solar energy from reaching and heating the surface. So the IPCC claim of some kind of Earth-Sun energy balance is a laugh.\nSo in short, all climate is caused by the solar energy that reaches the surface and drives the temperature in the first place. The surface temperature profile over time is the climate. The atmosphere is a giant chimney that just cools it, not a greenhouse that warms it.  When doesn\u2019t it finish cooling it overnight, ready for the next sunrise?\nThe whole IPCC perversion of climate science needs to be sunk on a barge in the deepest part of the ocean and refounded sans any role for CO2.\nhttps://www.quora.com/How-does-the-increase-of-entropy-affect-the-environment/answer/TL-Winslow\nThe technology that Quaise Energy is working on would allow drilling down as far as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) to utilize heat from dry rock formations, which are much hotter and available in almost all parts of the world.\nNo drilling fluid to help offset the weight of the \u201cstem\u201d and supporting the weight takes the stresses at the \u201cplatform\u201d to around the ultimate strength of cold drawn steel (piano wire like) when cold. What happens when hot?\n\u201cImagine a microwave source on the surface, it\u2019s called a gyrotron. We beam this energy through a pipe into the hole. Together with this energy, we push a gas\u2014could be nitrogen, could be air, could be argon, if necessary\u2014and at the bottom of that pipe, this energy comes out, evaporates the rock, and the gas picks up the vapor of that rock and pulls it back out. What comes out of the hole looks like volcanic ash, and the hole actually burns its way down, you know, five, six, 10, 15, 20 kilometers, as needed, to get to the temperatures we\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nYeah, just drill really deep holes anywhere, right next to the \u201cclosed coal-fired station\u201d for example, and you have an instant source of free fuel.\nThe fundamental physics behind the technology has been proven, now Quaise Energy is moving from the lab to installing a prototype in the field.\nNot proven or at least not much of the totally of what has to be proven.\nIn the mid-1970s there were scientists telling people that 500F water was available beneath every surface hot springs or fumerole. Well, a bit of heat transport modelling (I admit to having been one of those modelers) in permeable media will suggest that this is not the case \u2014 that in fact the fluids at depth are likely not much hotter than what one observes at the surface. Rarely is there likely to be 500F water anywhere within drilling reach. We know where most of these places are and they are already developed or never likely to be (Yellowstone). Eventually these experts stopped telling people their fantasy. The revised fantasy is that we simply need to drill deeper.\nWhat we are looking at here is just \u201cbargaining\u201d. What step in the grief stage is bargaining?\n\u201cWalk toward the fire.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the introduction of the WEZ led to a 4.9% decline in road traffic flows in the new congestion charge area. These results are robust to different model specifications. HGVs traffic did not significantly change post-WEZ, which indicates that their road demand is price inelastic. The removal of the WEZ led to no significant variations in traffic. This result indicates asymmetry in behaviour with persistent changes in post-intervention traffic demand levels.\nCopyright:  \u00a9 2021 Ouali et al.

In the US, they have doubled since 2000 to reach an estimated $166 billion in 2017 [1]. In addition to causing economic losses through lost times, congestion can damage the environment and human health via increased vehicle emissions [2, 3]. These vehicle emissions include Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, which have been linked to increased child mortality and premature births [4, 5]. Negative effects associated with congestion have prompted governments to intervene by either increasing capacity or implementing demand management tools such as taxes, driving restrictions and subsidies. However, these policies can result in increased traffic volumes through induced demand, which limits their efficiency [6, 7].\nSince its first introduction in Singapore in 1975, congestion charging has been trialled in various cities including Stockholm, Gothenburg and London [8]. The underlying principle of congestion charging is to internalise the social costs of using the road in the price. Following that principle, each road user should be charged for the disbenefit caused by their contribution to congestion which results in considerable social welfare improvements [9, 10].\nPrevious congestion charge scheme studies mostly assess the responses to their introduction: most empirical analyses show that congestion charging is associated with a decline in both congestion, traffic volumes, accidents and air pollution [11\u201315]. However, congestion charge removals have received much less attention in the literature. Some studies find that congestion charge removals were followed by a \u201chysteresis effect\u201d, i.e. individuals go back to the way they used to travel once the program ceases to exist. In the cases studied, e.g. the Stockholm 2006 trial [12, 16], this hysteresis effect is likely to have been observed because the congestion charge was quickly removed after its implementation. However, these local studies do not use causal inference methods, and mostly follow a general travel framework [17\u201319].\nTo our knowledge, there are currently no papers jointly studying the implementation and removal of a congestion charge yet. The present paper aims to bridge that gap and to contribute to the literature by providing a complete analysis of the different stages of a congestion charge scheme. This enables us to test whether the implementation and removal of a congestion charge have symmetric effects, which is crucial in informing policymakers on the consequences of alterations that can be made to these programs. In analysing responses to the implementation and removal of a congestion charge scheme, we also can understand both the immediate short-run effects of the congestion charge and the long-lasting effects of road pricing.\nIt is not possible to know a priori responses to the withdrawal of a congestion charge. Two opposite effects are at play: firstly, the removal of the congestion charge reduces the costs of travelling by car, which incentivises car use and can, in turn, increase traffic volumes. However, the presence of the congestion charge for a certain amount of time in London is likely to induce a salient decrease in driving habits as individuals shifted away from using cars to avoid additional costs since the scheme started. Therefore, in the long run, changes in habits could present themselves in the form of a decrease in car ownership. Previous studies have shown that the long-run effects of pricing tend to outweigh the short-run effects [20], which highlights that transport decisions triggered by financial disincentives can evolve over time. Therefore, it is crucial to test whether the reduction in the costs of travelling by car mentioned above are a substantial financial incentive to travel by car once habits have shifted after years of car ownership disincentives.\nAnother contribution of the present analysis is in the choice of the identification strategy. In this paper, we use causal inference methods which allow us to quantify behavioural responses to changes in the congestion charge scheme and enable us to pinpoint precisely individuals\u2019 channel of response.\nIn this study, we analyse responses to the introduction and the removal of the Western Expansion Zone of the London congestion charge. The initial London congestion charge zone was expanded westwards in 2007 and then removed in 2010 following successive political shifts. The unanticipated nature of these events makes them suitable quasi-natural experiment candidates [21]. This enables us to quantify responses to road traffic management policies in terms of traffic flow. We perform separate analyses to uncover differentiated responses by transport modes. Our identification strategy uses a causal inference methodology (difference-in-differences estimation, DiD) which allows us to quantify behavioural responses cleared of time and location effects. We use the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for Transport (DfT) Annual Average Traffic Flow (AADF) panel data for Greater London. AADF data record traffic flows for seven transport modes: cars and taxis, buses and coaches, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), light goods vehicles (LGVs) and motorcycles. This allows us to explore the causal effects of the WEZ successively on personal, commercial and public transport. Additional regressions exploit manual traffic count data for Greater London produced by the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC).\nOur results show that the introduction of the WEZ led to a 4.9% decline in road traffic flows for all motor vehicles in the new congestion charge area. However, the traffic volume of HGVs did not significantly change post-WEZ, which implies their road demand is price inelastic. In contrast, we record no significant changes in traffic after the WEZ is removed. Results are robust to different specifications, to placebo tests and buffer tests. Therefore, estimates suggest that responses to the successive implementation and the removal of a congestion charge are not symmetric. After the implementation of a congestion charge, individuals are disincentivised to use their car in the new WEZ area as the costs of travelling by car in this zone increase. The lack of significant change post-removal seems to indicate that road pricing triggers long-run changes in travel behaviour that persist beyond the policy period. However, the withdrawal of a congestion charge increases financial incentives to use one\u2019s car, yet this incentive might be marginal and insufficient to trigger a significant behavioural change.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 and 3 review respectively the institutional background and the existing empirical literature on the CC. Section 4 describes our difference-in-differences method. Section 5 presents the data, and Section 6 presents the results, their discussion and robustness checks. Section 7 concludes.\nFollowing a program of extensive analysis and planning [22, 23], the London congestion charge (CC) was first introduced in 2003. Its main official objectives were to (i) reduce congestion, (ii) improve journey time reliability, (iii) increase the quality of the bus system and (iv) provide income for the maintenance and development of the underground [24].\nThe original London CC zone used the Inner Ring Road as its boundary. The charge levied in 2003 amounted to \u00a35 per vehicle between 07:00 and 18:30 every weekday (with the exclusion of public holidays) payable on the day either online, by phone or text message. Despite the possibility of getting weekly, monthly or yearly passes, discounts were not available. Failing to comply to the CC scheme led to a \u00a380 penalty [25]. Discounted fees existed (e.g., a 90% reduction in the fee for residents). Vehicle types exempted from the charge are the following: (i) motorbikes and mopeds; (ii) buses and coaches licensed in the DVLA \u2018bus class\u2019, (iii) London taxis; (iv) emergency service vehicles (e.g., police vehicles, ambulances). In addition, Blue Badge holders, NHS staff and patients and fire fighters are also exempted from the CC fee. In addition, alternative fuel vehicles (e.g., hybrid vehicles, vehicles over 3.5 tonnes that meet at least Euro III emissions standards, light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes meeting emissions standards 40% above Euro IV standards) and electric vehicles had to pay only an annual \u00a310 charge.\nSince its first introduction, the London CC scheme has undergone several changes (see Fig 1 for a timeline), of which the most important is its westward extension. Plans to extend the central congestion zone westwards were first discussed in August 2004. The proposed extension into Kensington and Chelsea was deemed practical and workable as this area presents public transport alternatives for individuals and is also subject to continuous congestion [26]. In addition, charging hours were reduced by 30 minutes from 6:30pm to 6:00 pm. The WEZ covers an area of 17 km2, comparable in size to the original CC zone and includes most of the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea boroughs. Note that detailed maps of the congestion charge area are available at:http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/transportandstreets/western_extension_congestion_charging_leaflet.pdf. The WEZ operated as a single congestion zone with the rest of the initial London congestion charge zone, with a toll of \u00a38 since 2005. London also had uncharged roads that provided an alternative for people who wished to avoid the tax and only wanted to cross central London rather than enter the zone.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.g001\nThe anticipated benefits of the extension were a 5 to 10% traffic volume reduction in charging hours alongside a 10\u201320% decrease in congestion [27]. Yet, this expansion was met with mixed reactions as some argued that the economic case for WEZ was weak [28]. The western expansion of the London CC zone became operational on February 19, 2007 and was removed on December 24th, 2010.\nA strand of literature studies the nature of responses to the implementation of a congestion charge [29]. To our knowledge, all of these studies find a significant decrease in traffic intensity in places where congestion charging is introduced. Traffic entering and leaving the London CC zone decreased by respectively 18% and 21% after its implementation [30] and that inbound trips to central London made by private cars reduced by 33% [24]. Other studies observing responses to the implementation of the WEZ find that the traffic reduced by 5.6% in roads within 5km of the WEZ boundary [31]. However, unlike our study, they do not control for time-varying borough characteristics which implies that responses might be subject to biases. In another WEZ study, the introduction led to a 14% reduction in four or more wheeled vehicles entering the zone (TfL, 2008) which is less than 30% attributed to the London CC scheme. Previous analyses suggest three reasons for this: (i) drivers who already pay the CC were not affected, (ii) the discount for residents increased the attractiveness to drive personal vehicles, and (iii) the WEZ has a greater proportion of residents who drive [32]. Responses are not only measured using traffic flows as outcomes and show that the London CC scheme led to a reduction in NOx and other emissions in the CC zone and an increase in the surrounding areas [11, 13]. However, estimates still fail to fully capture the environmental effects of the CC as other factors (e.g., advancements in engine technology) will also have affected pollution levels [33].\nAs mentioned previously, a significant decrease in traffic volume is unanimously observed after the implementation of a congestion charge. This implies that individuals respond in shifting their travel decisions towards other routes and towards other transport modes. After its initial implementation in London, the number of potentially chargeable vehicle kilometres reduced by 25% while the number of non-chargeable vehicle kilometres increased by 18%, which imply that individuals are incentivised to travel at earlier or later times in order to avoid paying the toll [34].\nThe implementation of a CC scheme also led to changes in the choice of transport mode, with studies showing that responses are of all the trips that were no longer made in central London, around half transferred to a form of public transport, a quarter avoided the CC zone, and 10% shifted to other forms of private transport [35]. In addition, the literature finds that combined effects on traffic volumes and public transport patronage enabled the CC to reduce congestion by around 30% during charging hours in the corresponding zone [35]. Other estimations indicate that the CC led to a 37% increase in bus passengers, half of whom were displaced from cars according to their estimations [30]. However, there has been a general increase in bus patronage across London [36], which might indicate that the aforementioned estimated effects might be overestimated. Other evidence nuances the aforementioned results by arguing that this response is likely to be a one off-shock [37]. Yet, all the aforementioned studies indicate that the WEZ led to substitution effects across transportation modes, with commuters shifting to other travel modes. Finally, the congestion charge implemented in Milan is found to lead to a major shift to other transport modes (such as motorbikes) which limited the positive impact of the policy [38].\nThis shift would ideally lead to a reduction in the volume of traffic and congestion. Descriptive statistics indicate that the WEZ and the area surrounding it experienced an increase in congestion; however, they could be attributed to road works which effectively reduced road capacity [39]. This result underlines the necessity to use causal inference tools to measure and precisely quantify responses to the implementation of a congestion charge in a new area.\nMost studies assess responses after a CC scheme is implemented. However, less attention has been paid to the reduction and/or the complete removal of a congestion charge. Overall, studies of responses to the removal of a CC indicate that the duration of the removal and whether it is permanent or temporary affect the nature of responses. Responses to removals appear to be milder than responses to the implementation of a CC.\nStudies of responses to the successive implementation and withdrawal of the six-month CC trial carried out in Stockholm find that traffic reduced by about 22% during the trial and then increased almost completely back to its original pre-trial level after the removal and remained only slightly lower than the pre-policy stage [40]. They attribute this slight reduction in traffic post-trial to major roadworks on a central bridge, which leads them to the conclusion that introducing and removing a CC induces symmetrical responses. However, this trial only lasted for less than a year, and individuals also knew that this trial was temporary, implying that this policy did not last long enough to alter travel behaviour determinants (e.g., car ownership), leading individuals to return to their previous travel habits once the trial ended.\nA congestion charge was implemented since 2008 in Milan, but was then suspended for 50 days in 2012. This event is a good candidate for a quasi-experimental analysis as it was unanticipated and happened for political reasons. Moreover, the temporary suspension had no significant effect on the overall traffic flow [38]. Yet, they find a shift in travel modes as the flows of polluting cars increased whereas flows of hybrid and electric cars decreased. This indicates that a short-term removal of a congestion charge is not likely to lead to neither important responses nor symmetrical to the implementation of a congestion charge.\nSimilarly in Trondheim, the toll cordon was removed in 2005 after 15 years of operation, providing an opportunity to analyse responses to a permanent withdrawal of a congestion charge. This removal led to a 12% increase in traffic during charging hours as commuters moved their trip times back to the former charging hours [41]. This is evidenced by an additional 10% decrease in traffic over uncharged hours. These results imply that permanent CC removals lead to more substantial changes in behaviour than temporary ones.\nWe use a difference-in-differences methodology (DiD) to identify causal responses to the introduction and the removal of the WEZ. We rely on the assumption that the WEZ reforms were not anticipated by individuals. As car ownership entail sunk costs including an important fixed upfront cost, we assume that car purchases and habits would not have changed until the financial incentives are implemented. Fig 2 indicates no clear anticipation behaviour of our groups, but this assumption is further tested in the Robustness Checks section. We also posit that the trend in the treatment and the control group would have been the same in the absence of the treatment [42]. We test the conditional parallel trend via a placebo test in section 6.4.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.g002\nIn this study,  is a dummy equal to 1 if the date t \u2265 2007, which is the year at which the WEZ was introduced, and zero otherwise. Similarly,  is a dummy equal to 1 if the date t \u2265 2010, which is the year at which the WEZ was removed, and zero otherwise.\nWe do not use transform outcomes into logs in the DiD specifications in order to keep the observations that are equal to 0: this may arise for some streets that can see no traffic at certain times, such as no cars, or no motorbikes.\nCount point fixed effects control for the volume of traffic observed as it can be impacted by both road characteristics (e.g., number of lanes) and borough characteristics (e.g., population, rate of employment). Controlling for population density and employment rate controls whether the area is residential or more of an office district. We control for time trends to account for temporal traffic trends such as the general increase in bus patronage [36]. Fuel price controls are also added in the specification in order to account another determinant of the intensity of car usage.\nOur coefficient of interest in the DiD estimation is \u03c4 which quantifies the effect of the treatment\u2014that is the introduction or the removal of the WEZ\u2014on the the treated roads that are located in the WEZ area. Following the findings from the literature, we can expect \u03c4 < 0 after the introduction of the WEZ since the implementation of the WEZ provides a financial incentive to drivers to shift to more sustainable transport modes that are exempt from the charge. Conversely, we expect a negative or potentially insignificant \u03c4 after the WEZ was removed since drivers might revert back to their pre-WEZ behaviour. However, financial incentives embedded in the removal remain small, which implies that the increase in car flows might be insignificant.\nTo perform this analysis, we use Annual Average Daily Flow (AADF) data produced by the UK Department for Transport (DfT). This dataset records information on traffic levels and road characteristics for 2,991 count points in London over the years 2006\u20132012\u2014including 991 points in the treated area\u2014and totalling 12,827 observations. Each observation contains information for a given street for an average day of a given year, namely the number of vehicles travelling past a specific count point in both directions. Traffic flows are counted for each of the following transport modes: \u201ccars and taxis\u201d, \u201cbuses and coaches\u201d, heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), light goods vehicles (LGVs), and the total four-wheeled vehicles (categorised as \u201call motor vehicles\u201d).\nCars and taxis are not split in the dataset, which implies that we cannot separate the responses of each vehicle type to the introduction and removal of the WEZ in our analysis. We acknowledge that this category contains both treated (cars) and untreated (taxis) vehicles. S1 Table presents mode shares for London and shows that including the cars and taxis section is crucial as they represent the majority of vehicles on roads. Yet, the analysis of the incentives contained in WEZ policies for respectively cars and taxis imply that the presence of a joined group does not impair the quality of the insights provided in our analysis. The implementation of the WEZ generates negative financial incentives for cars; as such, we expect cars\u2019 traffic flows to decrease for cars post-WEZ. However, taxis are not subject to these negative financial incentives: therefore, we expect the flow of taxis in streets to remain constant or to increase in case individuals substantially shift their modes of transport from cars to taxis post-WEZ. At first, expected effects could be ambiguous\u2014however, we still expect a negative coefficient for the group \u201ccars and taxis\u201d. This implies then that we capture a lower bound effect, and this does not undermine our assessment of significant responses.\nFig 2 presents annual average traffic flows for all motor vehicles in both treated (WEZ) and control (non-WEZ) groups. The introduction of the WEZ appears to lead to a greater traffic decline in the treated group as traffic levels decreased more in the WEZ area. The WEZ removal appears to have caused a smaller traffic reduction in traffic in the treated group compared to the control group. These descriptive statistics indicate also that there is initial support in favour of the common trend hypothesis.\nFinally, we complement the aggregate nature of our data by using Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) data. The data consists of raw traffic counts collected annually from different count points in London between 8 and 9 am. The raw traffic counts were carried out on roughly the same day every year which controls for seasonal trends and each observation has a specific date. We apply the model to this data and the results are presented in S5 and S6 Tables. We find that neither the introduction nor the removal had a significant effect on the volume of traffic. We attribute this to the inelastic nature of trips made during rush hour which are usually work related.\nS2 and S3 Tables present difference-in-means results for the introduction and removal of the WEZ respectively. To do so, we calculate the average change between the pre and post treatment period in the control and treatment groups and differentiate the two to compute the difference-in-means. Estimates indicate that the WEZ led to a decline in traffic for all modes affected by the WEZ, which provides preliminary evidence in favour of the efficacy of the WEZ. The insignificant change in HGVs might exhibit inelastic demand.\nEstimates in S4 Table represent traffic responses after the WEZ was introduced. Results indicate a significant decrease in the number of vehicles for all modes subject to congestion charging, with the exception of HGVs. This confirms the initial difference-in-means results. The coefficient attached to cars and taxis is negative and significant, which indicates that the negative financial incentives embedded in the WEZ policy encouraged a considerable decrease in car use that the potential increase in taxis did not mitigate. In order to better understand the magnitude of responses, we calculate demand elasticities. To do so, we re-estimate the model in Eq (1) using natural logarithms of traffic flows. This allows the computation of percentage changes as follows: exp(coefficient) \u2212 1 = Changein% (see Table 1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.t001\nEstimates show that overall, motor vehicles flows decline by 4.9% in the Western Zone extension area after the extension of the congestion charge area. This is smaller than the value of 14% reported in previous studies [30] but remains comparable to the 5.6% decline in more recent reports [31]. Cars and taxis decreased by 5.1%. This is much lower than TfL\u2019s (2008) estimate of -22% for cars and might be caused by the fact that taxis, that are exempted from constraint, saw their flow increase post-WEZ. Yet, our estimates tend to validate more previous studies\u2019 conclusions [28, 30], namely that the Western expansion did not meet its target of a 13% reduction in total vehicle traffic.\nWe also find a 6.7% decrease in LGVs, which is similar to 7% estimate previously found [39]. Unlike LGVs, HGVs flows did not significantly vary after the introduction of the WEZ. This can be explained by the fact that HGVs are mostly used for commercial purposes and constitute a category of vehicles which tend to exhibit an inelastic demand [43].\nWe do not record any change in traffic volumes for buses and coaches post-WEZ implementation, which is unsurprising since they were exempt from the charge, and the increase in bus patronage have been accounted for in the trend and year fixed effects. In addition, the number of buses is determined by the timetables, not directly by passenger demand. More broadly, results suggest that the decline in traffic flows is smaller than the 30% decrease recorded after the London CC scheme was implemented in 2003. The reduced sensitivity might be explained by the fact that the WEZ covers a smaller zone compared to the 2003 CC zone. Thus, the smaller decline might have occurred since only a third of the traffic entering the zone was expected to pay the CC [44].\nEstimates in Table 2 below show that the removal of the WEZ had no significant effect on overall traffic, which is in line with previous studies [31]. This validates even further the results in the literature as our results have more power and all our specifications account for fixed effects. In contrast, HGV traffic flows increase by a significant 20% post removal of the WEZ, which indicates that these vehicles are not sensitive to financial disincentives but significantly respond to financial incentives\u2014in this case, a reduction in costs.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.t002\nOur results differ from the previous significant 14.5% increase in traffic volume found after the road pricing scheme in Milan got temporarily suspended [45]. As such, our results might be explained by the fact that the WEZ lasted longer than the CC schemes in Stockholm and Milan. For instance, the CC withdrawal occurred in Stockholm 6 months after its implementation, whereas the WEZ lasted substantially longer (4 years), leaving individuals a time window large enough to significantly change their travel attitudes in a way that would affect the determinants of car usage (e.g., car ownership). However, after the WEZ was removed, individuals who wanted to shift back to their pre-WEZ travel habits had to face new costs generated by the car ownership and maintenance (e.g., insurance costs).\nWe compute placebo tests to verify the validity of the common trend assumption [46]. We chose to not use a lags and leads specification as a robustness check because of the existence of other little events for some years (see Fig 1) that would have potentially biased the results. The aim of this test is to show that pre-treatment data presents a clear trend, which can then be applied to the post-reform period. Placebo tests involve checking the existence of a treatment effect on traffic by changing the date of the reform. For the WEZ implementation (respectively removal), the analysis will be repeated using only pre-treatment (respectively post-treatment) years and an arbitrary treatment year will be selected from these. The specification follows Eq (1) with the implementation date being now Ti = 2006 and Tr = 2011. In other words, since the treatment has not been dispensed, we do not expect to find an effect on the treated group post-treatment.\nTable 3 and S7 Table present placebo tests results respectively for the introduction and removal of the WEZ. Estimates are insignificant for all vehicle types subject to changes in road pricing, which is in line with the fact that the parallel trend hypothesis is verified and it is the treatment that is at the source of the response and that effects are not resulting from general trend effects.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.t003\nIn addition to this placebo test using different cutoff dates, we run additional regressions and change the count points that are to be included in the treatment area. We set the treatment a bit westward in a way that includes the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and also find null results for both the implementation and removal of the WEZ. This further confirms the robustness of the results. Finally, additional regressions have been performed using a two period DiD for respectively the introduction and removal, which yield similar results compared to what is obtained in Tables 1 and 2. This implies that the results are correctly identified by the multiple periods difference-in-differences methodology used in the present study.\nOne of the underlying DiD assumptions (see Section 4) is that treated units do not interact with untreated units. To verify this hypothesis, we perform a buffer test following [31]. To implement the buffer test, we perform the previous analysis following Eqs 1 and 2 while removing count points within 500m of the WEZ boundary. Table 4 presents the buffer test results after the WEZ was introduced. This test indicates that our results are robust since the DiD estimates are of a similar magnitude and sign.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.t004\nResults from this study have thus far suggested that the introduction of a CC scheme appears to lead to a significant and substantial reduction in the volume of traffic for most modes of travel, with the largest response being recorded for cars. An important finding is that the introduction and the removal of a congestion charge in a given area do not have symmetrical effects. More precisely, removing a CC appears to have no significant effects on traffic. This suggests that individuals, to some extent, maintain the travel behaviours they adopted under the presence of a congestion charge. These results show that a policy which temporarily implements a CC can cause a lasting shift in travel behaviour decisions under the condition that the withdrawal is unanticipated. This confirms previous evidence from Stockholm [40] that the \u201ctemporary\u201d implementation of the CC led to a reduction in traffic that persisted even when it was removed. These results generate policy implications since despite their subsequent removal, CC zones are expected to continuously reduce traffic through making driving less attractive.\nThis paper quantifies traffic responses after the introduction and the removal of a congestion charge on traffic volume using a difference-in-difference (DiD) methodology. Results indicate that the introduction of the WEZ led to significant responses, with a 4.9% decline in the total volume of traffic and a 5.1% decline in car traffic in the WEZ area. Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) did not significantly change their travel patterns, which might be explained by their price inelastic demand for road use. Further analysing responses to the removal of WEZ show that responses to the implementation and withdrawal of the WEZ are not symmetrical. Estimates recording changes in traffic volumes are insignificant for all vehicles subject to the change in policy. The withdrawal of a congestion charge increases financial incentives to use one\u2019s car, yet this incentive might be marginal and not sufficient for individuals to increase their propensity to change their car use to an extent that makes a substantial difference in terms of traffic flows. Therefore, the change in behaviour after a congestion charge is implemented is likely to be sustained even after this policy is withdrawn. Results are robust to different specifications, placebo tests and buffer tests.\nMore broadly, our results indicate that congestion charging lead to a persistent change in aggregate travel demand levels even after the removal of the CC. Our results provide grounds for policy intervention in favour of the implementation of a congestion charge since they tend to have lasting effects that persist even after its withdrawal.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s002\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s003\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s004\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s006\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253881.s007\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback."

We propose a methodology to identify authors with multiple affiliations co-hosted by two organizations for a prolonged period of time, which distinguishes them from authors who change jobs or only hold short appointments. We apply this methodology to all authors and organizations residing in the Netherlands and find 626 organizations with at least one co-affiliated researcher. We perform a regression analysis of the inter-organizational network spanned by all co-affiliated researchers, and find strong negative effects of travel time. We also find that researchers who hold multiple affiliations, often cross the institutional boundaries between university, industry, government, healthcare and public research organizations. In particular, university-affiliated researchers tend to be most active in bridging to organizations in other institutional spheres. We end with some reflections for future studies and implications for science policy.\nCopyright:  \u00a9 2021 Yegros-Yegros et al.

Its study led to a vast literature covering various research traditions, all interested in unravelling patterns of collaboration in scientific research (for a recent review, see Hall et al. [1]). Research collaboration generates benefits in several ways, inter alia, through sharing of data, resources, equipment and ideas as well as wider exposure of research outcomes to multiple audiences [2, 3]. For these reasons, nurturing research collaboration has always been high on science policy agendas, not just at national levels, but also at transnational levels such as the European Union and beyond [4, 5].\nResearch collaboration is generally approached from the angle of collaboration among researchers in team science. A much less developed, yet complementary perspective is to analyze research collaboration from the angle of collaborating organizations. If inter-organizational collaboration would only involve researchers tied to a single organization, the inter-organizational analysis of collaboration would simply be the logical complement of the intra-organizational analysis of team science. However, organizations also connect in other ways, notably, by employing the same individual holding multiple affiliations.\nThere have only been a few studies on researchers with multiple affiliations, also referred to as multi-institutional co-authorship [6\u20139]. Given the scant systematic research, we know very little about the phenomenon of researchers with multiple affiliations. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon is not just of academic interest but may also carry important policy implications [10]. In particular, researchers holding multiple affiliations may serve as key pathways through which heterogeneous organizations can coordinate research and exchange knowledge, for example, in \u2018mode 2\u2019 type of knowledge production [11] and \u2018triple-helix\u2019 type of collaboration [12]. Since more formalized collaborations would be more difficult to establish when organizations have conflicting missions operating in different institutional sectors [13], researchers that are affiliated to multiple organization can function as \u2018bridging persons\u2019. Multiple research environments provide bridging researchers with a unique position to connect research groups, also known as \u2018structural folds\u2019 in social network theory [14].\nIn this study, we develop a systematic methodology to identify researchers with multiple affiliations from bibliometric data and apply a proximity framework to analyze empirically the drivers underlying inter-organizational collaborations spanned by researchers with multiple affiliations. We apply our framework to all authors with multiple affiliations in the Netherlands using data from Web of Science for the period 2016\u20132018. We limit our analysis to researchers co-affiliated with Dutch organizations, leaving out international co-affiliations. Our main quest is to analyze to what extent authors holding multiple affiliations domestically are not just bridging different organizations per se, but different institutional sectors. We distinguish not only the \u2018triple helix\u2019 of the university, industry and government sectors [12], but also the sectors of healthcare and Public Research Organizations. Using regression analysis, we analyze to what extent researchers with multiple affiliations bridge organizations in these five institutional spheres, overcoming the tendency for \u2018institutional proximity\u2019 in research collaboration [13].\nThree key empirical findings regarding researchers with multiple affiliations are: (i) they are most prevalent among organizations with geographical, cognitive and organizational proximity, (ii) they typically cross the boundaries of institutional sectors, serving as bridging persons in the research system, and (iii) the university sector is most prominent in connecting with other institutional sector reflecting universities\u2019 central role in the Dutch national research system.\nWe proceed as follows. We start with a review of the studies on researchers with multiple affiliations. We then develop a proximity framework to analyze researchers with multiple affiliations, followed by the description of the data collection and statistical methods and the discussion of the empirical results. We close with some concluding remarks.\nSeveral bibliometric studies have investigated authors with multiple affiliations. In this context, the distinction between collaboration at the author level and the organizational level was noted early on [2]. While single-authored papers do not reflect any collaboration between authors, an indication of multiple affiliations by a single author in the address field nevertheless reflects an inter-organizational collaboration.\nOnly recently, however, the phenomenon of multiple-affiliation authors has been subject of empirical research, boosted by the improved availability of data in bibliographic databases. Hottenrott and Lawson [6] first explored this phenomenon in Germany, Japan and the UK, looking at the fields of biology, chemistry, and engineering during the period 2008\u20132014. They found that the share of authors with multiple affiliations rose from five percent in 2008 to 10 percent in 2014, indicating a doubling in just six years. They also found that authors with multiple affiliations are more often found in highly-cited papers, particularly in the case of authors from Japan and Germany in the fields of biology and chemistry.\nIn a more recent study, Hottenrott et al. [9] increased the coverage by looking at 14 disciplines and 40 countries for the period 1996\u20132019, based on 20.5 million articles listed in Scopus. In the final year of the analysis (2019), almost one in three articles was (co-)authored by authors with multiple affiliations. Over the whole period, the share of authors with multiple affiliations increased from 6.7 to 11.8 percent. The growth of multiple affiliations is prevalent in all disciplines and it is stronger in high impact journals. They further found that multiple affiliations are more frequent in a university setting, as roughly half of all multiple affiliations involved either two universities or a university and a public research organization. In terms of geography, they found that the growth of multiple affiliations is mainly related to domestic affiliations.\nThree more studies on researchers on multiple affiliations focused on their citation impact. Sanfilippo et al. [8] looked at 27,612 articles published in Science, Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and PLOS Biology for the years 2010 and 2014. In agreement with previous research, they found that citations grow with the number of co-authors. They further observed an increase in average citations when authors with multiple affiliations were listed as an author. Huang and Chang [7] analyzed the relationship between multiple affiliations and citation impact in the fields of genetics and high-energy physics in the period 2008 to 2013. They found a citation premium for authors with multiple affiliations only for high-energy physics. Finally, Tong et al. [15] looked at many more disciplines and further distinguished between authors with multiple affiliations within and across countries. Their results show that multiple affiliations within a country are associated with higher citation impact in medical and biological fields, while multiple affiliations across countries are associated with higher citation impact in space science, geosciences and mathematics. However, the causal mechanism remains unclear, as the creation of connections between multiple organizations can lead to more citation impact, but at the same time may high-impact authors be invited more often to hold multiple affiliations.\nIn general, extant studies point to a rise in multiple affiliations, with the most recent study by Hottenrott et al. [9] estimating that close to 12 percent of researchers currently list multiple affiliations in publications. It should be noted, however, that the identification of co-affiliated researchers relies on bibliometric data. The methodologies applied so far count anyone who lists multiple affiliations in a publication as a co-affiliated author. As a result, the numbers of co-affiliated authors should not be taken to refer only to researchers who are simultaneously employed, but may also include external PhD students listing their university of training, researchers employed by one organization but visiting another organization, or mobile researchers who switched jobs but still list the former employer.\nResearchers holding multiple affiliations connect the organizations they work for. The total set of such researchers thus spans an inter-organizational network. The interaction strength between any two organizations in the network is then given by the number of researchers that simultaneously hold an affiliation with both organizations. The total inter-organizational network provides one possible representation of the \u2018national innovation system\u2019 originally defined by Freeman as \u2018the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify, and diffuse new technologies\u2019 ([16], p. 1). Clearly, this is only one window on the innovation system as it only looks at individuals with multiple affiliations active in scientific research as visible in their publication landscape. Yet, this window may serve as a useful, indicative representation of the innovation system as one can assume that two organizations that employ the same individuals also collaborate and exchange knowledge in other ways.\nThe inter-organizational network as identified by counting the number of authors with multiple affiliations can then be analyzed in terms of its drivers. A common approach to explain inter-organizational networks is the \u2018proximity approach\u2019 [17\u201320] and subsequently applied empirically on science, technology and innovation networks [5, 13, 21\u201341].\nFollowing this framework, one explains the strength of inter-organizational links by the proximity between organizations in one or multiple dimensions. While the literature deals with proximity in different ways, we rely on the analytical distinctions proposed by Boschma [19], found in several empirical papers on research collaboration networks [5, 13, 26, 28, 35, 37, 40, 42]. While these studies looked to inter-organizational networks stemming from co-authorships or research consortia, our study investigates individuals with multiple affiliations.\nGeographical proximity between organizations is widely assumed to support collaboration because of the importance of face-to-face interaction to exchange tacit knowledge and coordinate complex projects. Geographical proximity is beneficial as it reduces the cost and time involved in travel. Indeed, it is a long-standing statistical finding that the intensity of scientific collaboration between organizations increases with geographical proximity (for a review, see Frenken et al. [43]). In the context of the present study on scientists with multiple affiliations, one can equally hypothesize that geographical proximity between organizations increases the chance of these organizations to jointly hire scientists. In particular, geographical proximity supports scientists to hold multiple affiliations as it reduces their commuting time as well as the travel time for participants from both organizations in joint meetings. Or, put reversely, one can expect that the number of collaborations declines as geographical distance increases.\nOur main interest in this study, however, lies in institutional proximity, which refers to the degree to which actors across organizations share similar formal and informal rules [44]. Following previous studies on research collaboration [13, 28, 37], we consider a binary classification whereby two organizations are institutionally proximate if they belong to the same institutional sphere (e.g., university, industry, government, etc.). In general, organizations are more prone to collaboration if they operate under similar institutions, as knowledge exchange and co-production is easier when norms and incentives are aligned [13, 45]. The facilitating role of common institutions in collaboration also explains why university-industry-government relations are so complex to govern [11, 12]. Without a common \u2018institutional logic\u2019, it can be challenging for researchers working under a different institutional logic, to overcome conflicts of norms, values and incentives. An exception can be some of the public research organizations that combine missions (scientific knowledge production, industry support, promoting health, safeguarding heritage, etc.), aptly labelled \u2018hybrid organization\u2019 [46].\nWhile organizational routines tend to be aligned with the institutional sphere that they are part of, individual researchers can be more flexible by assuming different roles in different contexts [47]. From this perspective, for a single person it may be easier to cross institutional boundaries than for organizations as a whole. In particular, a single person can fulfil the role of a bridging person between heterogeneous organizations and can be specifically instructed and governed to do so [48]. For example, as institutionalized in some countries including the Netherlands, a university can employ part-time professors (\u2018extraordinary professor\u2019) from the industry to connect the research of both organizations or, reversely, allow its full-time professors to take up part-time jobs outside academia [49]. Hence, one can expect that geographical proximity between organizations supports collaboration given the practical benefit of lower travel time, one would not expect institutional proximity between organizations to drive multiple affiliations per se.\nThe identification of authors indicating multiple affiliations is based on scientific publications retrieved from the CWTS in-house version of the Web of Science. We retrieved all publications between 2016 and 2018 in which at least one of the authors indicated two or more institutional affiliations in the Netherlands. This criterion thus excludes researchers who hold a second affiliation in a foreign organization. To identify unique researchers among the authors indicating multiple affiliations in the Netherlands, we rely on an author name disambiguation algorithm developed by Caron and van Eck [50]. This algorithm not only looks at the similarity between author names in different publications to determine whether the publications were produced by the same researcher, but also makes use of additional information extracted from various fields of the bibliographic record in the database, such as institutional affiliation, fields of science where the publication has been classified or the e-mail address. By using this algorithm, we were able to assign publications to unique researchers.\nMost of the names of the organizations indicated as institutional affiliations were harmonized using the CWTS database of organizations. The names of the organizations not included in CWTS\u2019s database were harmonized manually. Affiliations indicated in a given publication should refer to different organizations. Co-affiliation with two departments within the same organizations (e.g., department of law and department of economics in the same university) are discarded. If two organizations are branches of an umbrella-type of organization, such as branches of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) or Shell, we consider these as separate organizations as such branch tend to operate quite independently being specialized in a certain domain.\nIn this study we focused on recent years and imposed one additional criterion to classify an author as holding multiple affiliations. We selected only authors who published at least one publication in 2016 and at least another publication in 2018, indicating the same multiple affiliations in all the publications. We used this criterion to make sure that authors have two appointments simultaneously for a prolonged period. Considering multiple affiliations during only one year would instead increase the chances of including researchers who have been on sabbatical, enjoying a visiting position in a host organization [2, 6], or researchers that changed jobs and in some articles listed both the affiliation of the new employer and the former employer. Starting from a set of 4,139 researchers with at least one publication indicating more than one affiliations in the Netherlands in 2016, we end up with a final sample of 2,828 researchers co-affiliated to the same Dutch organizations both in 2016 and 2018. This restriction also means that our count of co-affiliated researchers is a conservative estimate. In particular, co-affiliated researchers who fail to publish in both years will not be identified.\nTo test the validity of our approach, we compared the nature of the multiple affiliations of researchers in our sample with those of the cases we excluded because the multiple-affiliation was only observed in 2016. Using publicly available sources, we manually checked the curriculum of a random set of 200 researchers, 100 drawn from the former group and 100 from the latter. We then classified researches into four categories: \u2018Formal co-affiliations\u2019 refer to the cases with genuine and prolonged multiple affiliations. This group includes individuals with part-time appointments in different organizations, as well as people who lead projects, hold consulting roles or board memberships in other organizations. The second category \u2018PhD and visiting\u2019 comprises researchers whose double affiliation is temporary and associated with a studying or training period. The third category is \u2018Mobile researchers\u2019 referring to people who changed job and are still listing their former employer in their publications. Finally, we have a residual group of researchers for which the available information was insufficient to classify them in any of the previous categories. Table 1 shows the results of this comparison.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t001\nThis exercise shows that publications constitute a rather noisy indicator of prolonged simultaneous appointments as the multiple affiliations on a paper can also be included for other reasons. Our method selecting only authors who published both in 2016 and 2018 with the same list of affiliations, does increase the share of true positives from 14 to 42 percent. On the one hand, this criterion reduces the chances of considering mobile researchers because it extends the period of observation. On the other hand, it discriminates less productive researchers who did not publish in 2018, possibly excluding multiple affiliations associated with studying or training purposes. Overall, this evidence supports the validity of our methodology as we are interested in the bridging role of researchers holding multiple formal affiliations for a prolonged period of time.\nFollowing these criteria, we obtain a network of 626 Dutch organizations that employ at least one researcher with multiple affiliations. Starting from this set of 626 organizations, we construct an inter-organizational network with (626*625)/2 = 195,625 unique organization pairs, called dyads. For each dyad, we count the number of co-affiliated researchers, which can be either 0 or some positive number. Note that authors who are co-affiliated with more than two organizations are counted multiple times (\u2018full counting\u2019). For example, an author who is affiliated with organization A, B and C will be treated in the same way as three authors, one with a double affiliation with organization A and B, one with A and C, and one with B and C. The dataset containing the unique organization pairs and the variables considered in the study is available in (S1 File).\nOut of the 195,625 dyads, there are 1,818 dyads (almost one percent) with at least one co-affiliated researcher. This sparse network shows that co-affiliation in the Netherlands\u2013as we measured it\u2013is not very common. As discussed before, however, the true number of co-affiliated researchers may well be higher as we used a quite strict criterion to identify co-affiliated researchers to avoid false positives.\nThe highest number of co-affiliated researchers between any two organizations is 179 (between the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and the Free University of Amsterdam), the second highest 115 (between the University of Amsterdam and the Free University of Amsterdam) and the third highest 106 (between the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and the University of Amsterdam).\nFig 1 shows the inter-organizational network as derived from our data on authors listing multiple affiliations. In the figure, we focus on the strongest links in the network showing only organizations with four or more co-affiliated researchers. The size of the node indicates the total number of publications of the organization in 2016 and 2018. It is clear from the network that the universities and university medical centers dominate the network. These organizations employ many researchers (as evident from the size of the nodes) and are well connected to many other organizations (as evident from the many links they have). Upon visual inspection, we can already see the role of geographical proximity as indicated by a cluster around the two Amsterdam-based universities and another large cluster around Utrecht University.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.g001\nSince we are dealing with count data, we follow [13, 25, 51] and opt for a non-linear specification. A common model applied to count data is Poisson regression, which uses maximum likelihood estimation. In this case, the distribution of the interaction intensity between i and j has a conditional mean \u03bc that is a function of the independent variables. More formally:\nTo correct for overdispersion and account for the excessive number of zero\u2019s in our dataset, we estimate a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. This specification allows for the presence of \u201cstructural\u201d zeros in the data that are produced by a different process than the remaining counts, it is therefore particularly appropriate in the estimation of gravity models [51]. In the context of this study, we suspect that most of the zero observations are simply due to the fact that most organizations have only a few researchers working for them. The estimation process therefore consists of two parts: the zero-inflated part is a logit model that estimates the zero observations, while the negative binomial part estimates the counts.\nWe operationalize the variables in the gravity equation as follows. The number of co-affiliated researchers is the dependent variable that reflects the intensity of interactions between organization i and organization j.\nThe number of publications produced by each organization in the years 2016 and 2018 is used as a proxy of the organization\u2019s size (i.e. mass). This number serves as an important control for the expected number of co-affiliated researchers as the larger two organizations are, the more likely they will have co-affiliated researchers, ceteris paribus.\nDistance in a gravity equation is to be understood as the opposite of proximity. The more two organizations are distant (here, in geographical and institutional senses), the lower the number of co-affiliated researchers that is expected.\nWe measure geographical distance between two organizations by the time required to travel form the municipality of organization i to the municipality of organization j. We choose travel time instead of geographical distance because travel time captures more precisely the travel costs involved, including the value of the time lost by travelling [52]. Travel times are computed as travel time by car, taken from the public data provided by Statistics Netherlands (www.cbs.nl).\nWe measure our main variable of interest, institutional proximity, as two organizations being active in the same institutional sector. We classify organizations included in one of the five following sectors: University, Industry, Government, Public Research Organization (PRO) and Health. Here, we assigned universities, university medical centers and poly-technical schools to \u2018University\u2019, firms and consultancies to \u2018Industry\u2019, ministries, municipalities and government agencies to \u2018Government\u2019, public research organizations (TNO, RIVM, KNMI, etc.) to \u2018PRO\u2019 and hospitals and clinics to \u2018Health\u2019. To indicate institutional proximity, we constructed a dummy that takes on 1 if two organizations belong to the same institutional sector, and 0 otherwise. Some organizations could not be classified in any of the five sectors and form a residual category, mainly consisting of various museums, NGOs and associations.\nQuite strikingly, over half of the organizations belong to the health sector (318, 50.8%), while the second largest group is the industry sector (129, 20.6%). The PRO (80, 12.8%) and university (64, 10.2%) sectors host relatively few organizations (but note that these tend to be large organizations hosting many researchers). Finally, the government sector is the smallest (22, 3.5%). An even smaller group was not classified and put in the residual category (13, 2.1%). It should be noted that the relative size of the health sector probably would be smaller and the relative size of the university sector larger [9], if our analysis would include international co-affiliations.\nFrom the classification, we constructed Fig 2, which is a copy of Fig 1 but now with colors to indicate the five different institutional sectors that we distinguish in our study. Recall that the network only shows the links between organizations with four or more co-affiliated researchers. The figure provides us, as a first rough impression, with an institutional mapping of the research system in terms of domestic co-affiliations. The university sector clearly dominates. This domination is interesting because, in the sheer number of organizations, the university sector is much smaller than the healthcare sector (mostly present at the left of the network). Furthermore, we see some PROs quite central in the network and only a few industry-organizations (mostly to the left) and only two government organizations.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.g002\nFinally, we include two control variables. First, we consider knowledge specialization in medical or engineering domain (using organizations\u2019 website). The medical domain mainly includes the university medical centers, hospitals, clinics, and pharmaceutical firms, while the engineering domains includes technical universities, TNO and industrial firms like Philips, Shell, Unilever and many others. One can expect that researchers with one affiliation specialized in medical (engineering) knowledge production is more likely to have the other affiliation also with an organization specialized in the medical (engineering) domain. We thus construct a dummy variable called \u2018Joint specialization\u2019 taking value of 1 if two organizations are specialized in the same knowledge domain (either medical or engineering), and 0 otherwise. We also control for organizations that represent two different locations from the same umbrella organization. Such umbrella organizations exist primarily for hospitals with regional branches and for TNO which is the national organization for applied research in the Netherlands with branches in different cities. To control for the possibility that researchers holding multiple affiliations may work for the same umbrella organization, we constructed a dummy that takes on 1 if two organizations belong to the same umbrella organization, and 0 otherwise. Table 2 summarizes all variables.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t002\nWe first provide the descriptive statistics of the variables that enter into the gravity equation. Table 3 reports the summary statistics, and Table 4 the correlations. Following the gravity equation, we use the log of the sizes and of the distances. We added 1 to travel time to allow for logarithmic transformation of observations with organizations located in the same municipality.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t003\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t004\nConcerning the number of co-affiliated researchers as the dependent variable, it is clear that the mean (0.03) is close to zero. The low mean is driven by an excessive number of zero values.\nTable 4 shows a very low correlation between the number of co-affiliated researchers and other variables. In line with the specification of the gravity model, our dependent variable is especially (positively) correlated with the organizations\u2019 size. It is further noteworthy that all other correlations are also very low, except for institutional proximity and joint specialization. This is primarily driven by the hospitals and clinics that are assigned both to the medical knowledge domain and the health institutional domain.\nTo analyze the effect of travel time and institutional proximity, we run zero-inflated negative binomial regressions. In the logit model, we include the product of organization sizes because we expect the excess zeros to be associated with organizations that are relatively small. In the negative binomial model, we estimate the effects of travel time and institutional proximity on the number of co-affiliated researchers between any two organizations, while also controlling for joint specialization and umbrella organizations, as well as for the size effects as we do in the zero-inflated part.\nModel 1 includes all variables and serves as the basic model to test whether travel time and institutional proximity matters in explaining co-affiliation. Model 2 includes the specific dummies of institutional proximity for each of the five institutional sectors (university, industry, government, PRO, health) to further unpack the institutional proximity variable. Finally, in Model 3 we add pairs of different institutional spheres, thus including \u2018institutional distance\u2019 next to institutional proximity. Here, we drop the Health-dummy, which is taken as the reference category.\nTable 5 reports the results of Model 1. Looking at the zero-inflated part, we see that\u2013as expected\u2013organization size decreases the chance to observe zero co-affiliated researchers (hence, the negative sign). This effect is highly significant. Looking at the negative binomial part, as expected, we also see a highly significant effect of size, with larger organizations having more co-affiliated researchers.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t005\nModel 1 shows that travel time decreases the chances of multiple affiliations as expected, a result that remains very stable in the later models. Interestingly, we find a negative effect of institutional proximity, which indicates that co-affiliated researchers tend to connect organizations from different institutional sector. This key finding shows the role of co-affiliated researchers as bridging persons overcoming the traditional biases in collaboration within institutional spheres as found in past studies on inter-organizational collaboration [13, 28, 37]. Finally, it is worth noting that the two variables controlling for joint specialization and umbrella organizations are positive and significant, as expected. These results remain very stable in the later models.\nTable 6 presents the results of Model 2 and Model 3. In Model 2, we unpack institutional proximity into five separate dummies denoting dyads of two universities, two industries, two governments, two PROs and two healthcare organizations, respectively. It becomes clear that institutional proximity does play a role for universities given the positive and significant effect of the University-dummy. We also observe a negative effect of institutional proximity for the PRO and Health dummy variables. The negative sign of the PRO-dummy indicates that very few people combine jobs at multiple PROs, which we understand to be driven by the specialized nature of research at PROs typically focused on one specific area of research (e.g, public health, weather, space, etc.). Similarly, the negative and significant sign of the Health-dummy indicates that co-affiliations between healthcare organizations are rather uncommon.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.t006\nIn Model 3, we add the dummies for institutional distances. In this way, we can analyze which specific institutional distances are bridged by co-affiliated researchers next to institutional proximities. It is worth noting the fit statistics as indicated by the BIC and AIC values that, while there is only a small improvement between Model 1 and Model 2, a much more substantial improvement is achieved when adding the sector combinations in Model 3.\nLooking at the coefficients of the institutional variables, we see a clear pattern: all the positive and significant variables involve a university organization. The coefficient for the University-dummy indicates that exp(1.52) = 4.57 more co-affiliations exist between universities than the baseline (Health). And, the effects of the other dummies involving a university are also sizeable: exp(1.54) = 4.66 more co-affiliations for university-PRO co-affiliations, exp(1.27) = 3.56 more co-affiliations for university-health co-affiliations, exp(1.14) = 3.13 more co-affiliations for university-government co-affiliations, and exp(0.94) = 2.56 more co-affiliations for university-industry co-affiliations. This shows that the university is the central type of organization connecting the entire research system through co-affiliations with industry, government, healthcare and PROs, as well as among universities themselves. However, given the large number of healthcare organizations, most of the bridging, in absolute terms, occur between universities and their medical centers with hospitals and clinics, mostly in the same region. Healthcare organizations, in turn, seem much less inclined to co-host researchers jointly with industry or PROs, reading from the negative and significant coefficients.\nThe number of researchers holding multiple affiliations has grown rapidly over the past few decades [9]. These co-affiliated researchers can play an important bridging role between organizations fostering knowledge transfer and research collaboration. Our study investigated to what extent travel distance and institutional proximity affect co-affiliations between organizations.\nWe proposed a new methodology to identify authors with multiple affiliations using a conservative approach to avoid false positives. Using Web of Science, we selected only authors with multiple affiliations with a publication in one year and at least another publication two years later indicating the same multiple affiliations, to ensure that authors have two appointments simultaneously for a prolonged time. Applying this methodology to all authors and organizations residing in the Netherlands, we found 626 organizations with at least one co-affiliated author.\nA regression analysis of the inter-organizational network in terms of co-affiliated researchers shows that travel time exerts a strong negative effect on the number of co-affiliated researchers between any two organizations. Institutional proximity, by contrast, has no significant effect in general indicating that co-affiliated researchers easily cross institutional boundaries between university, industry, government, PROs and healthcare organizations. This shows the role of co-affiliated researchers as \u2018bridging persons\u2019 within the research system. Further analysis showed that especially universities play a key role in overcoming institutional distances in the Dutch research system through many co-affiliations with industry, government, PRO and healthcare organizations.\nOur study is not without limitations. First, the study focuses on a single country: the Netherlands. We also choose to restrict the analysis of co-affiliations to organizations within the Netherlands. Even if most co-affiliations have been found to be located within countries [9], the patterns we found in this study may not be the same if we would have included international co-affiliations as well. In particular, it has been found that at the international level, co-affiliations between universities tend to dominate [9]. Furthermore, the results we found for the Netherlands may be different from the results that can be obtained for different countries. While there are strong theoretical reasons to assume that travel distance plays a role in any country, the results on institutional proximity may be more country-specific. In particular, the prime role of universities in the Dutch national research system may contrast with some other European countries where, historically, public research organizations have also played a major role [53]. Our methodology and regression approach can serve as a framework to characterize a national innovation system comparatively, pointing to the relative importance of travel distance and institutional proximities in each country [37]. A second issue to highlight holds that the identification of co-affiliated researchers has been based on a conservative algorithm. Our restriction to authors who publish in one year as well as two years later listing the same affiliations discards some researchers with short contracts as well as authors who publish only irregularly. Yet, we deem our conservative methodology appropriate in avoiding many false positives that stem from researchers that switch job while still listing the former employee.\nFrom a policy evaluation point of view, the role of researchers with multiple affiliations deserves more interest. On the one hand, these individuals can play a key role, in particular, in bridging institutional spheres that otherwise may have limited inter-organizational interaction due to incongruence of norms and incentives. In their unique role, bridging researchers can support the transfer of knowledge as well as initiate new collaborations. On the other hand, with the number of researchers with multiple affiliations rising over the past 25 years from 6.7 to 11.8 percent worldwide [9], the role of authors with multiple affiliations in quantitative assessments is not to be underestimated. The overall performance of organizations in terms of research productivity and citation impact may be increasingly driven by co-affiliated researchers whose output is included in organizational performance metrics, while, in practice, such researchers may contribute little to the organization\u2019s research. This warrants future research that goes more in-depth into the salient phenomenon of multiple affiliations in contemporary research systems.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253462.s001\nWe thank the CWTS team in charge of harmonizing the institutional affiliations in scientific publications and two anonymous reviewers for useful comments.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback."

The data, Eisinger, Ernsthausen, and Kiel explained, which consisted of \u201cthe tax returns of thousands of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years\u201d was handed over to ProPublica \u201cin raw form, with no conditions or conclusions.\u201d The information provides \u201can unprecedented look inside the financial lives of America\u2019s titans, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. It shows not just their income and taxes, but also their investments, stock trades, gambling winnings and even the results of audits.\u201d Presumably it does (or could do) the same with respect to all the \u201cthousands\u201d who had their data pilfered.\nProPublica\u2019s reporters then \u201cspent months processing and analyzing the material to transform it into a usable database.\u201d\nWe then verified the information by comparing elements of it with dozens of already public tax details (in court documents, politicians\u2019 financial disclosures and news stories) as well as by vetting it with individuals whose tax information is contained in the trove. Every person whose tax information is described in this story was asked to comment. Those who responded, including\u00a0Buffett,\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0and\u00a0Icahn, all said they had paid the taxes they owed. . . . Musk responded to an initial query with a lone punctuation mark: \u201c?\u201d After we sent detailed questions to him, he did not reply.\nMusk wins again, I reckon.\nOne of the billionaires mentioned in this article objected arguing that publishing personal tax information is a violation of privacy [but] we have concluded\u00a0that the public interest in knowing this information at this pivotal moment outweighs that legitimate concern.\nAh yes, ends and means.\nMany will ask about the ethics of publishing such private data. We are doing so \u2014 quite selectively and carefully \u2014 because we believe it serves the public interest in fundamental ways, allowing readers to see patterns that were until now hidden.\n\u201cPatterns\u201d (the different treatment of capital and income) that were not \u201chidden\u201d to anyone with a basic awareness of the way in which the tax system works, patterns that are the result of decisions taken by democratically elected legislators, and which generally reflect basic tax principles that have applied for a long time and, with exceptions here and there, across much of the world (once in power, communists preferred outright confiscation).\nEisinger, Ernsthausen, and Kiel may object to those principles and, despite a disclaimer that what \u201cit would take for a fundamental overhaul of the U.S. tax system is not clear,\u201d would probably prefer to see the introduction of some form of wealth tax (a form of taxation that, as the authors concede, has been tried and, by some, abandoned elsewhere, even if they understate the extent of that abandonment), which would, almost by definition, capture unrealized capital gains within its net.\nThe authors have the honesty to mention that where such wealth taxes exist, they are on \u201ca small scale\u201d (I should add, that so far as I am concerned, any wealth tax should, both for practical reasons and as a matter of principle, be rejected). Perhaps it\u2019s worth noting that the now-scrapped Swedish wealth tax on, say, a Jeff Bezos (one of ProPublica\u2019s targets) would have peaked out at about 3 percent in the late 1980s, assuming that he was unable of take advantage of various available reductions. I suspect that quite a few of those in the U.S. who want to see the taxation of unrealized capital gains, a grotesque idea on many levels, might not be satisfied with 3 percent, at least when it comes to the super-rich.\nThere is also a legal question here, and we want you to know we have taken it seriously. A federal law ostensibly makes it a criminal offense to disclose tax return information. But we do not believe that law would be constitutional if applied to bar or sanction publication of a story in the public interest when the news organization did not itself remove the information from the control of the IRS or solicit anyone else to do so \u2014 as we did not.\nI suspect they are right about that. What\u2019s more, I would not describe that as a \u201cloophole,\u201d even if that is a word that the authors of the ProPublica report use several times (for example, \u201cin the coming months, ProPublica will use the IRS data we have obtained to explore in detail how the ultrawealthy avoid taxes, exploit loopholes . . .\u201d) in their own work. The law is the law.\nThe law is unlikely to look so favorably on those who leaked the information.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers that investigating the source of a massive leak of taxpayer information behind an article by ProPublica will be one of his top priorities.\nGood. Let\u2019s see how that goes.\nThe information was stolen illegally, yet on Twitter so many intellectuals were crowing about the disclosure.\u00a0 (Did some of those same people condemn the theft from Biden Jr.\u2019s laptop?\u00a0 How many of them, in other contexts, will defend strong rights of privacy?\u00a0 I guess that right is for everyone except rich people who create a lot of jobs and output.)\nProPublica acted unethically, and in fact nothing fundamentally new or interesting or surprising was learned from their act as accessory.\nThe real story is how the numbers were obtained, and here I fear the worst.\u00a0 A single rogue agent can\u2019t just pull up the files of rich people on demand, as I understand the system (if so, Trump\u2019s return would have leaked a long time ago).\u00a0 So this was probably a coordinated effort of some sort, is it crazy to suspect the Russians having some role in it?\u00a0 Who else has the will and ability?\u00a0 (China has the ability, but the \u201ccoddled rich people\u201d meme is not one they are looking to push.)\u00a0 What other breach of national security has occurred in the process of unearthing this information?\u00a0 How was it done?\u00a0 Are conspiracy theories becoming more true these days?\nIt is stunning to me how little consideration these issues are being given and how poorly so much of our MSM has performed.\nStunning? Not really. Meanwhile, you can read some of the New York Times coverage here.\nThe unanswered question about ProPublica\u2019s leak is where it came from. The news site does not know its origin but has corroborated the data against other sources. A reasonable suspicion is that it was hacked by an entity that does not wish US democracy well. No single IRS officer would have access to all this information.\nProPublica also observes (correctly) that \u201coutside of the U.S., Sweden, Norway and Finland make public every citizen\u2019s tax returns.\u201d This owes a great deal both to the very Nordic concept of, to use the Swedish term, Jantelagen, an anti-individualistic approach to life difficult to reconcile with core American values, reflected also in the \u201cright to roam\u201d across private land contained within the Swedish Allemansr\u00e4tten.\nAmerica is not Sweden. What those who leaked the tax information and those who published it have done, however ironically, risks undermining the administration\u2019s current proposal that the IRS be given even more power to peer into individuals\u2019 private information. If the IRS cannot be trusted to safeguard the secrets with which it is already entrusted, why give it more?\nThe IRS records show that the wealthiest can \u2014 perfectly legally \u2014 pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, their fortunes grow each year.\nWell yes, that\u2019s because those \u201cgains\u201d are largely meaningless until they are realized. Ask those who were worth (on paper) millions during the dot-com boom, and then next to nothing thereafter. In the event a tax on unrealized gains had been in force and levied at that time would they have been given refunds on the unrealized gains \u201caccumulated\u201d during the bubble, but wiped out the year after?\nAnd there\u2019s something else. We are frequently told by those on the left and their fellow travelers that short-term investment horizons are a discreditable feature of \u201ccasino capitalism.\u201d Yet the prospect of being taxed on unrealized gains penalizes those investors and business-builders who are in for the long haul, qualities, we are told, that ought to be encouraged.\nAmerica\u2019s billionaires avail themselves of tax-avoidance strategies beyond the reach of ordinary people. Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell.\nTo capture the financial reality of the richest Americans, ProPublica undertook an analysis that has never been done before. We compared how much in taxes the 25 richest Americans paid each year to how much\u00a0Forbes\u00a0estimated their wealth grew in that same time period.\nWe\u2019re going to call this their true tax rate.\nThey can call it \u201ctrue.\u201d But that does not make it so. Make the case for a wealth tax, however misguided, by all means, but do not pretend that (possibly temporary) growth in unrealized asset values is, in any real sense, \u201cincome.\u201d To be sure, it is true that billionaires can, as the authors highlight, borrow against the value of their assets, but then, so, on a vastly smaller scale, can anyone who takes out a home equity loan. The argument that a loan (whether big or small) which, like all loans, must be repaid is, in some respects, a form of income and thus can be used as the justification for imposing a tax on the asset on which it is secured does not rest on the soundest of logical foundations.\nThere\u2019s much more in the ProPublica piece to consider \u2014 read the whole thing \u2014 but little of it is any more persuasive. I noted, incidentally, a sideswipe at the Trump tax overhaul:\nIn 2018, [Bloomberg] reported income of $1.9 billion. When it came to his taxes, Bloomberg managed to slash his bill by using deductions made possible by tax cuts passed during the Trump administration, charitable donations of $968.3 million and credits for having paid foreign taxes.\nWhat those Trump-derived deductions might have been I don\u2019t know, but charitable donations have long been regarded as a legitimate tax deduction (and not without reason) and so have foreign tax credits, which are essentially a way of avoiding double taxation on the same income.\nNR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.\nGet Jim Geraghty\u2019s tour of the political news of the day.\nGet Kevin D. Williamson\u2019s newsletter delivered to your inbox each Tuesday.\nA weekly digest on business and economics from an NR sensibility.\nMike Bloomberg pays the maximum tax rate on all federal, state, local and international taxable income as prescribed by law.\nTaken together, what Mike gives to charity and pays in taxes amounts to approximately 75% of his annual income (over 95% of which is ordinary income). In other words, he currently only keeps about 25 cents of every dollar he makes. His effective tax rate on any income not given to charity is approximately 45%. If he stopped donating to charity, he would keep about 55 cents of every dollar he makes.\nMike has given $11 billion in his lifetime to charity, for which the U.S. allows a deduction to encourage giving. The tax benefit that he gets from the charitable deduction is a fraction of what he gives to charity and he views any of this tax benefit as more money to put towards charitable causes.\nHe scrupulously obeys the letter and spirit of the law. Mike also pays taxes in more than 30 countries, 35 states and a myriad of cities where his company does business, including New York which has among the highest income tax rates in the country. And as the majority owner of a global business, he pays significant overseas taxes which are not double taxed by the U.S. under federal tax law and international tax agreements.\nThe company repatriates all profits back to America every year . . .\nThe appreciation in the value of Bloomberg\u2019s unrealized assets (relying, doubtless, on their highly debatable methodology, Eisinger, Ernsthausen, and Kiel calculate that \u201cbetween 2014 and 2018, Bloomberg had a true tax rate of 1.30%\u201d) does not rate a mention in his spokesman\u2019s statement. And nor, whether as a matter of law, or even hypothetically, should it have done.\nThen there is the claim that \u201cBloomberg managed to slash his bill [in part] by using deductions made possible by tax cuts passed during the Trump administration.\u201d Even if we accept that as true, perhaps it is worth noting, as Demian Brady wrote for Capital Matters back in February that:\nRecent\u00a0data\u00a0published from the Internal Revenue Service find that the share of income taxes paid by the top 1 percent of filers increased under the first year of the TCJA, while the share of taxes paid by the bottom 50 percent of filers decreased.\nThese findings come straight from an IRS report that breaks down the tax share of income earners for tax-year 2018 \u2014 the first year of taxes filed under the new provisions. Among its changes, the TCJA lowered tax rates, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and expanded the child tax credit.\nThe IRS data show that the top 1 percent of filers, those with adjusted gross income of $540,009 or higher, paid 40.1 percent of all income taxes. This amount is nearly twice as much as their income share.\nDespite the rate reductions under the TCJA, the tax share of the top 1 percent increased compared to 2017. In fact, the National Taxpayers Union Foundation has compiled historical IRS data tracking the distribution of the federal income tax burden back to 1980, and 2018 was the highest share recorded over that period . . .\nThe notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax. But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed. This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes. The \u201cstep-up in basis\u201d is widely recognized by experts across the political spectrum as a flaw in the code.\n\u201cWidely recognized by experts across the political spectrum as a flaw in the code.\u201d\nSome on the left may object to this step-up, but to say that this provision, which is by no means confined to the U.S., is recognized by experts across the political spectrum as a flaw is nonsense.\nThe president\u00a0vows to eliminate\u00a0the so-called \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d rule for inherited property. The president refers to this as a \u201cloophole\u201d that allows the rich to game the system. It is no loophole. In fact, it is a specific rule of law under Internal Revenue Code \u00a71014. This law was not a part of the TCJA. It has been on the books since 1954 but is only now under attack by Democrats looking for ways to take more of your money.\nSuppose your parents own a home worth $200,000. They purchased the home decades ago for, say, $50,000. . . . If you inherit the home after their death, your basis is equal to the fair market value of the property as of the date of death \u2014 in this example, $200,000. See: Code \u00a71014(a)(1). Now if you sell the property for $200,000, there is no capital-gains tax because there\u2019s no gain (sale price minus basis equals gain).\nThis is what we refer to as \u201cstepped-up basis.\u201d And the rule absolutely does not apply only to \u201crich people.\u201d The operation of Code \u00a71014 is not controlled by one\u2019s annual income, the value of the inherited asset, or the total value of one\u2019s estate. It applies across the board. Every American taxpayer enjoys the benefit of stepped-up basis on inherited property.\nIf Code \u00a71014 were repealed in its entirety, all inherited property would be taxed on sale at the capital-gains rate. In general, the gain would be calculated on the difference between the sale price and the price at which the deceased person paid for it (plus any capital improvements that add to the cost basis). To go back to your parents\u2019 home, if they paid $50,000 for it, and you sold it for $200,000 after their death, that $150,000 would be subject to tax. And that example might not be as extreme as it seems. It\u2019s not unlikely that your parents would have held on to their last home for many years.\nOne consolation, however, is that the White House appears to be contemplating exempting the first $1 million in unrealized gains from these new rules, a limit which, if left unchanged, will likely be eroded by inflation over the years, if not outright reduced or eliminated. Moreover, you can expect the tax bill to be calculated at a much higher rate than those currently in effect . . .\nBuffett put it in 2011: \u201cThere\u2019s been class warfare going on for the last 20 years, and my class has won.\u201d\nThat\u2019s imagery designed to conjure up images of greedy plutocrats and hardworking blue-collar folk. In reality, however, this article is just another salvo in the attempt by one section of the elite to wrestle power (and what flows from it) from another. That the result would result in severe damage to the economy and to the aspirations of millions is, it seems, beside the point.\nWe released the latest of a series of podcasts, the Capital Record.

Lacy delivers some hard truths about where we are, how we got here.\nAnd the Capital Matters week that was . . .\nIn May, Bob Chitester, producer of Milton Friedman\u2019s famous\u00a0Free to Choose\u00a0PBS TV series and\u00a0Free to Choose Media, died at the age of 83. Last year marked 40 years since the original airing of the series, which was first released in January 1980, toward the end of the Carter administration, in response to liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith\u2019s\u00a0The Age of Uncertainty\u00a0BBC series released in 1977.\u00a0Free to Choose, in its original run on PBS, played an important part in making Friedman a household-name economist, and it has since attracted millions of views online.\nThe series, which defended the virtues and welfare-enhancing abilities of free-market capitalism that helped set the stage for Reaganism, was launched during an era of rising inflation and big government. Indeed, the supply-shock era of the 1970s was a setting that all too eerily bears resemblance to today\u2019s COVID-19 economic environment amid President Biden\u2019s spending binge, the current \u201ctransitory\u201d uptick in prices, and gas lines following\u00a0the Colonial pipeline cyberattack. (The latter, in fairness, pales when compared with the OPEC embargoes of the 1970s and is hardly the fault of the president.) For this reason alone, everyone should consider watching (or rewatching)\u00a0Free to Choose . . .\nWith\u00a0gas prices\u00a0soaring\u00a0across the country, politicians should be working to fortify American energy independence and ensure that oil companies are treated fairly compared with other industries. Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar must have missed the memo. They\u2019ve introduced a\u00a0bill to make drilling for oil more expensive.\nThe \u201cEnd Polluter Welfare Act,\u201d as they\u2019ve dubbed it, would eliminate a critical tax provision that eases expenses for American oil and gas companies drilling domestically. This bill would eliminate American jobs, reduce wages, and make America more dependent on energy sources in the war-torn Middle East, in addition to raising gas prices . . .\n\u201cIn this house, we believe,\u201d among other things, \u201cscience is real,\u201d reads the sign in front of your most insufferable neighbor\u2019s house. The idea is to signal sophistication and allegiance to the Party of Science. Your most insufferable neighbor wants everyone driving past his house to know that he isn\u2019t one of those slack-jawed Neanderthals he reads about in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0from far-out places like central Pennsylvania or South Jersey. No, he\u2019s pro-science, and he voted for Biden and wrote a stemwinder of a Facebook post back in March praising the president when he\u00a0announced, \u201cScience is back.\u201d\nYour most insufferable neighbor was also happy when Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline project back in January. At long last, TC Energy, the Calgary-based energy company constructing Keystone XL, threw in the towel yesterday and\u00a0announced\u00a0it was abandoning the project. Rather than wait out another American presidential administration and hope the next one would allow it, TC Energy is cutting its losses and moving on . . .\u00a0it seems segments of the Left have fooled themselves into thinking politicians make decisions based on science. They pretty much never do, and for good reason.\nTake the question of Keystone XL. Scientists say that climate change poses a threat to the planet. Scientists have done countless studies demonstrating that in various ways, whether they look at sea levels, temperatures, greenhouse gases, etc. Scientists have found that the Alberta tar-sands oil that Keystone XL would have transported is\u00a0especially bad\u00a0for the environment.\nScientists also work for energy companies. ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, et al. are some of the largest employers of scientists in the world (and they pay them\u00a0fantastically). To find oil reserves (which is a lot harder than you might think), they need earth scientists. Pipeline engineering, too, is a highly technical scientific field. Scientists developed technology to detect minor pipeline leaks\u00a0from outer space, which is actually much faster than detecting them from Earth. The technology uses satellites that analyze the vegetation near pipelines and detect changes in vegetation growth that would indicate hydrocarbon leakage.\nIf your political position is \u201cpro-science,\u201d what do you do? There are brilliant scientists doing outstanding work on climate issues, and there are brilliant scientists doing outstanding work for petroleum and pipeline companies. That\u2019s why Biden\u2019s executive order didn\u2019t use \u201cpro-science\u201d reasoning and instead made it about diplomacy. Science is of very limited use in making this decision because it doesn\u2019t care about politics. Water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees no matter who\u2019s president . . .\nIt is hard to deny that certain forms of environmentalism, often (but certainly not exclusively) when climate change is involved, take on strong religious characteristics, frequently of a distinctly millenarian nature.\n\u201cAs the oat milk brand Oatly spread across the world last year, its chief executive, Toni Petersson,\u00a0said\u00a0his product \u2014 which boasts lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional dairy \u2014 was not just another drink.\n\u201cFor people today, sustainability is more of an ideology. It\u2019s a structured belief system, almost like a religion\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but it\u2019s relied on what the science says,\u201d Petersson said. \u201cAnd I think we as a company have a licence to take a place in that ideology.\u201d\nThe\u00a0science . . .\n\u201cIn 2007, Jeff Bezos, then a multibillionaire and now the world\u2019s richest man, did not pay a penny in federal income taxes. He achieved the feat again in 2011. In 2018, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the second-richest person in the world, also paid no federal income taxes.\nMichael Bloomberg managed to do the same in recent years. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn did it twice. George Soros paid no federal income tax three years in a row.\nProPublica has obtained a vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years.\u00a0The data provides an unprecedented look inside the financial lives of America\u2019s titans, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. It shows not just their income and taxes, but also their investments, stock trades, gambling winnings and even the results of audits.\u201d\nWhat?!?!?\u00a0That\u2019s bad. Tax data are supposed to be private \u2014 and zealously guarded \u2014 and yet \u201cthousands\u201d of people\u2019s information got out . . .\nIt started with the Biden administration arguing that other countries should join the U.S. in adopting a global minimum tax. This is how the White House\u00a0pitched the proposal:\nA minimum tax on U.S. corporations alone is insufficient. . . . President Biden is also proposing to encourage other countries to adopt strong minimum taxes on corporations, just like the United States, so that foreign corporations aren\u2019t advantaged and foreign countries can\u2019t try to get a competitive edge by serving as tax havens.\nThis is a perfect definition of a tax cartel with the explicit intent of suppressing tax competition from countries with lower (and I would argue better) tax systems. And the G-7 nations have now reached an agreement on a 15 percent global minimum tax. But to these government officials, the real value of this agreement is that it will make it easier to bully, or at the very least, to\u00a0exert strong political influence\u00a0over some 135 countries to get them to join their seven-country tax cartel.\nAs America shows its resilience and recovers from\u00a0a devastating pandemic, many American families and entrepreneurs need credit to rebuild their lives and livelihoods. One would think the last thing the nation\u2019s lawmakers would want to do is impose legal uncertainty to hamper the flow of credit to those who need it most.\nYet this is just what Congress seems poised to do. The Senate voted last month to overturn the \u201ctrue lender\u201d rule, which clarified that smaller banks could partner with outside firms to offer credit using the same legal framework under which big banks have long issued credit cards. To ensure that credit flows to deserving American families and small businesses, the House must reject similar attempts to kill the rule through a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution and must leave the Trump administration rule in place . . .\nThe\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports\u00a0that bank are telling their corporate customers to stop making deposits. Yes, you\u2019re reading that correctly: Banks don\u2019t want more deposits.\nThe basic idea of banking is to take in money from deposits and lend it out at interest to borrowers. But with interest rates near zero, banks hardly make any money doing that, so taking in more money from deposits doesn\u2019t do much for them . . .\nA founding father of the Internet, Vint Cerf, attributes its astonishing economic success in no small part to \u201cpermissionless innovation,\u201d the freedom of Internet developers to try new business models and offer new services without obtaining prior government approval. The clear signal government sends by not\u00a0overregulating the market is a reason the Internet today is a staple in our lives. Any calls for Internet regulation should be met with a healthy dose of skepticism, and before acting, the government should ensure that proposed Internet regulation is going to provide more consumer benefit than harm.\nIn a\u00a0recent essay, Facebook vice president for global affairs and former U.K. deputy prime minister Nick Clegg claims that U.S. Internet \u201cregulation is overdue\u201d and proposes bipartisan congressional action in four areas. Two of his broad proposals deal with clarifying rules for the removal of illegal content by Internet platforms and enacting federal privacy legislation. These proposals may have some merit but need to be fleshed out.\nHis other two legislative proposals, however, should be rejected. First, his endorsement of a new federal \u201cdigital regulator\u201d with broad powers would stifle innovation and allow established companies to keep potential rivals out of the market. Second, his call for Congress to regulate speech designed to \u201cmislead people and undermine public trust\u201d and speech involving the use of social media in elections is particularly pernicious. Having the government police speech on the Internet is a recipe for widespread suppression of competing viewpoints and violates the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of freedom of speech . . .\nSometimes it seems like everywhere you turn, a company is taking another political stance or harping on a new buzzword. Hollywood, Big Tech corporations, and even car companies feature slogans that feel\u00a0brazenly partisan. Many on the right have reacted to this new phenomenon by asserting that Americans don\u2019t want an openly political marketplace. However, as more people find purpose and belonging in their work, conservatives should feel encouraged that \u201cdo-gooding\u201d can be a profitable and desirable business model . . .\nThe disruption of production has contributed to higher housing prices (lumber prices hit an all-time high last month, with mills unable to keep up with demand) and an enormous run-up in the prices of some goods, notably vehicles and luxury items, as well as shortages in other goods (such as firearms ammunition) that can be difficult to lay hands on at any price. When that gets sorted out, it should \u2014\u00a0should\u00a0\u2014 take the pressure off some prices, including in such important sectors as houses and cars.\nBut that may not be enough to lower the current momentum toward higher prices. As economists sometimes put it, the question before policy-makers is whether the inflation we are seeing is\u00a0sticky, meaning that higher prices are likely to stay with us for a long time rather than being a short-lived blip. Sticky inflation is a problem because it can stick around even when economic growth slows or stagnates, a condition that persisted in the 1970s and gave us the term \u201cstagflation.\u201d Nobody much enjoyed stagflation.\nSome people did enjoy the countermeasures that were deployed against stagflation \u2014 sky-high interest rates. There are still among us people of a certain age who fondly remember getting\u00a014 percent on their Treasuries back in the 1980s. It was a good deal if you were rich and neither working nor looking for a mortgage.\nAnd that\u2019s the long-term reason to worry about inflation. When the Fed drives up interest rates to slow down inflation, it generally raises borrowing costs throughout the credit markets \u2014 including, ultimately, the cost of financing our national debt. Debt service will cost the U.S. government about $380 billion this year, accounting for 8 percent of all federal spending. For perspective, that is about what is spent on undergraduate instruction at all of the nation\u2019s public colleges and universities combined. It\u2019s a big chunk of change \u2014 and it\u2019s big with interest rates that are very, very low by historical standards. If the cost of financing the debt goes up, it could easily blow a Pentagon-sized hole in the federal budget. Money that gets spent on debt service is money that isn\u2019t available for other things, whether that\u2019s the ordinary heavy expenditure for Social Security and Medicare or emergency measures in the face of some unknown future crisis. The more you owe, the fewer options you have . . .\nWe also held a webinar on inflation featuring Kevin Hassett. You can see it here.\nFor the last decade or so, as the nation\u2019s debt grew and the Federal Reserve kept pumping money into the financial system, there were periodic warnings about the risk of inflation. Yet these fears were never actually realized. As a result, in the face of growing signs of inflation, many people \u2014 including the ones who happen to run our nation\u2019s fiscal and monetary policy \u2014 aren\u2019t taking the current threat all that seriously. This is worrisome, because in reality, a growing body of evidence \u2014 major economic indicators and announcements from small and large businesses \u2014 suggests that\u00a0inflation\u00a0is quite real.\nConsumer prices leapt 5 percent in May year-over-year after gaining 4.2 percent in April, with some sectors experiencing gains not seen in decades. The growth of the\u00a0money supply\u00a0has been\u00a0off the charts. A survey by NFIB, the largest advocacy group for small businesses, found that 48 percent of businesses reported raising prices, compared with just 5 percent who reported lowering prices \u2014 the widest gap\u00a0since 1981. In addition, Factset found that in the first quarter,\u00a0more S&P 500 companies brought up inflation in their earnings calls\u00a0than any other quarter since the data firm began keeping track in 2010 . . .\nAs no country is immune to COVID-19\u2019s disruptions in the food-supply chain,\u201d I wrote in Capital Matters on June 2, 2020, \u201cfood inflation is now again on the prowl.\u201d Now, a year later, its prowl has turned into a pounce. According to data released by the United Nations on June 3, 2021, global food inflation has jumped to a height unseen in roughly a decade. Last year, food inflation was a worry for many government officials. Now, it\u2019s materialized into a real foe that many are grappling with. And this foe, these latest numbers indicate, has grown to the point that it poses a real threat to the stability of governments . . .\nRobert H. Bork Jr:\nRachel Bovard has\u00a0a well-written piece\u00a0in\u00a0The American Conservative\u00a0that argues for those of us on the right to rediscover our true tradition of using antitrust law to stand up to powerful concentrations of market power. By the time you finish reading her piece, it will seem as if aggressive antitrust action is as Republican as splitting rails and running an underground railroad.\nBut conservatives should reject her approach. Throughout her piece, Bovard focuses solely on a handful of Big Tech companies for their content decisions that anger conservatives. On this narrow concern, she endorses a purported return to a conservative stand against bigness that would, if enacted, mean the end of capitalism as we know it in America.\nIf that sounds a bit hyperbolic, consider the two leading antitrust bills in the Senate today . . .\nBezos\u2019s trip to space would, if successful, prove to be a remarkable demonstration of the vitality of free enterprise and the successes achievable through the privatization of space exploration. NASA\u2019s decision to outsource space-exploration projects has contributed to the expansion of the private space industry. The possibility of lucrative government contracts has incentivized corporations to invest resources and efforts, with considerable success, in the development of space technology to remain competitive. Such development is also prompted by the desire to spearhead the new and potentially enormously profitable industry of space travel.\nAmong the leading space companies, Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin is not the only one taking long strides forward. Elon Musk\u2019s Space X had announced plans to launch the first all-civilian mission to space in February. Virgin Galactic\u2019s founder Richard Branson is allegedly attempting to reach space before Bezos does by securing himself a seat on a test flight scheduled to take off over the Fourth of July weekend. Another space race appears to be on the horizon \u2014 only this time, it is among corporations instead of nations. Consider this another reason to endorse the privatization of space exploration \u2014 a space race among nations could put polities at odds; a space race among corporations encourages innovation and progress . . .\nFinally, we produced the Capital Note, our \u201cdaily\u201d (well, Tuesday\u2013Friday, anyway).

One of the major ongoing concerns related to BGP is its lack of effective security measures, and as a result the routing infrastructure of the Internet continues to be vulnerable to various forms of attack.\nThe Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GSTM) was originally described in [2] and updated in [3] and is based on the observation that the overall majority of BGP peering sessions are established between routers that are directly connected. The technique is to configure each BGP IP packet to be sent with a TTL field value in the IP header of 255, and for the BGP receiver to discard all packets with an inbound TTL of less than a set threshold value. For a direct connection the inbound TTL value should be 255, so all inbound TCP packets with within this session with a TTL of 254 or less can be discarded by the receiver.\nThe motivation for this approach is that spoofing of the TTL field in an IP header is challenging for an unassisted remote attacker. This TTL packet filter is a lightweight defensive measure intended to add some protection to the BGP session from efforts to intrude into the session using remote attacks. This GTSM approach can be used for multi-hop BGP peer sessions as well as directly connected BGP sessions, but it is not all that robust in terms of its security properties because of the additional variables introduced with TTL changes due to routing changes and the potential to mask the conventional TTL behaviour with tunnelling techniques.\nA more robust approach to protecting the TCP session is through the use of cryptographic protection of the TCP session. While these crypto approaches can be highly resilient to intrusion attempts, they also expose the BGP speaker to potential denial of service attacks if the processing load of the cryptographic functions to detect bogus packets is sufficiently high. Bogus packets still have to be processed by the target just to ascertain that they are bogus.\nThe TCP MD5 Signature Option [4] uses message authentication codes, which are a class of cryptographic hash algorithms applied to messages of arbitrary length that produce a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmessage digest\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the message, intended to protect the integrity of a message. The desired property of a message digest is that it is infeasible to generate two messages that have the same message digest value, and equally infeasible to generate a new message that has a particular message digest value. The MD5 algorithm [5] is intended for digital signature applications where a message digest is generated over the combination of a message and a secret shared key value. The message and the digest value can be transmitted openly, and the receiver can use a local copy of the secret key and apply the message digest algorithm to the combination of the received message and the key. If the digest value matches the received value, then the receiver can be assured that the message has not been altered in transit, and that the message was generated by a party who also has knowledge of the key.\nThe TCP MD5 Signature option is a TCP extension where each TCP segment contains a TCP option that contains the 128-bit MD5 digest of the combination of the TCP pseudo header, the TCP segment payload excluding TCP options, and a connection-specific key. This establishes a cryptographically secure signature of the packet. Without knowing the key, it is very challenging to construct a TCP segment with a valid signature, nor is it readily possible to alter the packet without causing the signature to be invalidated. The receiver calculates the MD5 digest across the received data, using a locally held copy of the key, and rejects the segment if the digest value fails to match that provided in the packet. In the context of BGP the TCP session is resistant to various forms of intrusion attack unless the attacker has knowledge of the shared secret key value. The TCP MD5 specification does not specify how the shared key is passed between the two BGP speakers, nor how the key value can be changed during the session. This latter problem is significant, in that continued use of a key weakens its integrity, and it is conventionally advised that MD5 session keys should be changed every 90 days or so in this type of use context [6]. With a mechanism for in-band key change, this advice implies the need for a BGP session reset every 90 days or so, which is counter to conventional operational practice in BGP where sessions are held up for as long as possible. Even with tools such as BGP graceful restart, deliberate BGP session resets are generally avoided in the operational community.\nA somewhat different approach, the TCP Authentication Option [7], uses a Message Authentication Field in the place of the MD5 message digest, where the final bit of the length field of the option determines whether a key ID has been appended to the Message Authentication Code or not. The message digest algorithm in this case is specified as HMAC-MD5- 96, although other algorithms can be used if configured in advance. This approach relies on a similar form of out-of-band provisioning as the original MD5 approach, where each end of the conversation must configure a TCP Security Association Database in advance of the use of this mechanism. This database contains a description of the supported TCP connections, the key set, the MAC algorithm, and MAC length.\nIPSEC is a suite of protocols that operate at the IP level of the protocol stack that secures all communications between two endpoints [8]. The functionality of IPSEC includes methods for protection of IP packet headers, methods for protection and encryption of IP payloads and key management services that allow key rollover during long held sessions. This is an implementation of public/private key cryptography and can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of all IP messages passed between two hosts. IPSEC can be used to secure BGP sessions, and it provides greater levels of assurance than can be derived from MD5.\nHowever, IPSEC is not widely used in the public Internet for the purpose of securing BGP sessions [79], and no generally accepted profile of IPSEC for BGP has been standardised so far, with earlier efforts along these lines not progressing within the standards process. The perceived problem with IPSEC relate to the complications for rekeying IKE/IPSEC sessions, and the observation that processing load to detect bogus packets is considerably higher with IPSEC than MD5. This exposes a denial-of-service attack where a stream of bogus IPSEC packets directed at a BGP speaker may be capable of exercising the processor into a fully saturated mode of operation, causing other concurrent router functions to be degraded.\nAs was observed in Part 1 of this servey, there are many alternatives here, including TLS [80] and QUIC [81], but more choice is not a substitute for better quality. These session-level encryption approaches used by applications provide no better answer to dynamic rekeying and follow a now well-established Internet tradition of adding more options to divert attention from the observation that the common fundamental problems are inadequately addressed many or either all such options! The design goal of such application-level session approaches is protection for transient short-duration sessions, while the vulnerabilities associated with long-held BGP sessions are somewhat different.\nWhile the link-state approach described in this paper does not exactly match the interdomain routing environment, the concept of validation of routing information is a consistent theme in all BGP security architectures.\nSubsequent work by Smith and Garcia-Luna-Aceves [10], [11], published in 1996, attempts to address session security by modifying the BGP protocol. This work proposed the protection of BGP control messages using message encryption at the BGP level, with session keys exchanged at BGP session establishment time. It also proposed the addition of a message sequence number to protect against replay attacks and message removal. This approach also proposed a predecessor path attribute that indicated the AS prior to the destination AS for the current route and proposed digitally signing all fixed fields in the UPDATE message. The predecessor attribute is used to construct a means of validation of the AS Path attribute. These proposed changes to the BGP protocol required comprehensive adoption and deployment in order to be effective, as partial adoption would create gaps in any assurance that a predecessor attribute could provide. Their approach was similar to the earlier IDRP work [12]. IDRP eschewed the use of TCP and included a reliable flow-controlled transport into the IDRP protocol, also including a number of message integrity protection options.\nA contemporary proposal to the Smith and Garcia-Lunes-Aceves proposal for securing BGP was based on leaving the BGP protocol unchanged but augmenting the BGP data flow with access to credential information. This additional information was intended to allow a BGP speaker to confirm the authenticity of origination information in BGP UPDATE messages by validating the binding of address prefixes to originating ASes [13]. This proposal, NLRI origin AS verification, used the DNS as the distribution mechanism for origination information, where a BGP speaker could perform a DNS query to validate the prefix size and authorised originating AS information contained in a BGP route object. Informally, it was intended to allow a DNS query to answer the question: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich ASes have been authorised by the address holder to originate a route for this prefix?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The proposed framework assumed that the reverse DNS space was securely associated with the holder of the address prefix, and the DNS response was verifiable (using a DNSSEC-signed DNS record and DNSSEC validation [14], presumably, although this work was contemporaneous with DNSSEC and did not make use of it in this proposal). This proposal assumed that the performance of DNS queries was within the same order of timescale as the propagation of BGP messages within BGP. It also assumed that there was no circularity, where a DNS recursive resolver or authoritative name server used by the BGP speaker was located within an address prefix that was being validated prior to local acceptance of the route associated that that prefix.\nThe DNS delegation hierarchy would need to be precisely aligned to the address allocation framework, so that the zone administrator of each of these origination authentication zones was in fact the duly delegated holder of the addresses, and this alignment should, preferably, be capable of being validated by third parties. Meeting these requirements would create a digital signature hierarchy embedded in the DNS that would be aligned to the address allocation framework.\nThe Internet Routing Registry (IRR) [82] pre-dates most other efforts in this space, and dates back to the routing work of the early 1990\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the Routing Arbiter project that was part of the US NSFNET, and a project coordinated under the auspices of RIPE in Europe. The IRR objective was to provide a set of routing policy databases populated by the ASes themselves that described the addresses that they intended to announce in the routing system and the routing policies that they intended to apply to these announcements [83]. The Routing Registry was to a response to the need described in RFC 1787 [84] for improving global consistency by allowing providers share routing policies. Each participating AS submits policy data, encoded using the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [27] [28]. Clients may use the registry to determine the stated policies for a particular AS, including what ASes (and possibly prefixes) are suitable for import or export, potentially using the data to populate filter sets on their BGP feeds. Additional information provided to the IRR by an AS could include policy concerning the configuration of BGP communities and the policy responses associated with particular community settings.\nHowever, the utility of the IRR for securing routing is quite limited. First, the IRR does not provide information about current routes, but only about potential routes. Some potential routes may be legal according to the IRR, but undesirable from a more global point of view. Next, the IRR has many security vulnerabilities concerning the integrity of registry contents and authorization of changes to the registry. There is no intrinsic authority model that constrains which party can publish data about addresses and ASes in an IRR. Moreover, some policy information concerning agreements between peering ASes is not intended for broader public distribution and the IRRs did not normally implement any form of limited disclosure rules. Efforts to improve the controls over the authority framework in registries and access frameworks [85] never really gained traction. The IRR system is a misnomer, in that there is not a single IRR but many IRRs. The contents of these IRRs are not necessarily mutually consistent and there is no clear way to resolve any such conflicts. Not only is there no authority model ensuring that only authorised parties may publish routing policy data about their own address prefixes and ASes, but there is also no way to describe the intended lifetime of the information. Old information that is no longer current or relevant sits alongside current information, and this sits along with contingency information that may never be actually used. While the overall approach of providing an out-of-band commentary on routing, enumerating all the cases of authorised (or valid) route objects has been a useful tool for many operational environments, IRR tools are only truly useful in the context of being able to detect and filter routing anomalies if the information is verifiable and authentic, current and complete. In other words, IRRs are most useful it that are carefully and continuously managed, and the accuracy and usefulness of the information rapidly declines if the information in the registry is neglected. Our experience with IRRs suggests that it would be somewhat foolhardy to automatically apply IRR data to populate route filters, given the risks of incorrect outcomes, both positive and negative, and while there have been good counter examples in some operational communities, the broader judgement for IRRs being capable of supporting a robust whole-of-internet role for route integrity is somewhat negative [86].\nIt appears that the common requirements in this space appear to relate to authenticity, currency and completeness.\nDigital signatures can provide strong assurance related to authenticity and currency of information, assuming that there is robust enrolment practice than governs the authority to generate such signatures. Given such a practice, the consequent observation is that whether this digital signature framework is placed into the DNS, via a DNSSEC framework [15], or placed into a framework of X.509 certificates and an associated PKI is, at one level, an isomorphic transform of the same information. The issue of the choice of DNS (and DNSSEC) or X.509 certificates (and certificate-based validation) is then an issue of the performance requirements of these systems.\nCompleteness is a more challenging requirement. The identification of invalid routing information in the partial adoption case of this approach is unclear. When a query to an information source has a negative response, it is unclear whether the route object that was the basis of the query is not valid (such as a bogus prefix, or a bogus AS), or whether the database being queried is incomplete.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now move forward in time to review some more recent proposals to secure BGP.\nSecure BGP (sBGP) [16] offered a relatively complete approach to securing the BGP protocol by placing digital signatures over the address and AS Path information contained in routing advertisements and defining an associated PKI for validation of these signatures.\nIn addition, for every prefix and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s originating AS, the prefix must be a validly allocated prefix, and the prefix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-of-use\u00e2\u0080\u009d holder must have authorised the advertisement of the prefix and must have authorised the originating AS to advertise the prefix.\nThe basic security framework proposed in sBGP is that of digital signatures, X.509 certificates and PKIs to enable BGP speakers to verify the identities and authorisation of other BGP speakers, AS administrators and address prefix owners.\nThe verification framework for sBGP requires a PKI for address allocations, where every address assignment is reflected in an issued certificate [17]. This PKI provides a means of verification of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cright-of-use\u00e2\u0080\u009d of an address. A second PKI maps the assignment of ASes, where an AS number assignment is reflected in an issued certificate, and the association between an AS number and a BGP speaking router is reflected in a subordinate certificate. In addition, sBGP proposes the use of IPSEC to secure the inter-router communication paths.\nsBGP also proposes the use of attestations. An address attestation is produced by an address holder and authorises a nominated AS to advertise itself as the origin AS for a particular address prefix. A route attestation is produced by an AS holder and attests that a BGP speaker is an authorised member of that AS and that it has received a specified route. The address and AS PKIs, together with these attestations, allow a BGP speaker to verify the origination of a route advertisement and verify that the AS path as specified in the BGP UPDATE is the path taken by the routing UPDATE message via the sequence of nested route attestations.\nInter-operation and information exchange between sBGP elements is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 - sBGP: Certificates for each ISP are issued by the regional registries. The ISPs exchange public keys through special repositories. The keys are pushed to the sBGP routers which validate the BGP UPDATE messages\nsBGP proposed to distribute the address attestations and the set of certificates that compose the two PKIs via conventional distribution mechanisms outside of BGP messages. For route attestations it is necessary to pass these attestations via path attributes of the BGP UPDATE message, as an additional attribute of the UPDATE message.\nThere are a number of significant issues that were identified with sBGP including the computation burden for signature generation and validation, the increased load in BGP session restart, the issue of piecemeal deployment and the completeness of route attestations, and the requirement that the BGP UPDATE message has to traverse the same AS sequence as that contained in the UPDATE message [18], [19].\nSecure Origin BGP (soBGP) [20] [21] was a response to some of the significant issues that were raised with the sBGP approach, particularly relating to the update processing load when validating the chain of router attestations and the potential overhead of signing every advertised UPDATE with a locally generated router attestation.\nThe validation questions posed by soBGP also included the notion of an explicit authorisation from the address holder to the originating AS to advertise the prefix into the routing system. soBGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AS path validation is quite different from sBGP, in that soBGP attempted to validate that the AS path, as presented in the UPDATE message, represents a feasible inter-AS path from the BGP speaker to the destination AS. This feasibility test is a weaker validation condition than validating that the UPDATE message actually traversed the AS path described in the message.\nsoBGP avoids the use of a hierarchical PKI that mirrors the AS number distribution framework and nominates the use of a web of trust, or a reputation mechanism, as means of validation of these certificates. At the time no Address or AS PKI had been devised or deployed, so this web of trust approach was a pragmatic response to this critical omission. soBGP uses the concept of an AuthCert to bind an address prefix to an originating AS. This AuthCert is not signed by the address holder, but by a private key that is bound to an AS via an EntityCert. soBGP deliberately avoided the use of a PKI which was derived from the established AS and address distribution framework. This appears to have been a pragmatic consideration at the time, as no such PKI existed at the time, and it was unclear if the various address registries were in a position to undertake such a role of administering such a specialised PKI in any case. This left open the issue of how to establish trust anchors for validation of these signed objects, which was a rather significant deficiency in the validation framework of soBGP.\nInstead of sBGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s route attestations, soBGP used the concept of an ASPolicyCert as the foundation for constructing the data for testing the feasibility of a given AS Path. An ASPolicyCert contained a list of the AS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local peer ASes, signed by the AS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private key. An AS peering was considered valid only if both ASes list each other in their respective ASPolicyCerts. Figure 2 depicts a possible soBGP peering network.\nFigure 2 -  The ASPolicyCert is a self signed certificate containing routing policies. An UPDATE message originating at AS4 would necessarily take the Path {AS4,AS5,AS2,AS1} instead of {AS4,AS3,AS2,AS1} becuase the connection between AS2 and AS3 would not be regarded as valid.\nThe overall approach proposed in soBGP represented a different set of design trade-offs to sBGP, where the amount of validated material in a BGP UPDATE message is reduced. This approach was intended to reduce the processing overhead for validation of UPDATE messages. In soBGP each local BGP speaker assembles a validated inter-AS topology map as it collects ASPolicyCerts, and each AS Path in UPDATE messages is then checked to see if the AS sequence matches a feasible inter-AS path in this map. soBGP proposed to use BGP itself to flood ASPolicyCerts through the network, using a new BGP message type (a Security Message) for this function.\nThe use of Web of Trust and the avoidance of a hierarchical PKI for the validation of AuthCerts and EntityCerts could be considered a weakness in this approach, as the derivation of authority to speak about addresses is very unclear in this model, but this absence was a result of the protocol being developed prior to the completion of the work on the RPKI. It is clear that soBGP could be readily adapted to use the RPKI as its trust and authority framework.\nsoBGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of BGP itself to flood the security credentials though the network represented an interesting approach to the problem of distributing such credentials, but it also raised some at the time unanswered questions relating to partial deployment scenarios. Interest in continuing work on soBGP waned in the early 2000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, most likely in recognition that there was an inadequate level of operator demand to sustain the development effort.\nPretty Secure BGP (psBGP) [22] put forward the proposition that the proposals relating to the authentication of the use of an address in a routing context must either rely on the use of signed attestations that need to be validated in the context of a PKI or rely on the authenticity of information contained in Internet Routing Registries.\nThe weakness of routing registries is that the commonly used access controls to the registry are insufficient to validate the accuracy or the current authenticity of the information that is represented as being contained in a route registry object. The information may have been accurate at the time the information was entered into the registry, but this may no longer be the case at the time the information is accessed by a relying party.\nThe psBGP approach was also motivated by the proponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion that a PKI could not be constructed in a deterministic manner because of the indeterminate nature of some forms of address allocations. This led to the assertion that any approach that relied on trusted sources of comprehensive information about prefix assignments and the identity of current right-of-use holders of address space was not a feasible proposition. Accordingly, psBGP rejected the notion of a hierarchical PKI that could be used to validate assertions about addresses and their use.\nInterestingly, although psBGP rejected the notion of a hierarchical address PKI, psBGP assumed the existence of a centralised trust model for AS numbers and the existence of a hierarchical PKI that allowed public keys to be associated with AS numbers in a manner that could be validated in the context of this PKI. This exposed a basic inconsistency in the assumptions that lie behind psBGP, namely that a hierarchical PKI for ASes aligned to the AS distribution framework was assumed to be feasible, but a comparable PKI for addresses was not. Given that the same distribution framework has been used for both resources in the context of the Internet, it is unclear why this distinction between ASes and addresses was necessary or even appropriate.\npsBGP used a rating mechanism similar to that used by PGP [23], but in this case the rating was used for prefix origination. An AS asserted the prefixes it originated and also could list the prefixes originated by its AS peers in signed attestation. The ability of an AS to sign an attestation about prefixes originated by a neighbour AS allowed a psBGP speaker to infer AS neighbour relationship from such assertions, allowing the local BGP speaker to construct a local model of interAS topology in a fashion analogous to soBGP. One of the critical differences between psBGP and soBGP was the explicit inclusion of the strict AS Path validation test, namely that it was a goal of psBGP to allow a BGP speaker to verify that the BGP UPDATE message traversed the same sequence of ASes as is asserted in the AS Path of the UPDATE message. The AS path validation function relies on a sequence of nested digital signatures of each of the ASes in the AS Path for trusted validation, using a similar approach to sBGP. However, psBGP allowed for partial path signatures to exist, mapping the validation outcome to a confidence level rather than a more basic sBGP model of accepting an AS path only if the AS Path in the BGP UPDATE message was completely verifiable.\nThe essential approach of psBGP was the use of a reputation scheme in place of a hierarchical address PKI, but the value of this contribution was based on accepting the underlying premise that a hierarchical PKI for addresses was infeasible. It is also noted that the basis of accepting inter-AS ratings in order to construct a local trust value was based on accepting the validity of an AS trust rating, which, in turn, was predicated upon the integrity of the AS hierarchical PKI. psBGP appeared to be needlessly complex and bears much of the characteristics of making a particular solution fit the problem, rather than attempting to craft a solution within the bounds of the problem space.\nThe use of inter-AS cross certification with prefix assertion lists introduces considerable complexity in both the treatment of confidence in the assertions and in the resulting assessment of the reliability of the verification of the outcome. psBGP does not consider the alternate case where the trust model relating to addresses is based on a hierarchical PKI that mirrors the address distribution framework. In such a case the calculation of confidence levels would be largely unnecessary. The major contribution of psBGP relates to the case of partial deployment of a security solution in relation to AS Path validation, with the calculation of a confidence rating in the face of partial security information.\nThe approaches to securing the semantics of BGP described in this section so far all entail changes to the operation of BGP itself and operate most effectively in an environment of universal deployment. In practical terms this is an unlikely scenario, and the experience with the uptake of modifications to BGP that supported 32-bit AS number values suggests that the public Internet has considerable inertia and is very resistant to adopting changes to BGP [24]. In such a system as large as the public Internet, long term piecemeal deployment is a far more likely scenario.\nThe approach proposed with Inter-domain Route Validation (IRV) [25] is not to modify the BGP protocol in any way, but to define a companion information distribution protocol. The intent here was to attempt to provide legacy compatibility and incremental deployment capability. The IRV approach replaced the concept of simultaneously feeding both routing information and associated credentials in BGP with the concept of moving the provision of credentials into a query response framework where the receiver of a route object can query the originating AS as to the authenticity of a received route object, or request additional information relating to the object in a similar fashion to the information contained in an Internet Routing Registry (IRR) [26]. In IRV each AS is responsible for providing an IRV server capable of providing authoritative responses relating to prefixes originated by this AS. IRV is envisaged as being used to provide routing policy information, using the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [27], [28] structure already used by the Internet Route Registries (IRRs), community configuration information, contact information, a local view of the routing system in terms of received route advertisements and withdrawals and route updates that have been sent to neighbouring ASes.\nAssuming that there is a way to reliably query a per-AS IRV server, and receive a response that can be validated, then AS origination validation in the IRV framework is a case of querying the originating AS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IRV server with the origination query for the prefix in question and verifying the response. In a similar fashion AS Path validation is a case of querying each AS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IRV server in the AS path, confirming that an advertisement was received from the previous AS in the AS Path, and that an advertisement has been sent to the next AS in the AS path (Figure 3). This approach is midway between a strict AS Path test that validates that the UPDATE message was passed along the AS sequence described in the AS Path, and AS Path plausibility that validates that there is a set of AS peer connections that correspond to the AS sequence. Here the validation test is that each AS in the sequence is currently advertising this prefix to the next AS in sequence.\nThis IRV architecture has a number of issues that are not completely specified, including IRV discovery, IRV query redirection, authentication of queries and responses, selective responses, transport layer protection and imposed overheads. It is unclear how an IRV response is to be validated, and how the relying party can verify that the received response originated from the IRV server of the AS in question, that the response has not been altered in any way, and that the response represents the actual held state in the queried AS. A similar concern lies in the estimation of additional overhead associated with performing a query to each AS in the AS Path for every received BGP UPDATE. It is also unspecified whether the query and response is a precondition to the local acceptance of a BGP route or not. While making validation of a route a precondition for acceptance of a route would appear to offer a more robust form of security, it is also the case that the IRV associated with the originating AS may only be reachable via the prefix being advertised, in which case the IRV would be unreachable until the route is accepted. It is also unclear to what extent the additional information that the IRV could provide would be useful within strict real time constraints.\nThe IRV approach is essentially an extension of the IRR concept that further decentralises the publication point of routing information to individual ASes. It extends the IRR in a manner that is intended to provide adequate assurance that received responses are responses to the original query, that the response has been formed by the authoritative IRV for an AS, that the response is complete and has not been altered in any way, and that the response is an accurate representation of the state of the remote AS, using DNS-style chained look-ups. What is unclear here is whether this decentralisation has superior performance and security properties to an alternative approach of further augmentation to the existing IRR framework.\nA similar approach within the IRR framework that integrates the concept of an address and AS PKI could make provision for signed responses in a way that allows the IRR client to authenticate that the response is accurate, current, and contains information that has been digitally signed by the AS or prefix holder. In such a model of publication the relying party is able to validate the authenticity of the IRR object independently of the manner in which the object was published or the manner in which it has been retrieved [29].\nThe first two classes are attacks via BGP, whereas the second two could be more accurately classified as attacks on the routing system itself through multi-party collusion. SPV takes the approach of tree-authenticated hash values and applies this specifically to AS Path validation as an alternative to the nested digital signature structure proposed as the AS Path validation mechanism of sBGP. The paper claims significantly improved processor performance using this technique, based on difference in computational complexity for asymmetric cryptography from symmetric cryptography as used in hash functions.\nThis proposal falls into the category of proposals that calls for changes to the operation of the BGP protocol. In this case the significant change is the requirement that all routes must be re-advertised to peers within a fixed time interval. This is the weakest part of the approach in terms of performance evaluation, as much of the leverage in terms of scaling BGP, is based on the use of a reliable transport protocol for BGP messages which, in turn, obviated any need for a BGP readvertisement function. The need to regularly re-advertise the entire routing table to all peers has some adverse implications in terms of the performance of the protocol and its scaling capabilities.\nSPV also assumes that the originating AS has knowledge of the private key associated with an address, as distinct from the more logical approach that an originating AS need only be able to produce an authority from the address allowing the AS to originate the advertisement. This approach, while efficient on processing speed, requires more storage, a higher level of time synchronisation, higher update rates within the BGP protocol, coupled with some form of loose time synchronisation and complex key pair distribution. It has also been observed [31] that SPV does not sufficiently protect against route forgery and eavesdropping or collusion attacks.\nIf the signature load of sBGP is the problem, then how can this load be reduced? This question has been studied in a number of papers.\nIt may be possible to amortise the cost of signature validation over many messages [32]. The technique signs a subset of the connected topology over which an UPDATE flows and placing a topology description as a vector in an equivalent of an AS connectivity attestation which is flooded to all relying parties. The AS Path signing can then be generalized such that the same vector is reproduced in the signed data, with the AS neighbours who were passed the UPDATE messages marked in the bit vector. All AS neighbours can now receive the same UPDATE.\nRelated work [33] combines the time-efficient approach of signature amortisation with space-efficient techniques of aggregate signatures to propose a set of constructions for aggregated path authentication that improve on sBGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirements for processing throughput and memory space.\nAggregate signatures apply to a collection of UPDATE messages that are to be sent to a peer. Instead of signing each UPDATE separately, the UPDATE messages are hashed into a Merkle hash tree [34] and the root of the tree is signed, and the UPDATE and the root of the hash tree is sent as the signed UPDATE to each peer. This technique improves upon [35] which uses bi-linear maps instead of Merkle hash trees.\nMitigating the validation overhead can also be achieved by caching validation outcomes and reapplying the outcome if the same update information is received within the cache lifetime. A study by Butler, McDaniel, and Aiello [36] noted that across a one-month period less that 2% of advertised prefixes were advertised using more than 10 paths and less than 0.06% of prefixes were advertised with more than 20 paths.\nTheir paper proposed combining a number of approaches to reduce the AS Path validation workload. The first was the use of hash chains and signature aggregation, where a BGP speaker sends all local viable paths to its peers along with the tokens that represent hash chain anchors, allowing route change to be represented by an authentication token that can be validated by hash operations. The second part of the approach was to use Merkle hash trees to sign across a set of UPDATE messages that are queued awaiting the MRAI Timer. The third part of the approach was to exploit the stability of path advertisements to amortise cryptographic operations over many validations, achieved by caching the cryptographic proofs.\nThe paper asserted that simulations point to a reduction of the computational costs by as much as 97% over existing approaches using this approach.\nAnother approach, termed pretty good BGP (pgBGP) [37], analyses path stability over a longer period of time and builds a local database which is then consulted in order to detect anomalous routes. The idea is that origin ASes usually do not suddenly change over time for certain prefixes, and that such a sudden change might indicate an attack to the routing system. pgBGP does not provide completely automated security, as it does not eliminate any route advertisements, but rather puts them into quarantine for 24 hours (similar to route flap damping), giving operators the time to decide how to classify the event. This proposal can be incrementally deployed and imposes little overhead on the routing system. It is a method to mitigate effects of an attack to the routing system, and not an effective mechanism for prevention of such attacks.\nOne special case of routing attacks which is considered a major threat and evokes high interest in the research community is prefix hijacking. There has been a considerable amount of research undertaken in order to provide security against this single form of attack. The approaches describe possible methods of detecting prefix hijacking [38], [39], [40], [41] as well as complete systems and implementations of prefix hijacking detection in order to possibly react on the attack. These systems [42], [43], [44], [45] rely on existing external route monitoring databases like Route Views [46] or need special routing registries to be deployed to detect prefix hijacking. The quality of such prefix hijack detection systems is strongly dependent on the quality of the route databases, all of which have some level of perspective bias given that all views of the BGP routing system are relative to the location of the collector.\nAnother method to detect prefix hijacking is to look for multiple origin AS (MOAS) [47], [48], which can be either a sign of multi-homing an AS or a sign of bogus route announcements, thus prefix hijacking.\nA different approach is presented for iSPY [49], which tries to detect prefix hijacking by continuously probing known transit ASes in order to detect whether the prefix owned by the probing AS has been hijacked through a path change in the routing fabric to reach the address prefix.\nIf securing BGP is a case of applying cryptographic operations to BGP UPDATE messages, then the other approach to reducing the security overhead is to exploit the dynamic behaviour of these messages.\nThe BGP update pattern is studied in [50] where in a study of BGP update dynamics it was shown that a cache of 10,000 prefix and AS Path validation outcomes, or less than 5% of the total number of distinct routed entries, would achieve a cache rate of between 30% to 50% using a simple LRU cache replacement algorithm.\nWhen distance vector algorithms react to a change in prefix reachability a number of UPDATE messages are generally observed before the routing system reaches a stable state. A study of BGP convergence across the global Internet concluded that the severity of path exploration and the convergence speed depends on the relative positions of the event origin and the observer [51]. This study aligned the originator and the observer in terms of the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctiering\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Internet Service Providers and noted that this extended convergence times and larger path exploration events occurred at lower levels of the tiering hierarchy. It was hypothesised that the richer inter-connectivity that was typically prevalent at such lower levels in the tiering hierarchy was a major contributing factor here. Fail-over and new route announcements converge in similar times, while route withdrawals have far longer convergence times.\nA similar study on BGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path exploration characteristics proposed modifications to the BGP UPDATE message intended to identify and limit the path exploration behaviour of BGP [52]. If a significant level of update load is related to path exploration and a significant level of AS Path security overhead is related to validation of short-term transient routing states associated with path exploration, then another direction in terms of reducing security overheads is to limit path exploration behaviour. An approach to do so by selective damping of BGP updates that are characteristic of BGP path exploration following a withdrawal at source is described in Path Exploration Damping [53], [54].\nFurther study of BGP update behaviour has explored the level of determinism that exists in BGP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s route selection process and noted that in the absence of the Multiple Exit Discriminator (MED) and route reflectors, then the process can be considered to be a deterministic one [55]. The paper suggests some refinements to BGP that could achieve a similar outcome to MEDs and route reflectors while preserving the deterministic route selection property. The question this paper raises is that most security proposals view AS Path validation as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter the event\u00e2\u0080\u009d activity because of the assumed lack of predictability in BGP. This paper questions this basic assumption and raises the possibility of path security as a provisioning activity, which, in turn raises some interesting performance optimisations for BGP path security as a provisioning exercise rather than a reactive task.\nSecuring BGP is not only a matter of securing the control plane, but also of securing the data plane [56] and to make sure that the status of the forwarding table is consistent with the advertised BGP routing information.\nA study by Mao et al. [57] showed that up to 8% of the paths advertised through the control plane, do not match the actual paths in the data plane. The data plane is not only subject to attacks which try to subvert the routing system, but also subject to synthetic BGP announcements from network operators that could enable the theft of carriage capacity. It is therefore necessary to provide security for the whole data path, and not only on a Next Hop basis as Stealth Probing [58] intends to, as carriers might span over multiple ASes and synthesise false routing information that spans multiple AS hops.\nProposed approaches mainly focus on probing the full data-path through packet injection, trying to detect and isolate malicious routers. In \u00e2\u0080\u009csecure traceroute\u00e2\u0080\u009d [59] a modified traceroute is used to control which path data packets actually take and compares it to the actual AS path of the routing table, effectively detecting malicious ASes. Secure traceroute comes with the overhead of a PKI and related key exchange and no chance for piecemeal deployment.\nThe Faith approach [60] instead focuses on using traffic summary functions, and comparing their results with those of other routers, allowing to detect ASes which provide anomalous values. These traffic summary functions seem to be prone to inaccuracy due to a variety of applications running on routers which might alter the packet flow and their application appears infeasible in routers with very high packet volumes.\nThe solution proposed as Listen and Whisper [61] tries to detect inaccuracies in the data plane (the Listen part) but focuses also on control plane security (the Whisper part) and aims to provide an almost complete BGP security solution, combining both parts. Compared to sBGP, Listen and Whisper should be classified as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust too late\u00e2\u0080\u009d solution for BGP security, like many solutions which try to ensure data plane - control plane consistency. Like other data plane security solutions, this approach seems infeasible, as it tries to detect data plane anomalies by analysing individual TCP flows, and scaling this approach to the high speed core of the Internet presents some practical challenges.\nAn approach that aims towards high performance and possible partial deployment is described in [62]. Its focus is to ensure that the data path always conforms to the announced AS path, which is achieved by probing data paths through injecting tagged IP packets, or by using IP options. Similar to pgBGP, it leaves the decision of which action to take towards a malicious router to the network operator and builds up a small database to detect possible malicious routers. It deploys the roles of verifiers and provers on certain ASes, with the verifier being an AS that wants to verify a certain route, and the prover being an AS that helps the verifier in the process by replying on probe data.\nBased on the initial RPSEC work on security of route origination, the IESG chartered the Secure Inter-Domain Routing Working Group (SIDR) in 2006 [64]. The charter for this effort presented some issues, in that it was stalled in assuming security requirements for AS Path validation and had to await results from the RPSEC activity. Given that RPSEC was unable to agree on a requirement for AS Path security then the initial work in SIDR was concentrated on securing the origination of routing information, rather than its propagation through the inter-domain space. Notably in retrospect, SIDR was also constrained from making any changes to the BGP protocol, implying that any security framework applied to the operation of BGP was to be positioned as an overlay rather than a basic change to the BGP protocol itself. This turned out to be a very important decision as it precluded some design decisions that would turn out to be critical for the SIDR design work.\nThe initial SIDR products were a collection of specifications that described a profile for a PKI for IP addresses and AS numbers (the RPKI), as well as a model for publication and maintenance of local cache, discussed earlier in Part 1 of this survey. From this foundation the SIDR Working Group moved on to Route Origination Validation.\nRoute Origination Validation (ROV) builds upon the earlier work in the Routing Registry effort, where a prefix holder is able to publish information as to how an address prefix is to be announced into the routing system by nominating the AS number(s) that are permitted to originate a routing announcement for the prefix. In the ROV framework. In the RPKI framework this information is published as a signed Route Origin Authorization (ROA) [65] [66].\nA ROA is signed by a prefix holder, and denotes a permission given by the address prefix holder for an AS to originate a route.\nThere are a number of additional implications associated with publishing a ROA. The first is that no other AS has permission to announce that prefix when there is a cryptographically valid ROA extant in the RPKI system. If the prefix holder wishes to authorizer multiple ASes to originate a route for this prefix, then the prefix holder must generate multiple ROAs. This means that an address holder can declare that a prefix should not be routed at all by issuing a ROA that provides a permission to AS0. Secondly, the ROA denies permission for any AS to originate a prefix that his more specific than the prefix listed in the ROA. There is a MaxLength attribute of a ROA that may be used to define a range of more specific prefix lengths that are permitted by a ROA. Thirdly, there is no acknowledgement of the ROA on the part of the AS. A prefix holder may publish a ROA providing a permission to an AS who is unaware of the permission.\nThere is no symmetric instrument in the RPKI framework relating to the AS holder. An AS holder does not have the ability to issue a signed attestation that lists all the prefixes that it intends to originate in the routing system.\nThere is one more important component of the ROV framework, namely the RPKI to Router protocol (RTR) [67]. This protocol allows a crypto engine to be removed from a router and operate on a dedicated platform. The result of this local processing of ROA data is expressed in the form of a filter list, and this filter list is implemented as a shared state between a RTR server and one or more RTR client routers. This mechanism offloads most of the RPKI overheads from the router, and leaves just a residual filtering function on the router.\nTHE SIDR working group commenced work on an extension to BGP what would allow validation of the AS Path attribute in 2011, and the standard track specification of BGPsec was published in 2017 [68].\nUnlike ROV, BGPsec is not implemented in an off-router mode but is implemented through the definition of non-transitive BGP AS Path attributes. These attributes carry the digital signatures produced by the AS that propagates a BGP UPDATE message. These signatures, signed by the AS, provide confidence that every AS listed in the AS Path attribute has handled the propagation of this prefix, that the order in the AS Path is the exact order of propagation of the UPDATE message through the inter-domain routing space, and each AS listed has explicitly authorised the propagation of an UPDATE message to its eBGP peer.\nBGPsec appears to be solidly based on the concepts described in the earlier sBGP work [8]. In essence each eBGP speaker generates a digital signature that covers the information it received (including that digital signature) and the AS number to whom this UPDATE is to be sent (Figure 4).There is a wealth of detail behind this simple summary, but it can be summarised by the observation that this mechanism ties the AS Path in the UPDATE message to the sequence of ASes that handled the propagation of the route object. A detailed exposition of BGPsec\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design decisions can be found in [69].\nStepwise AS Path validation cannot tolerate AS Sets in this approach, nor AS Confederation Sets, and that are in the process of being deprecated in response to this limitation [88]. In a similar vein BGP Route Reflectors require special processing, as do private AS numbers.\nThere are a number of consequences of this design approach.\nThe first, and perhaps the most important consequence, is that piecemeal incremental deployment is simply not possible in BGPsec. When an UPDATE is passed from a BGPsec BGP speaker to a non-BGPsec BGP speaker all BGPsec attributes are lost. This means that it the UPDATE is further propagated to a BGPsec BGP speaker the initial BGPsec information is unavailable. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet the consequences of this highly constrained deployment scenario are prohibitive factors for adoption.\nThis approach also places a high crypto processing load on BGPsec-aware BGP speakers. There is some scepticism that this is a feasible impost on the Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s routing infrastructure, and this scepticism guided the design of the ROV RTR approach. However, for BGPsec not only are routers expected to process the BGPsec messages, but also hold secure private keys to perform signing on the fly for outgoing UPDATE messages.\nThirdly, while this approach can provide some assurance regarding the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccorrect\u00e2\u0080\u009d operation of the BGP protocol and can detect efforts to tamper with update messages but there is no protection against spurious WITHDRAW messages, no ability to ascertain the alignment of the route object with the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forwarding state and no protection of alignment of the UPDATE with the policy state. In other words, route leaks can still occur in BGPsec.\nIn summary, BGPsec represents a relatively high overhead to pay for a limited set of assurances and a limited protective capability. Furthermore, there is a more extreme view that BGPsec cannot achieve any of the security properties due to the fundamental design principles of BGP and BGPsec. In one research paper [70] it is asserted that in BGPsec, routes can still be hijacked, and routing loops can still appear. The paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors hope to stimulate further dialog to rethink the fundamental tenets of BGP and BGPsec designs by publishing their analysis of the observed shortcomings of BGPsec.\nThe issue with the overall SIDR approach to BGP security is that if BGPsec is impractical then we cannot rely on ROV alone. All a determined routing attacker need do is tack on the originating AS to a synthesised AS Path and any AS sequence can be placed in the AS Path attribute of a synthetic route.\nROV represents a substantial effort to get the infrastructure deployed, but without any form of AS Path protection the level of protection offered by ROV is minimal at best.  The conclusion is that ROV needs to be accompanied by some form of AS Path validation if it is to be useful.\nThere have been a number of proposals to address this shortfall. An interesting approach is Peer Lock [71], which is based on the observation that the core of the routed Internet is a small set of Tier 1 ASes, and no customer of an AS should be announcing a route where the AS Path includes any of these Tier 1 networks. Secondly, no more than 2 of these Tier 1 ASes should appear in any AS Path, if there are 2 such ASes in the AS Path they should be adjacent. This approach does not necessarily catch much in the way of deliberate efforts to generate a synthetic AS Path, but it can be effective in catching a number of common forms of route leaks, and its implementation is quite simple and very light weight.\nIn what appears to be a replay of the situation from around 2000 when soBGP was proposed as a lighter weight response to the crypto load associated with sBGP in the area of AS Path validation, there has been a proposal to use RPKI-signed AS adjacency attestations as a response to the issues with BGPsec.\nThere is a slight twist on this, however which different from soBGP, in that there is an element of routing policy that is also used in the ASPA proposal [72]. Instead of an AS listing its adjacent ASes in the inter-domain routing space and requiring both ASes to list each other as BGP neighbours before accepting the AS adjacency as valid, the ASPA framework requires an AS to list only its adjacent ASes that act in a transit provider role to the issuing AS. Given that a common criticism of BGPsec, sBGP and soBGP was that these proposals were incapable of identifying route leaks (as route leaks represent a violation of route policy as distinct from a violation of the BGP protocol itself) ASPA provides a means of identifying such route leaks.\nThe ASPA relationship is a graph fragment in the directed graph which describes the inter-AS topology [73]. The property used by the ASPA proposal is described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalley-free\u00e2\u0080\u009d AS Paths. All AS Paths can be characterised by zero or more paired relationships from Customer-to-Provider (up), zero or one Peer-to-Peer relationships (flat) and zero or more Provider-to-Customer relationships. (down). In other words, all viable AS Paths are a sequence of customer-to-provider (up) AS pairs, then a peer AS pair, then a set of provider-to-customer (down) AS pairs. Any AS sequence that contains a down then an up (or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalley) represents a customer AS leaking routes learned from one provider to another (Figure 5).\nASPA requires any AS that issues an ASPA object has to comply with the constraint that the providers listed in an AS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ASPA are the complete set of providers for that AS.\nASPA is still provide some benefit even in scenarios of partial deployment. Once an AS issues an ASPA than a routing attacker can only include this AS in a synthetic AS Path attribute if it also includes an adjacent provider AS, and the synthetic AS pair can only be inserted in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfront part\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the AS Path (Customer-to-Provider) if the order is preserved, and in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cback part\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the AS Path (Provider-to-Customer) in reverse order. Like soBGP, the use of ASPAs does not necessarily prevent the synthesis of AS Paths by a routing attacker, but it limits what can be used to make such synthetic paths, and the greater the use of ASPAs the more it becomes the case that the only AS Paths that can be synthesised are viable BGP AS Paths in any case. soBGP termed this constraint AS Path Plausibility, and the same condition applies to ASPA.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evidently still early days for ASPA and after three years the work remains a study item in the SIDROPS Working Group of the IETF. Part of the issue here is that the SIDROPS Work Group has turned its attention to the operational aspects of the operation of the RPKI and has taken on the role of the RPKI operational maintenance working group and has had its collective attention diverted from the issues of BGP security mechanisms and AS Path validation. And in the area of RPKI operations the topic that is taking up the Working Group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention is not the PKI itself, but the ongoing ramifications of the original design decision to use an out-of-band client-pull credential distribution mechanism for RPKI distribution. The emerging observation is that this original design choice is sufficiently flawed that the efforts in the working group to adjust the parameters of this distribution system will in all likelihood be unable to adequately address the operational issues that accompany scaling up the use of the RPKI credential system.\nIt may be productive at this point in time to re-open the question of how to use BGP itself to perform a just-in-time push based distribution of BGP security credentials, but within the structure of the IETF it is difficult for an operationally focussed working group to perform protocol development work. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an equally difficult ask for the IETF to reopen a protocol design effort on BGP security so soon after the closure of the original SIDR effort. The protracted and painful saga of the DNSSEC development effort in the IETF is one that many participants in the IETF are unwilling to repeat for BGP security.\nIt appears to some observers that no current solution to routing security has found an adequate balance between appropriate security and acceptable deployment overhead [74] [75], and that's an observation that I can agree with. We are just not there yet.\nCurrent research on BGP performance is focused on topics related to scalability, convergence times, stability and consistency, while the questions on security research have been focused on the integrity, authenticity, authority and verifiability of routing information. These two fields of research are inherently connected, in that a more stable routing system that was able to provide clear indications when convergence to a stable routing state had been achieved is believed to also provide clear indications of when verification of routing information is appropriate.\nIn exploring the threat model for BGP it is noted that BGP was designed to support inter-domain routing between trusted networks, while today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s networks operate in a looser confederation that does not exhibit the same mutual trust properties. Not only are the TCP sessions used by BGP vulnerable to attack, and the messages used by BGP vulnerable to alteration in order to disrupt the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s routing system, but the integrity of the operation of BGP is also threatened by misconfiguration, where incorrect information is injected into the routing system unintentionally, and by router vulnerabilities where a compromised routing system can exploit its trusted role and intentionally inject false information into the routing system.\nSome of these attacks are intended to cause a BGP speaker to be overwhelmed and reset, as BGP is a method of directly accessing a router\u00e2\u0080\u0099s processing unit and a saturation attack can cause processor and memory overload. Other attacks are aimed at altering the router\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forwarding state, generating an incorrect or unintended forwarding state for one or more prefixes. Other forms of attack are aimed at causing a BGP speaker to become unstable and thereby disrupt the forwarding function and impact on applications. A BGP session that is being continually reset will cause large local traffic bursts as neighbouring BGP speakers continually resend their routing tables upon each reset, but the continued instability will trigger a flap damping response in other BGP speakers.\nThe factors that contribute to these vulnerabilities include a lack of BGP message integrity checks, an as yet partial ability to check the authority of an originating AS to actually originate an advertisement for a prefix, and an inability to verify the accuracy, completeness and authenticity of as path attributes of a routing advertisement. The use of the RPKI to support address attestations, as in ROAs, provides a very robust means of detecting incorrect origin route objects, as long as the RPKI itself is accurately aligned to the address distribution framework and as long as the RPKI is generally, if not universally, used.\nIn contrast, robust solutions to the problem of AS Path authentication have been elusive so far. BGPsec provides a robust method of path validation but has been assessed to be significantly expensive in terms of processor and memory cost, and also detrimental to BGP convergence times and requires comprehensive adoption to be effective. Efforts to substitute AS Path plausibility in place of actual AS Path validity, as is the case with ASPA, offer a different level of robustness that appears to be more practically achievable.\nBGP has proven surprisingly resilient in terms of its longevity of useful operational life, despite early predictions of its imminent demise in favour of IDRP [12]. BGP-4 has routed the inter-domain Internet since late 1993 and the number of routed elements for the IPv4 Internet \u00e2\u0080\u0098default-free zone\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has grown from under 20,000 distinct prefixes to some 1,000,000 distinct prefixes by the middle of 2021, and a further 130,000 prefixes in the IPv6 network [10]. Despite the changes in the IPv4 address infrastructure due to exhaustion of the registry free pools the growth in the number of routing IPv4 prefixes appears to continue unabated, and together with the continued deployment of IPv6, these numbers are expected to continue to rise in the coming years.\nDue to its extensibility and large installed base, BGP-4 will likely remain the only inter-domain routing protocol in the foreseeable future for the Internet (although the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cforeseeable is prudently measured in units of years and perhaps not in decades). So far BGP has not changed in any substantive manner, including in its security properties.\nThe above views do not necessarily represent the views of the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre.\nGEOFF HUSTON AM, M.Sc., is the Chief Scientist at APNIC, the Regional Internet Registry serving the Asia Pacific region.\nwww.potaroo.net"

DUIA includes data on the socio-economic development and amenities of 86 cities. The database especially covers cities outside the West, providing new opportunities for comparative research in fields suffering from a dearth of data. DUIA addresses three concerns that have not been resolved by other databases on cities. First, we draw upon remote sensing derived data from the Atlas of Urban Expansion to more accurately define city boundaries. Second, we draw upon survey data stored in IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) to include extensive, harmonized, and disaggregated data. Third, we use open source software and share our scripts to ensure transparency and replicability. DUIA includes information on dwelling and household characteristics, educational attainment, ownership of assets and appliances, and access to amenities. We provide illustrative analyses on asset inequality and water access to demonstrate the potential for the database. Although we also identify several limitations, DUIA represents a step forward in the systematic study of inequality and amenities over time and across cities.\nCopyright:  \u00a9 2021 Ramos, Uitermark.

Although recent years have seen a proliferation of databases with city-level data, there is still a long way to go before we achieve a comprehensive and authoritative data infrastructure. It is particularly challenging to construct databases with broad international coverage since the quantity of data available and ways of measurements differ sharply between countries. As a result, databases typically include only a limited number of cities in the Global North or a limited number of variables. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt up to date to create a database with comprehensive coverage is the Global Urban Indicators Database produced by UN-Habitat.\nAlthough presently available databases provide an important and a rich source of information, they also suffer from shortcomings. First, urban databases generally assemble data from different sources, which means that data are generated according to different methods and are not fully harmonized. For instance, governments might have different ways of gauging access to improved water, which means that differences might reflect administrative procedures rather than facts on the ground. The Global Urban Indicators Database [1], the most ambitious database with coverage in the so called Global South, is a case in point as its online dashboard allows users navigate tables with unharmonized variables. Second, existing databases typically provide city-level indicators, which makes it impossible to disaggregate data, which, inter alia, severely limits the possibilities to study inequalities. For instance, while Global Urban Indicators Database does provide an estimation of the proportion of the population with access to improved water, we would not know which segments of the population have access to improved water. This is the case for most of the database initiatives, including those composed by governmental and civil society panels [2\u20134] and also for initiatives that seeks to compare cities according to its economies of scale and market size [5\u20138]. Third, besides some exceptions that prove the rule [9, 10], existing databases often do not provide access to underlying data and procedures making it impossible to replicate analyses.\nThis article introduces DUIA, the Database on Urban Inequality and Amenities, which goes some way toward addressing these issues. DUIA includes data on the socio-economic development and amenities of 86 cities from a total of 32 countries. DUIA comes with an integration protocol and code in R scripts, making both the construction of the database as a whole and specific statistical analyses fully transparent and replicable. Three considerations guided the construction of DUIA. First, we draw upon remote sensing derived data from the Atlas of Urban Expansion to define city boundaries as accurately and consistently as possible across the different countries. Second, we draw upon survey data stored in IPUMS [11] to include extensive, harmonized, and disaggregated data. Third, as we especially seek to contribute to comparative research outside the West, we developed tailor-made solutions to include Indian and Chinese cities for which data were not available in IPUMS.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The following section presents an inventory of city-level databases and briefly discusses their objectives and approaches. The third section presents the procedures adopted in DUIA. In section four, we develop some illustrative examples to demonstrate the functionalities of the database: we look at water to illustrate the potential for studying access to amenities and we look at assets to illustrate the potential for studying inequalities. We discuss DUIA\u2019s limitations as well as some opportunities in the fifth section before offering our conclusion in the sixth section.\nIn recent years various organizations have been developing comprehensive urban databases, including Africapolis, the Global Power City Index, the Brookings Global Metro Monitor, the PWC Cities of Opportunity, the Global Cities Lab Top 500, the GaWC City Classification, the JLL\u2019s City Momentum Index, the Economist\u2019s Global Livability Index, the C40 Compact of Mayors, the Metropolis Observatory, and the Urban Age Project (Table in S1 Appendix). This informational landscape gives us an unprecedented capacity to compare cities through different lenses and for different purposes. However, as the variety and complexity of the information increases, more attention to transparency in definitions and methods is necessary, especially when the goal is to include cities in countries where statistical information is less readily available. For instance, the World Council on City Data address this issue by developing standardized urban metrics, including the creation of an ISO standard-setting.\nThe most ambitious attempt to track the socio-economic development of cities across the world is probably UN-Habitat\u2019s New Urban Agenda [12]. From 2003 onwards, UN-Habitat has pioneered efforts to improve the availability and reliability of urban indicators. Currently, UN-Habitat\u2019s Global Urban Indicators Database covers 1500 cities in 132 countries with 77 indicators (as accessed in 23/05/2021 at https://urban-data-guo-un-habitat.hub.arcgis.com) many of them related to tracking progress with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). UN-Habitat makes the data freely available and provides extensive documentation. Another important quality is its sampling procedure. The basic idea behind the database is to sample 1500 cities that are representative of all cities of more than 100,000 residents in 2010, though it should be noted that the website does not give exact information on which cities were included nor does it provide aggregate statistics for the sample as a whole. Africapolis is another valuable initiative. By using remote sensing, it provides a standardized procedure for the identification and delineation of cities and towns. The Worldpop Initiative, too, uses satellite imagery to identify and delineate settlements. It combines a range of geospatial datasets to cover a wider range of variables and, importantly, is open access, providing greater opportunities for both collaboration and corroboration.\nAll databases of urban indicators face a large number of challenges in collecting reliable and comprehensive data. Here we focus on three key challenges that we have sought to resolve. The first is about the conceptual definition of \u201cthe city\u201d and the operationalization delineation of cities. National governments have very different administrative practices of defining and delineating cities, which stands in the way of having a general definition of what constitutes a city and a general strategy of delineation which areas belong to cities. The second concerns the comprehensiveness and diversity of cities. The scope of analysis will depend on the number and variety of cities that are represented in the database but adding more cities and countries typically means that researchers have to reckon with more unharmonized data. The final challenge concerns the transparency and replicability of the procedures for collecting and processing data as well as the availability of data and code. This involves the variable selection, data extraction, data compilation, and analytical outputs such as graphs and tables. The following subsections review how urban databases have addressed the challenges and explain the rationale behind DUIA.\nMost urban databases rely on administrative definitions of cities. This is problematic since administrative categories for defining and delineating cities differ greatly across countries. In addition, there is often a mismatch between the cities as administrative units and cities as functional entities. This issue has been debated extensively within the context of monitoring progress on SDGs. From 2018 onwards, UN-Habitat has been organizing a series of workshops (reports on country consultations towards a harmonized urban and rural areas definition available at https://urban-data-guo-un-habitat.hub.arcgis.com/pages/stories as accessed in accessed on 23/05/2021 with representatives of national statistical offices to discuss the possibilities for developing a global definition of cities and harmonized criteria to identify urban and rural areas. One promising avenue is to use remote sensing and gridded population data to depict urban agglomerations [13]. The major advantage of this data source is that it allows the identification of land-cover patterns in a consistent way with a planetary coverage. Leyk et al. [14] present a detailed comparison among these initiatives. Other studies use auxiliary data to indicate urbanized areas such as density and commuting flows [15]. Some urban databases, including Africapolis, incorporate remote sensing data to chart urban sprawl and land-use patterns.\nWe build on these efforts by defining using the definition and operationalization of cities in the Atlas of Urban Expansion (AUE) [16]. The objective of the AUE is to monitor urban expansion by mapping and measuring key attributes of urban expansion in three time periods through the classification and analysis of Landsat satellite imagery. AUE uses digital image processing techniques to identify the city built-up area extension, its extrema tectorum. For each city, the AUE freely provides two types of data: first, an aggregated dataset with urban morphological metrics, patterns of urban expansion, and some estimations of population size and density extracted from demographic datasets; second, georeferenced layers containing the city boundary and urban footprint as well as a collection of raster layers that resulted from the image classification process. As we explain below, we use the morphological data and georeferenced layers to match census data as closely as possible to urban areas. In brief, the matching process is possible since each household microdata sample in IPUMS can be associated to a variable that indicates the code of the second-level Enumeration Areas (EAs) where it is located. As we elaborate below, we use the georeferenced layers provided by AUE and IPUMS to select the EAs that are completely or partially covered by the Study Area defined by the AUE.\nThe criteria for including cities in databases are often implicit or vague (like \u201cthe world\u2019s largest cities\u201d). Here, again, UN-Habitat has been leading the way by proposing a method to define a representative Global Sample of Cities for the sake of comparative analysis. The method was developed in a joint initiative with the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy and New York University and has also been adopted by the AUE. The UN Sample of Cities includes 200 cities which represent 5% of the universe of 4,231 cities of over 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, comprising 70% of the world\u2019s urban population. The sample is constructed through a threefold stratification procedure that ensures that cities of all sizes, from all regions, and from large and small countries are represented. In the first step, the cities were sampled at random from eight world regions in proportion to the urban population in each region (the regions are East Asia and the Pacific; Southeast Asia; South and Central Asia; Western Asia and North Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; Europe and Japan; and Land-Rich Developed Countries). In the second step, an approximately equal number of cities were selected at random from four ranges of population size, each range containing one-quarter of the total population of the cities in the universe (the population size groups are 100,000\u2013427,000; 427,001\u20131,570,000; 1,570,001\u20135,715,000; and 5,715,001 and above). Finally, the third step observed three country groups identified by the number of cities in the country in proportion to the urban population in each group (Countries with 1\u20139 cities; 10\u201319 cities; and 20 or more cities). For DUIA, we adopt this same sample as a starting point for data compilation.\nOne of the major challenges for building urban databases is to include reliable information on relevant variables. There is typically a tradeoff between, on the one hand, using standardized procedures and, on the other hand, including a wealth of information. Africapolis and the AUE use standardized procedures to identify and delineate cities but do not include a wealth of information. The UN-Habitat database does have an array of variables but they were obtained from different sources and calculated in different ways. Despite some recent refinements in the data selection and visualization, the UN-Habitat database still lacks the capacity to replicate methodological procedures. As it is built from contributions from local urban observatories, it is almost inevitable that are significant differences in how data is processed and the availability of metadata. Information about primary data sources, formalization of calculations, and conceptual definitions are absent for several indexes and data tables. Navigating the informational content is also far from ideal since it has no clear categorization of themes of interest. As an example, a search using the tag \u2018poverty\u2019 returned only one table on poverty rates at national level (the data catalog was accessed in 23/05/2021 using the TAG \u2018poverty\u2019 as follows https://data.unhabitat.org/search?Collection=Dataset&tags=poverty) which is, according to the metadata provided, based \u201con income per capita estimated from household survey data\u2026\u201d This type of information is insufficient for an authoritative comparative analysis since differences in the household surveys, variable definitions and methodological procedures are not transparent. Moreover, since we only have access to an aggregate score on a synthetic measure, it is impossible to conduct fine-grained analysis.\nThese issues suggest that databases like DUIA need to optimize possibilities for replication. As Christensen et al. [17] suggest, replication means verification whether the specific results of the original study can be reobserved. In a broader meaning, it also means reanalysis, or whether conclusions drawn from the analysis are robust. Recent technological advancements in open source software and public repositories are expanding the possibilities replication thus understood. The World Bank\u2019s SDG Atlas is a clear example of this trend. All the calculations, graphs and maps were constructed using open source software (R and QGIS) and all the code and data are openly available in a GitHub repository [10] providing full replicability and transparency for the calculations used in the database. Similarly, initiatives such as the WordPop gridded population [18] and the OECD functional urban areas definitions [13] also made their source code and data available, mainly using R scripts and GitHub repositories. DUIA followed this model: all the data gathering used open and freely available sources and all the methodological steps were developed using R scripts available in GitHub.\nDUIA relies on two freely and easily available main sources: the IPUMS-international (IPUMS originally stood for Integrated Public Use Microdata Series). All the data we use in our analysis are derived from IPUMS-International (for simplicity we refer to IPUMS-International as IPUMS) and the Atlas of Urban Expansion. Both data sources are maintained by renowned academic institutions: the Institute for Social Research and Data Innovation at the University of Minnesota is responsible for IPUMS. The AUE is a multi-institutional initiative led by the Marron Institute of Urban Management and the Stern School of Business of New York University and developed in partnership with UN-Habitat and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.\nIPUMS in 2021 offers census data from 98 countries. IPUMS includes sample data, with sample densities ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent of national populations. Composed of microdata samples, IPUMS provides information on the individual and household level, enabling tabulations and cross-tabulations tailored for different research questions. This means, for instance, that we not only know which proportion of a city\u2019s population has access to water but also which groups lack or have access. Nationally representative samples are systematically drawn from the total enumerated population by IPUMS or national statistical offices [19] IPUMS adds extensive and integrated metadata. For our purposes, it is important that it provides GIS boundary files, making it possible to establish whether households belong to a city (as defined by the AUE; see below). Another crucial contribution by IPUMS to comparative research is the harmonization of variables, minimizing the difficulties that arise when questionnaires are not identical.\nFor some countries, the availability of microdata variables is still limited in IPUMS, precluding analysis at the individual or household level. These countries include China and India, two countries with large populations and many cities included in AUE\u2019s sample of cities. To include these two countries in DUIA, we used aggregated city-level census variables obtained directly from the respective national statistical agencies.\nFor Indian cities, we accessed aggregated data for the censuses of 2001 and 2011. The Indian Census agency maintain a web page (https://censusindia.gov.in/DigitalLibrary) where it is possible to freely download the census table by township (tehsil). It also provides census base maps as images (pdf) containing the description and extension of each tehsil. To select the tehsils that best correspond to the city boundary in AUE, we georeferenced the pdf maps and used them as background image GIS layer to identify the list of Tehsil to be included in each city through an overlay procedure.\nFor China, we obtained aggregated values calculated on a 10% sample from the 2000 and 2010 census. The Chinese census provides data for different administrative subdivision levels. We use the prefecture level data to represent cities. DUIA uses case-specific code to acquire and preprocess data on Chinese and Indian cities. Data is then integrated only at city-level in the database, allowing the comparison with the other cities in the database. While we felt it is important to include Chinese and Indian cities, we note that we unfortunately cannot do analyses at the household and individual level. In addition, for Chinese cities, we could not use the urban extension defined by the AUE.\nAll in all, DUIA includes data on 56 cities obtained from IPUMS and of an additional 30 cities in China and India, bringing the total to 86 cities, distributed over five continents. The Fig 1 maps cities included in the database. Although this a large sample with cities from many different contexts, we acknowledge that it is not representative of any population of cities. This means, inter alia, that the aggregate statistics we report below are for descriptive purposes and not meant to generalize to a particular class of cities. The real value of the database resides in the opportunity to compare cities on a comparatively wide range of variables.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g001\nThe method to assemble DUIA involves three main steps: data selection and extraction; data compilation and integration; and aggregation of city-level statistics. All data, code, and software are freely available: each step can be replicated using the R scripts accessible on the GitHub of the project and the main data providers for DUIA have all the data freely available on interactive websites. The diagram in Fig 2 offers an overview of DUIA\u2019s workflow.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g002\nThe first step consists of the data selection and extraction. We adopted the Sample of Cities as defined by the UN-Habitat and the AUE as the starting point to the sampling strategy. One key aspect of this sampling strategy is the definition of cities by their geographical extent, or \u201cas agglomerations of contiguous built-up areas (and the open spaces in and around them) that may contain a large number of municipalities but, more often than not, constitute a single labor market.\u201d [16]. For each one of the 200 cities, AUE defines the extension of the built-up area in a study area in three periods of time, around the years 1990, 2000 and 2015.\nTo match the cities as defined through AUE to the IPUMS census data, we first verify whether census data is available for the countries that have cities included in the sample. This is the case for a total of 167 cities distributed over 57 countries. The data extraction in IPUMS is done through a web-based interface that allows for a selection of samples and variables. For building DUIA, we focused on the variables that are related to the household characteristics including tenure, access to utilities (e.g. water, electricity, etc.), assets and appliances (e.g. autos, TV, etc.), and dwelling characteristics (e.g. building materials, number of rooms, etc.). There are substantial differences in terms of variable availability and spatial-temporal coverage. S2 Appendix shows the variables available for each country and period in IPUMS. After excluding cities for which very limited information was available, a total of 56 cities remained in the database.\nAmong the variables in IPUMS is a geographical code indicating the second-level subnational administrative unit in which the household was enumerated. To match the data from IPUMS and the AUE, we use an overlay procedure to see whether the second-level administrative unit is part of the city as defined by the AEU. This is straightforward when there is a perfect spatial match between the AUE study area boundaries and the second-level administrative units. S3 Appendix describes the matching for Dhaka and Mexico to explain how we treated cases where there was not a perfect spatial match. In addition to spatial matching, we need to do temporal matching. Fig 3 shows a comparison between the years of the satellite imagery used in the AUE and the year of the censuses available in IPUMS. Although there is no perfect fit, it is possible to group into three periods of analysis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g003\nThe second step in the workflow consists of the compilation of all the household samples available for each country and the selection of the samples that correspond to the second-level EA within the boundaries of the study area as defined by the AUE. This generates a series of household-level, multi-temporal sample data frames that are then merged into a unique repository, an integrated, household-level database. This database contains the information of the second-level administrative units for every household level sample, allowing some degree of intraurban analysis for most of the cities. For instance, for Mexico City, we can compare across 60 districts, for Accra among 10. Cities in the sample can subdivided into 10.2 areas on average.\nThe final step comprises the calculation of the aggregated city-level statistics from the household samples. This generates a data frame with the city as the unit of observation, which can then be integrated with the variables on urban morphology derived from the AUE. It also allows the integration of aggregated city level information available from the census data as the case for Chinese and Indian cities.\nThe outcome of the extraction and integration processes described in the previous sub-sections is an informational infrastructure consisting of (1) an aggregated city-level database publicly available via the figshare service, (2) a microdata household-level database maintained internally under access control, and (3) a collection of R codes and data extraction specifications available in a GitHub repository. The controlled access to the microdata is due to restrictions in the IPUMS policy for the use and dissemination of the microdata. However, the data extraction specification and the openly distributed R codes allow the full replication of the data extraction process and the household-level database assemblage.\nThe core of the DUIA is the microdata household-level database, a file in an R dataframe format (Rda) composed of approximately 50 million household samples that allows multivariate analysis and tailored case selections and aggregations. The openly available aggregated city-level database is compiled from the household-level database and includes all the selected harmonized variables for all the cities in different periods of time. The city-level database allows simple and direct access to 33 variables in different categories such as \u2018access to piped water\u2019, \u2018internet access\u2019 and \u2018educational attainment\u2019. It is a ready-to-use spreadsheet and does not require the use of R codes. As it has the city as the unit of observation, it allows for the integration with the tables from the AUE.\nThe R codes stored in the GitHub repository are organized in folders according to the different stages described in the DUIA\u2019s workflow (Fig 2). The first folder contains a set of country-specific codes that enables the selection of the IPUMS samples based on the geographical overlay operation described above. It uses the year-specific second-level geography shapefiles available at the IPUMS webpage and the GIS databases retrieved from the AUE. The GitHub repository further includes a set of text files describing how country samples were extracted from IPUMS to enable replication. The second folder contains the code used in the integration process that has as outcome the microdata household-level database. It outlines the operations used to make the country-specific data compatible, including standardization of variables and formatting. The third folder contains the code used to generate the aggregated city-level database. It further includes the code used in the illustrative analyses hereafter presented. The repository is open for contributions, making it possible to incorporate new R code for processing or analyses.\nThe database allows for a wide range of analyses into various kinds of inequalities and access to different kinds of amenities. Where IPUMS microdata is available, there is a possibility to conduct research at the level of the household. This represents an important quality since many of the currently available databases only present aggregate indicators and indexes. The following subsection illustrates this potential through a study of the development of inequality over time and across cities by means of an asset inequality index. The second subsection illustrates the potential of database for comparing differences in the access to amenities between and, to some extent, within cities through an analysis of differential access to piped water.\nRising inequality is one of the most pronounced and concerning trends in recent decades. There is ample evidence that, while inequalities between countries are declining as a result of fast economic growth in previously poor countries, inequalities within countries are on the rise. Cities both generate and reflect such rising inequality [20, 21] and inequality generally increases with city size [22, 23]. Marked differences in terms of wealth and income are especially pronounced in countries with weak welfare states. Some authors, like Davis [24], argue that while globally connected elites might escape poverty, the growing mass of urbanites has bleak prospects and will suffer impoverishment. However, there are also reasons why we should not expect rising inequality. Studies of informal neighborhoods have found that residents over time manage to drastically improve their material circumstances [25, 26].\nDUIA offers various opportunities to study inequality within and between cities. Here we illustrate its potential through an analysis of inequalities with respect to household assets. Household assets here refer to resources for a leading a comfortable life, including ownership of durable consumer goods (like a fridge or a television) and residence in a good dwelling (as measured by e.g. the number of rooms or the material from which it is made) [27]. One reason to look at household assets is pragmatic: in the absence of abundant and comparable data on income and wealth, it is pragmatic to focus on household assets for which information can be obtained from census data. Another reason is analytical: household assets arguably are important for wellbeing, comfort, and dignity and sharp differences in this respect represent a tangible and consequential expression of inequality. We provide tentative answers to two questions: is inequality in terms of household assets growing or decreasing? And, is household asset inequality greater in cities than in the countries they are part of?\nThe household asset index is based on variables related to homeownership, dwelling amenities, building material, and ownership of consumer durables. The census data available in IPUMS covers most of these dimensions but with differences among countries. On average, the dataset contains 15 variables covering household assets. We used as many variables as possible in our calculations and included only those cases where more than 10 indicators were available. All the variables we use are binary except for the number of rooms per person, which we calculated by dividing the household size by the numbers of room in their residence. The harmonization process applied by IPUMS makes it straightforward to use the variables but the binarization of many of the variables demanded ad hoc coding for each country. S2 Appendix provides an overview of the variables used for the calculation of the index for each country.\nThe graphs included in Fig 4 show the inequality index for 36 cities and their countries (in red). Most cities\u2013 30 out of 36 \u2013show a decrease in inequality over time; a remarkable finding in light of research documenting drivers and patterns of growing income and wealth inequality. Moreover, we find very little evidence that the development of cities is disconnected from their national context (cf. [21]): there is a correlation coefficient of 0.88 between the city-level and country-level inequality index, indicating that the development of city-level inequality tracks country-level inequality. The only exception is Valledupar, a city in the north of Colombia, where inequality increased despite the overall decrease observed in the country. To the extent that there are differences in the evolution of inequality between cities in the nations in which they are situated, the average annual variation rate of the asset index for all the cities in the sample is-1.1, and for the countries the average annual variation is slightly slower, -0.97.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g004\nOn average, the decrease in inequality was most significant among African cities with an average annual rate variation of -1.6 percent per year, followed by the Mexican cities with -1.2 percent per year, South American cities with -1.1 percent per year, and Philippian cities with -0.8 percent per year (see Fig 5).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g005\nFig 6 presents changes in the Asset Inequality Index over time. In our sample, the Ugandan capital Kampala shows the sharpest growth in inequality with an average increase of 2.3 percent per year, which is still lower than the increase in inequality in the country of Uganda as a whole (3.2 percent per year). The second highest rate was observed in the Columbian city of Valledupar, with a growth in inequality of 2.1 percent per year, which contrasts with the trend toward equality at the national level, suggesting that there must be specific local factors at play. The group of cities with decreasing asset inequality\u2013 80 percent of the sample\u2013shows even more marked change. Both the Rwandan capital of Kigali and Alexandria in Egypt show annual decreases in the inequality index of 4 percent.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g006\nAlthough there are several cities that exhibit greater inequality, it is remarkable that our findings suggest that changes in the opposite direction\u2013toward greater equality\u2013predominate in most cities in our sample. Considering that cities are often seen as magnifiers of inequality, it is noteworthy that we find that trends for cities and countries are generally remarkably similar. Since we here discuss a specific kind of inequality (in terms of households\u2019 assets) for a specific sample of cities (those for which we have sufficient data), we do not intend to generalize from our findings. Nevertheless, our findings do minimally suggest that, at least in some domains and in some cases, there are trends toward equality that have received scant attention in the literature.\nSecure access to potable water is a life necessity but far from self-evident for a large proportion of the world\u2019s population. It is listed as one of the SDGs and has been receiving the attention of a vast amount of studies and analysis. DUIA offers a framework for studying how access to water develops over time and across different cities on the basis of census data. To illustrate its potential, we conduct an exploratory comparative analysis using IPUMS\u2019 harmonized variable for water provision (WATSUP), which \u201cdescribes the physical means by which the housing unit receives its water. The primary distinction is whether or not the household had piped (running) water.\u201d (According to the metadata available at https://international.ipums.org/international-action/variables/WATSUP#description_section). Although IPUMS includes information to distinguish various kinds of water access, for the sake of comparing across a range of cities and over time we here distinguish two basic categories: \u2018piped water\u2019 and \u2018no piped water.\u2019 For the first period, we have data for 31 cities, for the second on 33 cities, and for the third on 26 cities. We aggregate the household microdata to the level of the city using the weighting variable (the weighting variable\u2014HHWT or household weight\u2014indicates the number of households in the population represented by the household in the sample). Since IPUMS data on water provision is not available for China and India, we included aggregate census data obtained directly from the respective official statistical agencies for 13 Indian and 21 Chinese cities.\nThe collection of graphs for the 86 cities presented in Fig 7 show the evolution at a glance. While there is substantial variation in trajectories and levels of piped water provision, there is a general trend in the direction of increasing access. On average, the cities in the sample had 74% coverage of piped water in the most recent period covered by the sample, representing an increase in 4 percentage points in comparison to the previous period.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g007\nGrouping the cities by continent (Fig 8), we see that Latin-American cities have steadfastly expanded access to piped water and reached almost universal coverage in the last period of analysis. African and Asian cities show much greater variation. Some cities achieve universal coverage, but others see access to piped water reduced. The drop in access for cities in the Philippines is noteworthy: Manila decreased from 73 percent coverage in 1990 to 57 percent in 2014 and Cebu from 50 percent to 33 percent in the same period.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.g008\nSo far, we illustrated the potential of DUIA for macroscopic analysis, providing a broad overview of developments across a wide range of cases. For such broad analyses it is necessary to reduce complexity, for instance, by transforming variables into dummies and ignoring variations at the sub-city level. When the analysis focuses on specific cities or countries, however, it is possible to conduct more fine-grained analysis.\nAlthough DUIA makes some important steps, the database also suffers from a number of limitations. First of all, there is a trade-off between, on the one hand, representativeness and, on the other hand, reliable, comparable, and granular data. Whereas UN-Habitat\u2019s sampling strategy for the Global Urban Indicators Database optimizes for representativeness, DUIA prioritizes reliable, comparable, and granular data. This choice means that the sample of cities in DUIA is not representative and can at best be used to approximate general trends. Second, the data in DUIA is as good as the censuses from which they are sourced. The censuses differ in terms of coverage, are conducted in different moments in time, and generally lack information on e.g. beliefs and values or income and expenditures. A third limitation is that DUIA requires considerable computational power since the data are processed from the census samples. For instance, the computation underlying the analysis of the household asset index for cities and countries took several days. A fourth limitation is that the possibilities of conducting analysis at the sub-city level are restricted by the level of geographical aggregation available in IPUMS. For some cities, like Mexico City or S\u00e3o Paulo, it is possible to identify dozens of city districts but access to the complete census (instead of a sample) would allow for a much more detailed analysis. This, however, would require a massive storage system and specific statistical procedures to preserve anonymity of the data. Although IPUMS includes only a sample, the tradeoff is that it has solved these logistical issues.\nConsidering these and other limitations, we do not want to suggest that DUIA is a silver bullet for comparative research. Depending on the questions at hand, DUIA can be useful. While we focused on access to piped water, DUIA also offers the opportunity to study access to e.g. internet or electricity. And while we above studied inequality in terms of households assets, DUIA also contains data to study inequality in terms of other factors like educational attainment. Perhaps even more promising, it is possible to conduct multivariate analyses, examining, for instance, to what degree educational attainment correlates with household assets or access to amenities. In other front, the access of harmonized multitemporal microdata level opens opportunities in more detailed comparative analysis including typologies of urban development\u2019s pathways in association to urban growth analysis. Considering the large number of microdata observations available, robust econometric models can be applied to identify trends and inferences including differences-in-differences-type and propensity-score-matching strategies. In short, DUIA offers a number of additional opportunities relative to other databases.\nAlthough the coverage and reliability of much of the data will continue to depend on painstaking endeavors like taking censuses [28], the processing and analysis of data is greatly enhanced by innovations in data processing, cloud computing, collaborative platforms for code sharing, and open source software. As one of many examples of issues that could be resolved through technological advances, consider that, at present, we only can disaggregate census data to the administrative units that are used in the census. The incorporation of remote sensing data and machine learning classification for disaggregating census data is certainly one of the most promising developments ahead with already good results such as the Wordpop gridded population [18]. The so-called dasymetric mapping approach they developed could serve as a basis to expand the downscaling of the variables of interest. If integrated with field observations and sampling, these methods could overcome the reliance on administrative units in censuses and integrate remote sensing in urban databases. DUIA offers a wide range of potential future applications. The most obvious is its use in urban benchmarking initiatives such as the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At present, the monitoring of SDGs depends on unharmonized variables, limiting the potential for research over time and especially across space.\nAs Acuto and Pejic [29] argue, the global proliferation of city benchmarking initiatives demands critical reflection and constructive engagement from academics. By introducing transparency and replicability in analytical methods, DUIA potentially represents an important initiative to engage collaborative efforts in this direction. DUIA seeks to add to presently available city-level databases by offering opportunities for detailed, replicable, and comprehensive research through extensive metadata, granular primary data, and replicable analysis. The database especially covers cities outside the West, providing new opportunities for comparative research in fields suffering from a dearth of data. We illustrate the potential of DUIA by examining inequality in household assets and access to piped water across a large sample of cities. Although these analyses are exploratory and show marked variation across cities, overall the trends we observe are in the direction of decreasing inequality and greater access.\nWe acknowledge that DUIA suffers from several limitations. Arguably, the database is not sufficiently detailed for fine-grained case study research and not sufficiently comprehensive for generalizations. Nevertheless, DUIA makes a number of important steps in overcoming obstacles to comparative research. In particular, it offers new opportunities for the examination of broad trends over time through comparatively reliable data and with transparent, replicable procedures.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.s001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.s002\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253824.s003\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the statistical offices that provided the underlying data making this research possible: National Institute of Statistics and Censuses, Argentina; National Institute of Statistics, Bolivia; Institute of Geography and Statistics, Brazil; National Institute of Statistics, Chile; National Bureau of Statistics, China; National Administrative Department of Statistics, Colombia; National Institute of Statistics and Censuses, Ecuador; Department of Statistics and Censuses, El Salvador; Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, Egypt; Central Statistical Agency, Ethiopia; Bureau of Statistics, Fiji; Ghana Statistical Services, Ghana; National Statistical Office, Greece; Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India; National Directorate of Statistics and Informatics, Mali; BPS Statistics Indonesia, Indonesia; National Bureau of Statistics, Kenya; National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics, Mexico; Department of Statistics, Morocco; National Institute of Statistics, Mozambique; National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria; National Statistics Office, Philippines; National Institute of Statistics, Rwanda; Statistics South Africa, South Africa; National Institute of Statistics, Spain; Central Bureau of Statistics, Sudan; Bureau of Statistics, Tanzania; National Statistical Office, Thailand; Turkish Statistical Institute, Turkey; Bureau of Statistics, Uganda; National Institute of Statistics, Venezuela; and Central Statistics Office, Zambia.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback."

                    "value": "Photograph by Nathaniel St. Clair\nPredictions are difficult to make, especially, as the old joke goes, when they are about the future. Particularly fraught have been predictions of the demise of capitalism. Conventional wisdom would have us believe that because capitalism remains the world\u2019s dominant economic system, predictions of the system\u2019s demise are not only wrong, but destined to be wrong in the future.\n\u201cConventional wisdom\u201d here, of course, is nothing more than a display of the axiom that the intellectual ideas of a society are those of the dominant class. Certainly, both industrialists and financiers would like us to believe that nothing fundamental can change. Bourgeois ideology proclaims that through every possible channel every day.\nYet what is of human creation is not permanent; everything of human creation has an expiration date. Capitalism will be no different.\nWhen will capitalism be transcended and what will follow? That central question has been asked for two centuries and, given the increasing intensity of economic crises, mounting inequality and looming environmental catastrophe, is as important as ever. The unending series of protests, uprisings and movements dedicated to either forcing systemic reform or outright replacement are eloquent testament to how capitalism fails most of the world\u2019s population.\nNonetheless, there is no arguing that capitalism remains firmly in the saddle, with no existing social movement anywhere near strong enough today to put the system at risk. Does that mean we should regard past predictions of capitalism\u2019s demise as mistaken or wishful thinking? Perhaps only an ambiguous answer, at least preliminary, is appropriate. For those who wish to see capitalism continue indefinitely \u2014 those who benefit and those so frightened by propaganda that anything else is literally unimaginable \u2014\u00a0there is an easy answer: Yes. For those who wish for a better world, an economic system based on human need and in harmony with the environment, the answer is no.\nWhether yes, no, maybe or let\u2019s wait and see, an examination of why predictions of capitalism\u2019s demise are thus far off the mark is a healthy exercise. I thus was interested in a new book wrestling with these issues,\u00a0Foretelling the End of Capitalism: Intellectual Misadventures since Karl Marx\u00a0by Francesco Boldizzoni.\u00a0Foretelling\u00a0is a curious hybrid as the author is quite critical of capitalism but also has a pessimistic outlook regarding its replacement; it is rare for a book to receive praise from a\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reviewer and\u00a0New Left Review\u00a0contributor Wolfgang Streeck.\u00a0Foretelling\u00a0provides a strong challenge to the thinking of critics of capitalism and those who subscribe to leading theories, particularly Marxist, of the end of capitalism.\nSuch a challenge is healthy, and those who are interested in a basic history of economic thought for the past 200 years would do well with this book. Whether it succeeds in its core intention, however, is a separate matter, although any conclusions will partly depend on a reader\u2019s perspective.\nWe get a good sense of Professor Boldizzoni\u2019s perspective in his introduction, where he writes that capitalism will end, or slowly turn into something new, like all products of history, although there is no guarantee it will be something better. The brutality of prior systems lives on in capitalism. The slow growth rates of a more service-oriented economy has led to more \u201cdistributional conflicts,\u201d and the Left must find effective tools to deal with it or the \u201cpopulist right\u201d will take its place. To all but capitalism\u2019s more fervent apologists, this can hardly be considered controversial. But we also read here a foreshadowing of pessimism with a passage declaring \u201cthis battle to \u2018overthrow the system\u2019 is lost from the start\u201d \u2014 believing it raises false hopes and thus \u201cdoes not do progressivism any service.\u201d\nCapitalism isn\u2019t going anywhere in the near future and past predictions have not been borne out, so a hard look, if we are intellectually honest, is warranted. It is healthy to have ideas challenged, so let us engage with these ideas.\nBefore getting to the heart of its argument, the first four of the six chapters of\u00a0Foretelling the End of Capitalism\u00a0are a wide-ranging survey of thinkers from the early 19th century to the early 21st, across the full political spectrum. These are not deep excavations but do provide basic understandings. These are mostly solid introductions to the evolution of thinking on the topic of political economy and important theories that have arisen, except for weaknesses with some Marxist writers. For example, a brief discussion of fin de si\u00e8cle German social democracy \u2014 Eduard Bernstein vs. Karl Kautsky vs. Rosa Luxemburg \u2014 is shallow; the author only sees the surface of Kautsky\u2019s writings and does not grasp what lies below the surface, nor how to interpret the evolution of Kautsky\u2019s thinking, without which it is impossible to understand why Kautsky would come to draw close to Bernstein, an outcome the book entirely misses.\nThat is no more than a minor point. More serious is what this reviewer considers among the most bizarre interpretations of fascism he has ever come across. Professor Boldizzoni writes that fascism, or more specifically, Nazism, was \u201cthe middle ground between the liberal and Soviet worlds.\u201d He presents the ideas of several writers on fascism, but all but one are hopelessly confused and serve only to obfuscate. Incredibly, there is not one word from Leon Trotsky, the preeminent analyzer of Nazism during the 1930s \u2014 an inexcusable omission. Nor is the orthodox communist conception as handed down by Josef Stalin presented. Although that conception was badly mistaken with tragic circumstances, it should have been discussed, given the consequences of that line being put into action.\nIt is true that fascism is notoriously difficult to diagnose, but if approached from a class standpoint, it becomes understandable. At its most basic level, fascism is a dictatorship established through and\u00a0maintained with terror on behalf of big business. It is a phenomenon squarely at the far right of the political spectrum, it is not an ersatz \u201cthird way\u201d precursor. Fascist movements have a social base, which provides support and the terror squads, but which is badly misled since the fascist dictatorship operates decisively against the interest of its social base, rooted in middle class white-collar professionals and small business owners. (That is still true today; look at the profile of the Trump followers who have been arrested for participating in the January 6 attack on the U.S. capitol building.)\n\u201cIn National Socialism, everything is as contradictory and as chaotic as in a nightmare,\u201d\u00a0Trotsky wrote in a vivid 1932 essay, using the intentionally misleading formal name for the Nazis. \u201cHitler\u2019s party calls itself socialist, yet it leads a terroristic struggle against all socialist organizations. It calls itself a worker\u2019s party, yet its ranks include all classes except the proletariat. It hurls lightning bolts at the heads of capitalists, yet is supported by them. \u2026 The whole world has collapsed inside the heads of the petit bourgeoisie, which has completely lost its equilibrium. This class is screaming so clamorously out of despair, fear and bitterness that it is itself deafened and loses sense of its words and gestures.\u201d\nMilitarism, extreme nationalism, the creation of enemies and scapegoats, and, perhaps the most critical component, a rabid propaganda that intentionally raises panic and hate while disguising its true nature and intentions under the cover of a phony populism, are among the necessary elements. Despite national differences that result in major differences in the appearances of fascism, the class nature is consistent. Big business is invariably the supporter of fascism, no matter what a fascist movement\u2019s rhetoric contains, and is invariably the beneficiary even though its beneficiaries will not directly control the dictatorship; it is a dictatorship\u00a0for\u00a0them, not\u00a0by\u00a0them. The massive profits pocketed by industrialists in Hitler\u2019s Germany, Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Pinochet\u2019s Chile and elsewhere speak volumes, as do the draconian anti-labor laws implemented. Fascism is capitalism stripped of all democratic veneers.\nNonetheless, these early chapters are useful for other theorists who are discussed, including John Stuart Mill, Joseph Schumpeter, John Maynard Keynes, J\u00fcrgen Habermas and several writers of the late 20th century. The author skillfully dismantles the apologia for capitalism\u2019s inequality offered by publicists masquerading as economists. In the final two chapters, Professor Boldizzoni explicates his core arguments. Here we find no illusions about the nature of capitalism nor misunderstandings of its social relations. Capitalism is a socio-economic system, not a type of economic activity, imposed by force; an \u201cinstitutionalized social order\u201d in which even human labor is reduced to a commodity. Capitalism is kept together through hierarchy and individualism, upholding new forms of previous master/slave and lord/serf relations.\nSo why have forecasts of capitalism\u2019s demise been so far off the mark thus far? Or, perhaps, we might better phrase this question as: Why does capitalism persist despite the misery and opposition it continually spawns?\u00a0Foretelling the End of Capitalism\u00a0begins to answer this question by offering three factors \u2014 \u201ccognitive distortions that affect the forecasting process,\u201d faults in the construction of social theories and, decisively, \u201cthe faith in progress that underlies modern thought.\u201d This is further teased out through two mistakes \u2014 overgeneralization through drawing overly broad conclusions or magnifying specific events and \u201cblack and white thinking,\u201d an example of which is ignoring that there are \u201cmany varieties\u201d of capitalism. Seeing the next system only in terms of the negatives of capitalism and, finally, a misunderstanding of culture underlie mistaken forecasts, the book asserts.\nAll this comes down to \u201ccognitive distortions\u201d and \u201ctheoretical flaws,\u201d working together and in conjunction with \u201ca more general mental disposition\u201d common to those who attempt to predict what may happen in the future. \u201cThe entire history of social forecasting and its mistakes is intertwined with faith in progress,\u201d Professor Boldizzoni writes. All of his reasons are psychological. There is nothing material!\nThis is the reasoning of someone who believes the current world is the only possible world that can be, whether that belief is conscious or hidden in the unconscious. Capitalism has not fallen; therefore those who forecast its eventual end are dreamers outside reality. It is as if there are no material reasons for the continued life of capitalism, some of which have to do with the very pillars of capitalism that the author himself explicates well.\nIt is certainly possible to draw up a list of theoretical failings far more specific than flawed enlightenment thinking. No single or small group of developments can possibly encompass all the factors that have kept the world economic system in place. I have previously written that no serious discussion of this question, however,\u00a0should exclude these factors:\n* The early pioneers of the socialist movement seriously underestimated the ability of capitalism as a system to adapt and therefore did not foresee the ability of working people to extract concessions for themselves.\n* The early pioneers failed to understand the buoying effect that would be provided by imperialism (for the leading capitalist countries).\n* Many of the early pioneers clung to an overly mechanical (mis)understanding of social development that led to a passive belief in an automatic unfolding of revolution that implied, incorrectly, that powerful capitalists would simply sit back and allow themselves to be overthrown. (Kautsky and Bernstein are emblematic here.)\n* Many leaders during the Soviet era continued to hold to a similar overly mechanical belief in future revolution while at the same time failing to grasp the nuances of capitalist development.\n* An overly centralized world movement that retarded the theoretical developments needed for local conditions, blocking the creation of innovative leadership while at the same time discouraging existing local leaderships from attempting revolutions.\n* A too narrow conception of \u201cworking class\u201d or \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 a tendency to visualize only blue-collar manual workers as working people, a declining percentage of the population in increasingly technological capitalist societies. Such narrow horizons served to exclude a large proportion of wage workers, with the result that movements purporting to be organizations of working people instead divided them at the start.\nI am under no illusion that the above list exhausts the catalogue of factors. Obviously, the ability and willingness of the governments over which capitalists hold decisive sway to use violence to keep industrialists and financiers in power; the ability to disseminate propaganda in a variety of forms through an array of media, schools and institutions; and the willingness to invade, overthrow and impose military violence and sanctions against any country that challenges capitalism\u2019s masters so as to make life there difficult are indispensable factors as to capitalism\u2019s staying power. The last of this paragraph\u2019s factors goes a long way in itself as to why alternatives to capitalism have faltered.\nEvery attempt at constructing a post-capitalist economy has been met with overwhelming military, financial and other forms of force, putting them on a war footing. We can not know what might have been created if those countries had been allowed to peacefully develop, and this factor is indispensable if we are to seriously ponder the acceptance of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d propaganda. Despite the acknowledgements of bourgeois culture\u2019s orientation toward wealth accumulation and cultural processes,\u00a0Foretelling the End of Capitalism\u00a0offers lectures on the weaknesses of enlightenment thinking rather than analyzing material conditions.\nProfessor Boldizzoni puts forth the thesis that political, economic and social structures are all held together by \u201ca powerful glue\u201d: culture. Capitalism, he writes, is the product of a particular Western family of cultures, with hierarchy and individualism the most important factors. Behavior standards \u201cchange slowly\u201d; it \u201cmay take several centuries\u201d for culture to transform. He writes, \u201cThe emergence of a new system will be possible when the circumstances under which the old one was formed have eventually ceased to exist. It will reflect the changes in the material circumstances as well as in the culture sphere that are to occur over the next few centuries. The transition, however, will be so gradual that it will be barely noticeable.\u201d\nThere is plenty to unpack in the preceding paragraph. That culture is a \u201cpowerful glue\u201d keeping capitalism is indisputable, and that changes in \u201cmaterial circumstances\u201d will facilitate a transition to a new system is also not in dispute. But these assertions, which certainly would not be controversial to a Marxist, are odd in light of the author\u2019s criticisms of Karl Marx. It is unavoidable to note that those criticisms are rooted in a shallow understanding of Marx\u2019s body of work. The author makes the common mistake of seeing Marxism as overly mechanical, teleological and offering a \u201cperfect society,\u201d nor does he grasp the subtlety of the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat,\u201d admittedly a confusing phrase that might better be retired. (\u201cDictatorship of the proletariat\u201d simply means the predominance of working people, the vast majority of people in capitalist society, without reference to any particular governmental form. All capitalist societies constitute a \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie,\u201d the predominance of industrialists and financiers, which has taken many forms, including formal democracy and fascist.)\nThese misunderstandings are possible because Marxism\u2019s 20th century practitioners in the Soviet bloc presented it in overly simplified terms, seeing it themselves in a mechanical manner. And that was not new. Friedrich Engels, in an\u00a01890 letter to Joseph Bloch, lamented that he and Marx had put so much emphasis on economics. \u201cMarx and I are ourselves partly to blame for the fact that younger writers sometimes lay more stress on the economic side than is due to it,\u201d Engels wrote. \u201cWe had to emphasize this main principle in opposition to our adversaries, who denied it, and we have not always had the time, the place or the opportunity to allow the other elements involved in the interaction to come into their rights. \u2026 Unfortunately, however, it happens only too often that people think they have fully understood a theory and can apply it without more ado from the moment they have mastered its main principles, and those even not always correctly.\u201d\nWe can conceptualize\u00a0Marxist materialist philosophy like this: The flow and movement of any phenomenon or idea takes varying directions, and far from always in an expected direction. As the concept of \u201cflow\u201d implies, history and social development do not consist of discrete steps or stages. Philosophical, political and religious ideas (which are built on the materials of their predecessors); the prevailing culture (which include traditions shaped in the conditions of the past that have survived into the present); and local geographic factors influence not only each other but also influence economic conditions. What was a cause can become an effect, and an effect can become a cause. These forces are given concrete form within a state, the form of which (including its legal structure) is based on the material conditions of life \u2014 the economic structure is the foundation on which society is built and which therefore shapes social consciousness.\nProperly understood, Marxism is not, and has never been, a reach for utopia; its founders were scornful of the utopians of their time. Still more puzzling is Professor Boldizzoni\u2019s bizarre aside that Swedish social democrats were \u201cseeking the achievement of a perfect society.\u201d That would certainly be news to them. The\u00a0post-World War II Swedish model\u00a0sought full employment, equality and the transfer of excess profits to the collective ownership of employees. Better than ordinary capitalism and envisioned as an evolutionary route to a future socialist society, but hardly nirvana.\nNordic social democracy is what the author seems to have in mind when he references \u201cmany varieties\u201d of capitalism. Yes, there are national differences in capitalism, sometimes significant, but given the domination of the United States and its ability to\u00a0dictate to the rest of the world, it is unrealistic to see that there is anything other than a single world system. And Swedish capitalism is far removed from any \u201cperfect society\u201d \u2014\u00a0dominated by corporate power and subject to the pressures of corporate globalization the same as other small or midsized capitalist country, Sweden today has inequality and poverty levels above the European Union average.\nSweden\u2019s failure to institute even the most rudimentary beginnings of an evolutionary path to a socialist economic democracy under the 1970s \u201cMeidner plan\u201d of forcing companies to issue stock to public agencies until the public had majority control succumbed not only to the might of local capitalists and the pressures of corporate globalization, but because of the failure of working people to organize. Without a massive movement, no project of socialism, or, if you prefer, economic democracy, can succeed.\nIf we believe the world can\u2019t be better, that it can\u2019t be meaningfully changed, that we have no choice other than tinkering around the edges as capitalism destroys the environment, then nothing will get better. Our conditions will actually get worse because there is no stasis. A better world is possible and speculating on what some basic concepts of a better world might look like is necessary if we are to get there. Giving up is not an option. Study of material conditions and the multitude of factors as to why predictions of capitalism\u2019s demise have yet to come to pass \u2014 or, to put it in a better way, why capitalism has proven so resilient \u2014\u00a0are indispensable to achieving an understanding of our present and providing ourselves with the tools necessary to build the movement of movements, working across borders, that is the path toward any possible better world. Lamenting the weight of enlightenment thinking isn\u2019t that route.\nForetelling the End of Capitalism\u00a0is correct that there\u00a0won\u2019t be a sudden collapse\u00a0of capitalism. If no social movement intervenes, capitalism has several more decades of life and would likely be followed by something worse, in a world of environmental disaster, rising seas and dwindling resources. Decades, not centuries \u2014\u00a0the present path of humanity is unsustainable.\u00a0There is no substitute for a post-capitalist future, and the past need not dictate the future.\nAs always, the value of a book isn\u2019t measured by whether we agree with everything in it. If\u00a0Foretelling\u00a0didn\u2019t have much of interest to offer, I wouldn\u2019t have written this essay. The question the book attempts to answer is a challenge that must be confronted because it is a question that remains all too relevant. But although the author in good faith sought to interrogate the predictions of the past to provide an understanding of today, he instead produced a cry of defeat and despair.\nPete Dolack\u00a0writes the\u00a0Systemic Disorder\u00a0blog and has been an activist with several groups.

Consortium lead author: James LN Wood, email: jlnw2@cam.ac.uk\nBovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important disease for dairy productivity, as well as having the potential for zoonotic transmission. Previous prevalence studies of bTB in the dairy sector in central Ethiopia have suggested high prevalence, however, they have been limited to relatively small scale surveys, raising concerns about their representativeness. Here we carried out a cross sectional one-stage cluster sampling survey taking the dairy herd as a cluster to estimate the prevalence of bTB in dairy farms in six areas of central Ethiopia. The survey, which to date is by far the largest in the area in terms of the number of dairy farms, study areas and risk factors explored, took place from March 2016 to May 2017. This study combined tuberculin skin testing and the collection of additional herd and animal level data by questionnaire to identify potential risk factors contributing to bTB transmission. We applied the single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test using >4mm cut-off for considering an individual animal as positive for bTB; at least one reactor animal was required for a herd to be considered bTB positive. Two hundred ninety-nine dairy herds in the six study areas were randomly selected, from which 5,675 cattle were tested. The overall prevalence of bTB after standardisation for herd-size in the population was 54.4% (95% CI 48.7\u201360%) at the herd level, and it was 24.5% (95% CI 23.3\u201325.8) at the individual animal level. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with herd and area as random effect was used to explore risk factors association with bTB status. We found that herd size, age, bTB history at farm, and breed were significant risk factors for animals to be SICCT positive. Animals from large herds had 8.3 times the odds of being tuberculin reactor (OR: 8.3, p-value:0.008) as compared to animals from small herds. The effect of age was strongest for animals 8\u201310 years of age (the oldest category) having 8.9 times the odds of being tuberculin reactors (OR: 8.9, p-value:<0.001) compared to the youngest category. The other identified significant risk factors were bTB history at farm (OR: 5.2, p-value:0.003) and cattle breed (OR: 2.5, p-value: 0.032). Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of bTB in central Ethiopia but with a large variation in within-herd prevalence between herds, findings that lays an important foundation for the future development of control strategies.\nCopyright:  \u00a9 2021 Almaw et al.

The disease is prevalent in most of Africa, parts of Asia and the Americas, and in several European countries. Many industrialised countries have managed to reduce or eliminate bTB in their livestock sectors through test-and-slaughter, however significant pockets of infection remain in wildlife [1]. In Africa the disease is endemic due to a lack of control measures. This has economic implications for the growth of the livestock sector, especially the dairy sector, and poses the risk of zoonotic TB transmission which is exacerbated by the existence of concomitant infections such as HIV/AIDS [2]. In Ethiopia, the demand for milk is expanding rapidly due to increased urbanization and population pressure; Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa with an estimated population of 110 million people [3]. Since the introduction of intensive dairy farming in central Ethiopia in the 1950s to provide the Emperor and his establishment with milk, the dairy sector has steadily increased. This increase has accelerated during the last 30 years\u2014trying to meet the demand from increased urbanization and the need to supply milk and milk products to the city dwellers [4]. Although the dairy sector is most developed in central Ethiopia, urban centers across the country have more recently seen an increase in dairy farming. This most developed dairy belt in Ethiopia is expected to be challenged with diseases of intensification such as bTB [5, 6]. This is believed to be associated with mainly two factors: Firstly, a shift from dairy herding with existing local zebu cows to crosses of exotic breeds (mainly Holstein Friesian cows), which produce higher milk yields, have established dairy herds that are likely to be more susceptible to bTB [7, 8]. Secondly, an intensified dairy sector with larger herds has likely increased disease transmission as bTB is thriving in an environment with higher density population. bTB animal prevalence recorded in Ethiopia has ranged from around 3% in smallholder production systems (rearing mainly zebu cattle) up to 48% in intensive dairy productions [5, 7, 9\u201311] and the national average recently estimated to be ~ 5.8% [12].\nTschopp and colleagues [13] estimated (simulated) the cost of bTB for the urban dairy production in central Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) to have ranged from US$500,000\u20134.9 million over a period of six years (2005\u20132011). One target for the Ethiopian government in its 2015\u20132020 Livestock Master Plan is to transform the dairy sector by increasing the number of crossbred cattle by almost eight times the base-year number [14]. Such expansion comes however with a risk since transmission of infectious diseases, such as bTB, is likely to thrive by intensification [12, 15]. This also raises the concern that bTB may spread to the emerging dairies in the regional towns through trading of high milk yield animals from infected farms in the central regions.\nPrevious bTB prevalence studies in this part of Ethiopia were surveys of smaller scale (significantly fewer farms or fewer study areas) and conducted over different time periods and study areas, leading to concerns about representativeness. Accordingly, there is likely to have been over/under representation of dairy farms in past surveys due to lack of either appropriate stratified sampling or standardisation of the results [10]. A comprehensive review of bTB in Ethiopia by Sibhat et al. [12] showed limitations of previous prevalence studies, central Ethiopia included, including the scope of study objectives, methodology used, target population and geographic coverage. Therefore we carried out a large scale systematically stratified survey to assess the current status of bTB prevalence in the established dairy sector in central Ethiopia and to identify contributing risk factors for the spread of the disease to inform the development of potential control strategies.\nSix study areas were purposefully selected in the urban areas of central Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa city, and Sebeta, Holeta, Sululta, Sendafa and Bishoftu towns (Fig 1). Central Ethiopia, which includes the study areas, was a pioneer for the modern dairy development in Ethiopia with the first number of exotic dairy cattle arriving in the early 1950s as a donation from the United Nations [4] and this area has then over decades established itself as the most developed dairy belt in Ethiopia. The study areas are currently the main milk suppliers for people in Addis Ababa and the surrounding peri-urban areas. A free software program called Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) version 3.8 [16] was used for compiling the maps. Administrative and road data were extracted and complied from publicly available information of Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia [17] and Ethiopian Roads Authority [18].\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.g001\nThis study was a cross sectional study conducted from March 2016 to May 2017. Lists of herds (the sampling frame) were established at the start of the study in collaboration with district veterinary officers in respective study sites. The term \u201cherd\u201d was used to describe the group of cattle that are housed on a holding at the time of data collection [19]. Herds, with the purpose of producing milk and dairy products, having five or more cattle were included and a list of 1,323 herds was established as a sampling frame. The herds were classified as small [5\u201320], medium [21\u201337], and large herds [38\u2013168] (168 being the largest herd size in the studied herds) [5].\nInclusion and exclusion criteria for the study herds: Herd size was the criteria used and herds with less than five animals were excluded.\nSample size was determined using the following formula (that assumes a large population) following one-stage cluster sampling method taking dairy herd as a cluster [20] and every animal in the selected cluster was tested.\nUsing the assumed parameter values gives an estimated sample size of 383 farms. This was adjusted down using a small population correction (below) to 298.\nHence, we tested 299 herds out of 1323 registered herds in the study sites and selection of each herd was random. All animals in the 299 herds (5,675 animals) were tested excluding animals less than 6 weeks of age and pregnant cattle \u22658 months pregnant.\nFor herd recruitment and sampling of the 299 herds, proportionate sample was obtained using the formula: (sample size/population size) x stratum size (small, medium or large herd) [20] i.e. 298/1323 = 0.225 x stratum size. In the actual study the fractions for large, medium and small herds were 71% (n = 212), 16% (n = 49) and 13% (n = 38), respectively and those in the overall population were 89%, 7% and 4%. The over-representation of larger farms was due to a greater level of refusal to participate in smaller herds, despite efforts to address this, and numbers were made up in medium and large herds. A direct method of standardization (adjustment) [20] was employed to adjust for the effect of having a higher representation of larger farms in the crude overall bTB prevalence result.\nThe procedure of the SICCT test was adapted from OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2009 (Bovine Tuberculosis) and the supplier of Tuberculin PPD was Prionics, Lelystad, The Netherlands. The injection site used was at the border of the anterior and middle thirds of left side (for consistency) of the neck. Two sites were used, one for bovine PPD (lower site) and the other for avian PPD (upper site). The upper site was 10 cm below the crest and the lower site was 12.5 cm from the upper site, on a line drawn parallel with the line of the shoulder. The selected site of injection was shaved to an adequately sized area for identification of the injection sites and cleansed. Before injection, a fold of skin at each of the intended injection sites and within the clipped area was taken between the forefinger and thumb and measured to the nearest millimeter using the same digital caliper (0-150mm range) throughout the survey. Then 0.1 ml of Bovine Tuberculin PPD and 0.1ml of Avian Tuberculin PPD was injected intradermally in the lower and upper site, respectively. A correct injection was confirmed by palpating a small pea-like swelling at each injection site. The two injection sites were re-measured after 72 hours by the same person who measured the skin thickness before the injection. For the interpretation, the SICCT test was considered positive if the difference was more than 4 mm; inconclusive if between 1 to 4 mm; and negative if the increase in skin thickness at the bovine site of injection was less than 1 mm or equal to the increase in the skin reaction at the avian site of injection.\nFarm data were collected by trained research assistants through face to face interview with pre-tested structured questionnaire to capture animal and herd-level information. General information including herd structure, farm antecedents, farm management/husbandry, housing/ventilation, animal health (veterinary services) and animal bio-security were recorded. Specific information related to potential risk factors for bTB were recorded including animals age, sex, breed, physiology (pregnancy/stages of lactation/body condition), herd size, cattle sourcing (cattle movements in and out of the herd), bTB history on farm, contacts /interactions with neighboring herd/other domestic animals/wild animals etc. (S1 Questionnaire). Global Positioning System(GPS) data was collected for each herd for mapping bTB prevalence in the study areas (S1 Fig).\nData from questionnaires and the tuberculin skin test were curated and coded. All the statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical language [22] and RStudio [23]. Based on the SICCT test, the animal level and herd level bTB prevalence for Addis Ababa city and surrounding five study areas was described and 95% confidence interval calculated. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used for comparison of variability in within herd bTB prevalence (%) among studied dairy herds. Our dataset was hierarchal in nature i.e. individual animals were clustered within herds and herds were clustered within study areas. To account for this clustering and deal with variation in prevalence between study areas and in particular between herds, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) [24] was used which allowed us to treat herd and study areas as random effects with a binary response as an outcome variable (bTB reactor or not reactor). Animals with reading difference between 1\u20134 mm were treated as negatives. We used the glmer() function in the lme4 package [25]. The statistical unit of analysis was the individual animal. We performed a univariable screen to select variables for inclusion in the multivariable model. All variables with a p-value of < 0.20 and those with a high biological relevance were considered as candidate variables for the model building. These candidate explanatory variables were investigated further for collinearity requiring that all selected variables for the multivariable model have a variance inflation factor (VIF) of < 5 [11]. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level.\nFor binary data a binomial response (more specifically, the Bernoulli distribution) was used [26]. To specify the model, we define the binary response variable:\nAll screened predictors were initially included in the global model, including biologically plausible two-way interactions. Breed was considered as potential confounder for herd size. As some confounding is invariably present, and the important issue is how large the confounding effect is, not whether or not it is present [24]. We specified a difference of 20% change in the odds ratio as an indication of confounding [24]. The removal of breed from the final model changed the logit of herd size by 13.2% (7.7.-6.8)/6.8) for medium herds and by 19.2% (9.9\u20138.8)/8.3) for large herds, thus no strong confounding effect was found between the two factors.\nFor model fitting in addition to the global model, a set of models were proposed (S4 Table) to identify potential risk factors that most affect the outcome variable of interest i.e. bTB status. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for comparing and selecting between models. As described by Burnham and Anderson [27], the AIC approach is first to calculate an AIC value for each model proposed and to examine the differences between the AIC values of competing models to the model with minimum value of AIC (often termed as the best model). To put this mathematically: \u0394AIC = AICi\u2212minAIC; where AICi is the competing model and minAIC is the model with the minimum AIC value. We used this \u0394AIC value to rank and identify candidate models. A threshold was set for identifying candidate models; where models with \u0394AIC < 3 and Akaike weights (w > 0.05) [11] were set as candidate models. A model with highest Akaike weights value (often interpreted as the probability that model is the best model) was used for selecting the best model. In our data we identified that the interaction effect between herd and breed was biasing estimates of other variables (skewing the estimate for the herd size variable) due to the small number of zebu cattle in the medium herd level category. Dropping this interaction\u2013results in the global model having both the lowest AIC and highest Akaike weight and explained the data well and subsequently selected for reporting.\nThis study was approved by AHRI-ALERT Ethics Review Committee (Project Reg.No PO46/14) and Ethiopia\u2019s National Research Ethics Review Committee (NRERC No. 3.10/800/07). Informed consent was obtained verbally from dairy farm owners who were briefed in the presence of a witness (local experts) on the tuberculin skin testing procedure; no known risks to the animal associated with this; their participation in study is voluntary, and that confidentiality on test result will be maintained. When agreed, the witness and the participant\u2019s full addresses including their mobile phone numbers were recorded for filing and in case contact with participant was needed.\nThis study investigated 299 dairy herds (212 small, 49 medium, and 38 large farms) for bTB using the SICCT test in the urban and peri-urban areas of central Ethiopia. In addition, descriptive data on these herds were collected. With regard to ownership of the studied herds, 238 (82.9%) herds were owned privately, 31were cooperatives (10.8%), eight were government herds (2.8%) and ten were share companies (3.5%). Twelve herds had no records about ownership. The majority of herds (77.1%) had loose house type and practice zero grazing (roughage with supplement feeding) (78.5%). Artificial insemination (AI) was the main breeding strategy for 69% of these farmers, 83% vaccinated their cattle against major diseases, while 67% dewormed their cattle on a regular basis. The herd structure of the studied dairy herds is presented in Table 1 and additional herds characteristics is provided in S1 Table.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.t001\nIn total 5,675 cattle from 299 herds were tested by using the SICCT test. Overall there were1,776 reactors (31.3% crude animal prevalence- not adjusted for herd size; 95% CI: 30\u201333%) in 180 herds (60.9% crude herd prevalence; 95% CI:55.2\u201366.2%), with each positive herd having at least one reactor (Table 2). Sebeta had the highest prevalence (42% at animal level with 95% CI: 38\u201346% and 74%at herd level with 95% CI: 55\u201387%) among all six regions whereas Holeta had the lowest prevalence(17% at animal level with 95% CI: 14\u201320% and 27% at herd level with 95% CI: 13\u201346%). There was significant variation between study areas in prevalence of tuberculin reactors (\u03c72 = 143.18, df = 5, p-value <0.001). Using GPS data for individual farms, bTB prevalence maps were created for the six study areas, each visualizing the bTB burden for large, medium and small herds (S1 Fig).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.t002\nThe bTB prevalence was stratified on herd size based on the study population (Table 3A). The results showed a different prevalence between herd sizes with a significant increase in prevalence with herd size group. As the recruitment of herds into the study had been somewhat over-represented of larger herds as compared to the original sampling strategy, it was relevant to standardise the prevalence estimates in the study population. Therefore, Table 3B presents herd size specific prevalence of bTB for the standard population (a population we aimed to sample) of all study sites. The overall crude bTB prevalence was higher (31.3%: 95% CI: 30\u201333) compared with herd size adjusted prevalence (24.5%: 95% CI:23.3\u201325.8) (using direct method of standardization). The same trend was recorded for the herd level bTB prevalence (Table 3).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.t003\nThe average within-herd prevalence is heavily skewed by a relatively small proportion of extremely high prevalence herds (illustrated by Fig 2). Within-herd prevalence is multi-modal with the majority of small and medium herds having a prevalence less than the population average. The population mean 31.5% was higher compared to the median 10%, thus indicating a positive skewedness and that a higher proportion of herds (67.9%) had a within herd prevalence less than the population average. Although the average within-herd prevalence does not demonstrate a strong herd-size dependence, there is a marked difference in the distribution with a markedly higher proportion of herds having a prevalence greater than the population average. A greater proportion of large herds (65.8%) (median: 50%) were having within herd prevalence greater than the population average.\n(A) Within-herd bTB prevalence distribution for stratified herds (Visualizing multiple distributions simultaneously) (B) Within-herd bTB prevalence distribution for affected herds (bTB prevalence > 0).\n(A) Within-herd bTB prevalence distribution for stratified herds (Visualizing multiple distributions simultaneously) (B) Within-herd bTB prevalence distribution for affected herds (bTB prevalence > 0).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.g002\nTranslating this into numbers: the mean within herd prevalence for all herds was 31.5\u00b1 30.7% and a median of 10% (lower quartile0 and 42.5% upper quartile). Stratification on large, medium, and small herds, there was a mean within herd prevalence of 40.6%, 35.1%, and 18.8%, respectively, while the median value for the respective herd size was50%, 33%, and 8.3. In this study, there was a significant difference in within herd prevalence among studied dairy herds (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test: df = 2,\u03c72 = 33.295, p value < 0.001).\nSixteen potential risk factors, based on knowledge and understanding of the husbandry system and biological relevance were considered and screened by univariable analysis (Table 4). Twelve variables with p-value of < 0.20 and with OR > 1 were selected for multivariable analysis. Contact with other domestic animals, stages of lactation, viral disease outbreak, and regular de-worming did not fulfil the stated criteria and were excluded from analysis. A full description of the measured risk factors is provided in S2 Table. Total number of examined animals (3rd column in Table 4) used for analysis of respective risk factor may differ from the overall number of animals tested (N = 5,675) due to missing values.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.t004\nBased on their high OR, absence of collinearity and statistical significance (p-value <0.2), twelve variables (Table 4) were considered in the final multivariable model. The final model thus consisted of four variables: herd size, age, bTB history at farm, and breed as significant risk factors for bTB. Animals from large herds had 8.3 times the odds of being a bTB tuberculin reactor compared to animals living in small herds. There was also a strong effect of age, with animals 8\u201310 years of age having 8.9 times the odds of being reactors compared to the youngest category (Table 5).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.t005\nIn this study we set out to perform the largest bTB prevalence study so far in dairy farms in central Ethiopia (Fig 1) to get a comprehensive understanding of the scope of the burden of the disease and identify potential risk factors contributing to the transmission of bTB within the study area. Previous studies had limitations especially in methodology used. For example two studies in Addis Ababa did not show clearly how sample size was determined (no mention of formula and parameters used) and how different herd categories were proportionally sampled [10, 28]. In these studies there was over representation of farms with herd sizes of 20 and above (>25%) where the proportion of these farms in the overall population was estimated to below 10%. There were similar limitations in scope of study objectives, methodology used, target population and geographic coverage as reviewed by Sibhat et al. [12]. Our study therefore addressed the concerns of previous studies. With an overall crude animal prevalence of 31.3% (n = 1,776) (herd size adjusted: 24.5%) and a 60.9% (n = 180) crude prevalence at herd level (herd size adjusted: 54.4%), we recorded a high level of bTB prevalence. However, there was variation between the six study areas: relatively low prevalence was recorded in Holeta and this could be related to earlier work to control for bTB in selected infected government herds in that area, which at the time were supplying heifers to surrounding farmers [29]. In this survey we also noted significant variation of within-herd bTB prevalence (P-value < 0.05) among the studied dairy herds, which ranged from 0 to 100% and with a mean for all herds of 31.5% \u00b1 30.7 SD. This variability would mean differences in transmission due to husbandry and other risk factors discussed in this paper or as reviewed by Broughan et al. [30]. By herd stratification, large herds recorded the highest within-herd prevalence (mean: 40.6%) and a larger proportion (65.8%) had a within-herd prevalence greater than the population average. Such high herd prevalence could be due to an increased risk of within-herd transmission in farms with larger herd size [31]. This finding is relevant for control measures such as limited test and removal which could be economically viable in the lower prevalence herds.\nRisk factors influence transmission and can be categorised at regional, herd, and animal level [32] and vary across regions for several reasons, such as difference in farm management practices [33]. Analysis of this can be useful to develop a strategy for risk-based surveillance and control for bTB. The present study has identified several risk factors for bTB. Animals from large herds had 8.3 times the odds of being tuberculin reactor compared to those from small herds. Herd size is the most frequently reported risk factor for bTB in Ethiopia and elsewhere [5, 10, 11, 34, 35]. The risk of infection in a herd increases with herd size and this could be due to overcrowding which increases probability of contact between animals in larger herds implying that transmission may be density dependent [30]. High density creates favorable environment for bTB as aerosol is one main route of transmission. The postmortem data collected by Firdessa and colleagues [5] support this as most animals had TB lesions in lungs and/or lung associated lymph nodes. Also, larger herds often have a larger grazing area, which may expose them to greater environmental risk factors (e.g. wildlife reservoir though not confirmed in Ethiopia) and may also expose them to more neighboring herds [35]. Although the number of large herds in Ethiopia are few (even in the central part of the country) their impact on bTB transmission is likely to be significant as many of them are highly infected and they are primary suppliers of heifers to smallholder farms as well as of milk to consumers and could therefore be most potential sources of infection. If a future bTB control program in Ethiopia would focus on these farms, such intervention could possibly be financially affordable given their small number and turning them into bTB free herds could potentially have a significant impact on the overall bTB prevalence in the Ethiopian dairy sector.\nWhen looking for other potential risk factors, there was also a strong effect of age. Animals between 8\u201310 years old were having the highest odds of being bTB reactors (OR: 8.9, 95% CI: 5\u201315.6) compared to the baseline category, which was the youngest age group. A linear increase between bTB infection and age was reviewed by Broughan et al. [30] and observed in slaughterhouse surveillances in cattle in Northern Ireland and Great Britain [26, 36]. The mean age of reactor cattle was 4.4 years (95% CI: 4.29\u20134.56). Longevity increases probability of exposure and it also increases the chance for development of visible TB lesions and detection in slaughterhouse surveillances. In addition, purchase of older cattle\u2014particularly from high risk areas\u2014could increase the risk of introducing bTB in a herd. Instead, the adoption of risk-based trading has the potential to reduce the risk of bTB spread [37].\nWe found also that animals from herds with history of bTB had 5.2 times odds of disease detection compared to herds with no history of bTB. In a tuberculin positive herd which did not remove reactors after skin testing, there could be an increase in infection and hence reactor animals. Even in herds which did cull the reactors, there could be recurrent incidents attributable to persistence of infection in such herds due to failure to detect and remove all infected cattle associated with the performance of the skin test [30].\nExotic and cross bred cattle are known to be more susceptible to bTB [8, 30]. Here we found 2.5 times (95% CI: 1.5\u20135.8) odds of being bTB reactor in these breeds compared to the indigenous zebu breed. The strategy to meet high milk demand is still geared towards improved dairy cattle as a crossbred dairy cow produces on average at least five times more milk than an indigenous zebu cow [38]. With the Ethiopian Government setting a policy to significantly increase the number of crossbred cattle, intensification is likely to increase and thereby the risk of bTB transmission [12, 15]. The final important risk factor we identified is the introduction of cattle to the herd through purchase. We found that cattle purchased from another farm were more often reactors (37.5%) compared to cattle bred at own farm (30%). Although this difference is not statistically significant, it warrants further investigation.\nOverall, when comparing our study with previous surveys of dairy cattle in this established dairy belt of Ethiopia, there was no major difference in bTB animal prevalence but our study showed a slight increase in herd prevalence. Firdessa and colleagues [5] recorded in 2009/2010 a 30% (n = 2,956) animal and 50% (n = 88) herd level bTB prevalence while Tsegaye and colleagues [10] in 2006/2007 recorded 34.1% (n = 1,132) animal and 53.6% (n = 56) herd bTB prevalence, respectively, which is comparable to our corresponding figures. This consistency over time suggests that bTB has reached an endemic equilibrium in these herds. The burden of bTB in the dairy belt in central Ethiopia (31%) is much greater than for emerging dairies in regional states, estimated to range from 0.3% to 12% animal prevalence [6, 11, 13, 34]. At present Ethiopia has no bTB control program but if implemented should consider the central region of the country as a bTB high risk area and this report opens up for a scientific approach for future risk-based surveillance and disease intervention. Cattle trading from this region pose high risk of introducing bTB infection to new herds and underlines the significance of cattle trade regulation with pre-movement testing. The significantly lower bTB prevalence recorded in many emerging dairies in the regional states (which could be considered as low risk regions) presents an opportunity for intervention e.g. by trade restrictions to prevent further disease transmission from high risk areas like central Ethiopia and introduce testing to support farmers to keep their herds free from bTB. A recent survey by Mekonnen and colleagues [6] recorded an average disease rate of 5.2% (95% CI: 4\u20136%) in three emerging dairies in regional states, including Hawassa (3%), Gondar (1.4%), and Mekelle (12%). An earlier report from 2014 [39] documented also lower prevalence (below 7%) in eight out of twelve emerging dairies, but ranging from 0.8% to 24% with a few hot spots in Kombolcha (24%) and Mekelle (14%), the latter confirmed by Mekonnen et al. [6]. The lower bTB rates in many of these emerging dairy regions could be due to less cattle movement from high risk regions and less intensification, as they may have emerged more recently. However, if these emerging dairy regions will intensify, and without a strategy for bTB disease control in Ethiopia, it is likely that these regions will be more affected by bTB in the future.\nAs the Ethiopian dairy sector is expanding, especially through emerging new dairies around many other urban centers across the country, the findings from this study add useful epidemiological information critical for the application of targeted evidence-based control measures. Therefore, there is now an opportunity to take steps towards a strategy that can control or significantly reduce the burden of bTB in Ethiopia to improve animal and human health.\nAs a limitation of this study; in some of the herds, which lacked records-for some risk factors such as age, data was collected through interview. As people may not always recall correct information especially for older animals we tried to compliment such age estimation with parity and dentition data.\nThe present study reported a high level of bTB prevalence in the large dairy belt around the capital Addis Ababa in central Ethiopia based on the SICCT test. High variability in burden of infection among the tested dairy herds was also an important finding of this study as it can have impact on future disease intervention strategies. In addition, it identified herd size, animal age, cattle breed, and bTB history at farm as important risk factors contributing to the high prevalence of bTB in the central parts of the country.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s002\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s003\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s004\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s006\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254091.s007\nWe thank NAHDIC for their logistical support.

                    "value": "It would be quite difficult \u2013 some might say impossible \u2013 to design broadly adopted ethical AI systems. A share of the experts responding noted that ethics are hard to define, implement and enforce. They said context matters when it comes to ethical considerations. Any attempt to fashion ethical rules generates countless varying scenarios in which applications of those rules can be messy. The nature and relative power of the actors in any given scenario also matter. Social standards and norms evolve and can become wholly different as cultures change. Few people have much education or training in ethics. Additionally, good and bad actors exploit loopholes and gray areas where ethical rules aren\u2019t crisp, so workarounds, patches or other remedies are often created with varying levels of success.\nThe experts who expressed worries also invoked governance concerns. They asked: Whose ethical systems should be applied? Who gets to make that decision? Who has responsibility to care about implementing ethical AI? Who might enforce ethical regimes once they are established? How?\nA large number of respondents argued that geopolitical and economic competition are the main drivers for AI developers, while moral concerns take a back seat. A share of these experts said creators of AI tools work in groups that have little or no incentive to design systems that address ethical concerns.\nSome respondents noted that, even if workable ethics requirements might be established, they could not be applied or governed because most AI design is proprietary, hidden and complex. How can harmful AI \u201coutcomes\u201d be diagnosed and addressed if the basis for AI \u201cdecisions\u201d cannot be discerned? Some of these experts also note that existing AI systems and databases are often used to build new AI applications. That means the biases and ethically troubling aspects of current systems are being designed into the new systems. They say diagnosing and unwinding the pre-existing problems may be difficult if not impossible to achieve.\nA selection of respondents\u2019 comments on this broad topic is organized over the next 20 pages under these subheadings: 1) It can be hard to agree as to what constitutes ethical behavior. 2) Humans are the problem: Whose ethics? Who decides? Who cares? Who enforces? 3) Like all tools, AI can be used for good or ill, which makes standards-setting a challenge. 4) Further AI evolution itself raises questions and complications.\nStephen Downes, senior research officer for digital technologies with the National Research Council of Canada, observed, \u201cThe problem with the application of ethical principles to artificial intelligence is that there is no common agreement about what those are. While it is common to assume there is some sort of unanimity about ethical principles, this unanimity is rarely broader than a single culture, profession or social group. This is made manifest by the ease with which we perpetuate unfairness, injustice and even violence and death to other people. No nation is immune.\n\u201cThe problem with the application of ethical principles to artificial intelligence is that there is no common agreement about what those are. While it is common to assume there is some sort of unanimity about ethical principles, this unanimity is rarely broader than a single culture, profession or social group.\u201d\n\u201cCompounding this is the fact that contemporary artificial intelligence is not based on principles or rules. Modern AI is based on applying mathematical functions on large collections of data. This type of processing is not easily shaped by ethical principles; there aren\u2019t \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018evil\u2019 mathematical functions, and the biases and prejudices in the data are not easily identified nor prevented. Meanwhile, the application of AI is underdetermined by the outcome; the same prediction, for example, can be used to provide social support and assistance to a needy person or to prevent that person from obtaining employment, insurance or financial services.\n\u201cUltimately, our AI will be an extension of ourselves, and the ethics of our AI will be an extension of our own ethics. To the extent that we can build a more ethical society, whatever that means, we will build more ethical AI, even if only by providing our AI with the models and examples it needs in order to be able to distinguish right from wrong. I am hopeful that the magnification of the ethical consequences of our actions may lead us to be more mindful of them; I am fearful that they may not.\u201d\nKenneth A. Grady, adjunct professor at Michigan State University College of Law and editor of The Algorithmic Society on Medium, said, \u201cGetting those creating AI to use it in an \u2018ethical\u2019 way faces many hurdles that society is unlikely to overcome in the foreseeable future. In some key ways, regulating AI ethics is akin to regulating ethics in society at large. AI is a distributed and relatively inexpensive technology. I can create and use AI in my company, my research lab or my home with minimal resources. That AI may be quite powerful. I can unleash it on the world at no cost.\n\u201cAssuming that we could effectively regulate it, we face another major hurdle: What do we mean by \u2018ethical?\u2019 Putting aside philosophical debates, we face practical problems in defining ethical AI. We do not have to look far to see similar challenges. During the past few years, what is or is not ethical behavior in U.S. politics has been up for debate. Other countries have faced similar problems.\n\u201cEven if we could decide on a definition [for ethics] in the U.S., it would likely vary from the definitions used in other countries. Given AI\u2019s ability to fluidly cross borders, regulating AI would prove troublesome. We also will find that ethical constraints may be at odds with other self-interests. Situational ethics could easily arise when we face military or intelligence threats, economic competitive threats, and even political threats.\n\u201cFurther, AI itself presents some challenges. Today, much of what happens in some AI systems is not known to the creators of the systems. This is the black-box problem. Regulating what happens in the black box may be difficult. Alternatively, banning black boxes may hinder AI development, putting our economic, military or political interests at risk.\u201d\nRyan Sweeney, director of analytics for Ignite Social Media, commented, \u201cThe definition of \u2018public good\u2019 is important here. How much does intent versus execution matter? Take Facebook, for instance. They might argue that their AI content review platform is in the interest of \u2018public good,\u2019 but it continues to fail. AI is only as ethical and wise as those who program it. One person\u2019s racism is another\u2019s free speech. What might be an offensive word to someone might not even be in the programmer\u2019s lexicon.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure AI will be used with ethical intent, but ethics require empathy. In order to program ethics, there has to be a definitive right and wrong, but situations likely aren\u2019t that simple and require some form of emotional and contextual human analysis. The success of ethical AI execution comes down to whether or not the programmers literally thought of every possible scenario. In other words, AI will likely be developed and used with ethical intent, but it will likely fall short of what we, as humans, can do. We should use AI as a tool to help guide our decisions, but not rely on it entirely to make those decisions. Otherwise, the opportunity for abuse or unintended consequences will show its face. I\u2019m also sure that AI will be used with questionable intent, as technology is neither inherently good nor bad. Since technology is neutral, I\u2019m sure we will see cases of AI abused for selfish gains or other questionable means and privacy violations. Ethical standards are complicated to design and hard to program.\u201d\nBelow is a sampling of expert answers that speak to the broad concerns that ethical behaviors can be hard to define and even more difficult to build into AI systems.\nMark Lemley, director of Stanford University\u2019s Program in Law, Science and Technology, observed, \u201cPeople will use AI for both good and bad purposes. Most companies will try to design the technology to make good decisions, but many of those decisions are hard moral choices with no great answer. AI offers the most promise in replacing very poor human judgment in things like facial recognition and police stops.\u201d\nMarc Brenman, managing member at IDARE, a transformational training and leadership development consultancy based in Washington, D.C., wrote, \u201cAs societies, we are very weak on morality and ethics generally. There is no particular reason to think that our machines or systems will do better than we do. Faulty people create faulty systems. In general, engineers and IT people and developers have no idea what ethics are. How could they possibly program systems to have what they do not? As systems learn and develop themselves, they will look around at society and repeat its errors, biases, stereotypes and prejudices. We already see this in facial recognition.\n\u201cAI will make certain transactions faster, such as predicting what I will buy online. AI systems may get out of control as they become autonomous. Of what use are humans to them? They may permit mistakes to be made very fast, but the systems may not recognize the consequences of their actions as \u2018mistakes.\u2019 For example, if they maximize efficiency, then the Chinese example of social control may dominate.\n\u201cWhen AI systems are paired with punishment or kinetic feedback systems, they will be able to control our behavior. Imagine a pandemic where a \u2018recommendation\u2019 is made to shelter in place or wear a mask or stay six feet away from other people. If people are hooked up to AI systems, the system may give an electrical shock to a person who does not implement the recommendation. This will be like all of us wearing shock collars that some of us use on our misbehaving dogs.\u201d\nJune Anne English-Lueck, professor of anthropology at San Jose State University and a distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future, said, \u201cAI systems employ algorithms that are only as sound as the premises on which they are built and the accuracy of the data with which they learn. Human ethical systems are complex and contradictory. Such nuances as good for whom and bad for whom are difficult to parse. Smart cities, drawing on systems of surveillance and automated government need mechanisms of human oversight. Oversight has not been our strong suit in the last few decades, and there is little reason to believe it will be instituted in human-automation interactions.\u201d\nAmali De Silva-Mitchell, a futurist and consultant participating in multistakeholder, global internet governance processes, wrote, \u201cAlthough there are lots of discussions, there are few standards or those that exist are at a high level or came too late for the hundreds of AI applications already rolled out. These base AI applications will not be reinvented, so there is embedded risk. However, the more discussion there is, the greater the understanding of the existing ethical issues, and that can be seen to be developing, especially as societal norms and expectations change. AI applications have the potential to be beneficial, but the applications have to be managed so as not to cause unintended harms. For global delivery and integrated service, there needs to be common standards, transparency and collaboration. Duplication of efforts is a waste of resources.\u201d\nGlenn Edens, professor at Thunderbird School of Global Management, Arizona State University, previously a vice president at PARC, observed, \u201cThe promise: AI and ML could create a world that is more efficient, wasting less energy or resources providing health care, education, entertainment, food and shelter to more people at lower costs. Being legally blind, I look forward to the day of safe and widely available self-driving cars, for example. Just like the steam engine, electricity, bicycles and personal computers (especially laptops) amplify human capacity AI, and ML hopefully will do the same.\n\u201cThe concerns: AI and its cousin ML are still in their infancy \u2013 and while the technology progress is somewhat predictable, the actual human consequences are murky. The promise is great \u2013 so was our naive imagination of what the internet would do for humankind. Commercial interests (and thus their deployment of AI and ML) are far more agile and adaptable than either the humans they supposedly serve or the governance systems. Regulation is largely reactionary, rarely proactive \u2013 typically, bad things have to happen before frameworks to guide responsible and equitable behavior are written into laws, standards emerge or usage is codified into acceptable norms. It is great that the conversation has started; however, there is a lot of ongoing development in the boring world of enterprise software development that is largely invisible.\n\u201cCredit scoring comes to mind as a major potential area of concern \u2013 while the credit-scoring firms always position their work as providing consumers more access to financial products, the reality is that we\u2019ve created a system that unfairly penalizes the poor and dramatically limits fair access to financial products at equitable prices. AI and ML will be used by corporations to evaluate everything they do and every transaction, rate every customer and their potential (value), predict demand, pricing, targeting as well as their own employees and partners \u2013 while this can lead to efficiency, productivity and creation of economic value, a lot of it will lead to segmenting, segregation, discrimination, profiling and inequity. Imagine a world where pricing is different for everyone from one moment to the next, and these predictive systems can transfer huge sums of value in an instant, especially from the most vulnerable.\u201d\nA strategy and planning expert responded, \u201cWhile I say and believe that, yes, ethical boundaries will be put in place for AI by 2030, I also realize that doing this is going to be incredibly difficult. The understanding of what an AI is doing as it builds and adapts its understandings and approaches rather quickly gets to a point where human knowing and keeping up gets left behind. The how and why something was done or recommended can be unknowable. Also, life and the understanding of right and wrong or good-ish and bad-ish can be fluid for people, as things swing to accommodate the impacts on the human existence and condition as well as livable life on our planet. Setting bounds and limitations has strong value, but being able to understand when things are shifting out of areas that are comfortable or have introduced a new realization for a need to correct for unintended consequences is needed. But bounds around bias need to be considered and worked through before setting ethical limitations in place.\u201d\nA vice president at a major global company wrote, \u201cAI is too distributed a technology to be effectively governed. It is too easily accessible to any individual, company or organization with reasonably modest resources. That means that unlike, say, nuclear or bioweapons, it will be almost impossible to govern, and there always will be someone willing to develop the technology without regard to ethical consequences.\u201d\nWendy M. Grossman, a UK-based science writer, author of \u201cnet.wars\u201d and founder of the magazine The Skeptic, predicted, \u201cThe distribution of this will be uneven. I\u2019ve just read Jane Mayer\u2019s piece in The New Yorker on poultry-packing plants, and it provides a great example of why it\u2019s not enough to have laws and ethics; you must enforce them and give the people you\u2019re trying to protect sufficient autonomy to participate in enforcing them. I think ethical/unethical AI will be unevenly distributed. It will all depend on what the society into which the technology is being injected will accept and who is speaking. At the moment, we have two divergent examples:\nBut then what we have today isn\u2019t AI as originally imagined by the Dartmouth group. We are still a very long way from any sort of artificial general intelligence with any kind of independent autonomy. The systems we have depend for their ethics on two things: access to the data necessary to build them and the ethics of the owner. It isn\u2019t AI that needs ethics, it\u2019s the owners.\u201d\nGlynn Rogers, retired, previously senior principal engineer and a founding member at the CSIRO Centre for Complex Systems Science, said, \u201cAI and its successors are potentially so powerful that we have no choice but to ensure attention to ethics. The alternative would be to hand over control of our way of life to a class of developers and implementors that are either focused on short-term and shortsighted interests or who have some form of political agenda particularly \u2018state actors.\u2019 The big question is how to ensure this. A regulatory framework is part of the answer, but I suspect that a major requirement is to change the culture of the AI industry. Rather than developing technologies simply for the sake of it, or to publish clever papers, there needs to be a cultural environment in which developers see as an inherent part of their task to consider the potential social and economic impacts of their activities and an employment framework that does not seek to repress this. Perhaps moral and political philosophy should be part of the education of AI developers.\u201d\nAlexandra Samuel, technology writer, researcher, speaker and regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal and Harvard Business Review, wrote, \u201cWithout serious, enforceable international agreements on the appropriate use and principles for AI, we face an almost inevitable race to the bottom. The business value of AI has no intrinsic dependence on ethical principles; if you can make more money with AIs that prioritize the user over other people, or that prioritize business needs over end users, then companies will build AIs that maximize profits over people. The only possible way of preventing that trajectory is with national policies that mandate or proscribe basic AI principles, and those kinds of national policies are only possible with international cooperation; otherwise, governments will be too worried about putting their own countries\u2019 businesses at a disadvantage.\u201d\nValerie Bock, VCB Consulting, former Technical Services Lead at Q2 Learning, commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve developed the philosophical sophistication in the humans who design AI sufficiently to expect them to be able to build ethical sophistication into their software. Again and again, we are faced with the ways our own unconscious biases pop up in our creations. It is turning out that we do not understand ourselves or our motivations as well as we would like to imagine we might. Work in AI helps lay some of this out for us, aiding us in a quest [that] humanity has pursued for millennia. A little humility based on what we are learning is in order.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve developed the philosophical sophistication in the humans who design AI sufficiently to expect them to be able to build ethical sophistication into their software.\u201d\nThe director of a military center for strategy and technology said, \u201cMost AI will attempt to embed ethical concerns at some level. It is not clear how \u2018unbiased\u2019 AI can be created. Perfectly unbiased training datasets don\u2019t exist, and, due to human biases being an inherent part of interactions, such a goal may be unobtainable. As such, we may see gender or racial biases in some training datasets, which will spill over into operational AI systems, in spite of our efforts to combat this.\u201d\nAlan S. Inouye, director of the Office for Information Technology Policy at the American Library Association, responded, \u201cI don\u2019t see people or organizations setting out in a nefarious path in their use of AI. But of course, they will use it to advance their missions and goals and, in some sense, employ \u2018local\u2019 ethics. But ethics is neither standardized nor additive across domains. What is ethics across AI systems? It is like asking, \u2018What is cybersecurity across society?\u2019\u201d\nMaggie Jackson, former Boston Globe columnist and author of \u201cDistracted: Reclaiming Our Focus in a World of Lost Attention,\u201d wrote, \u201cI am deeply concerned by how little we understand of what AI algorithms know or how they know it. This black-box effect is real and leads to unintended impact. Most importantly, in the absence of true understanding, assumptions are held up as the foundation of current and future goals. There should be far greater attention paid to the hidden and implicit value systems that are inherent in the design and development of AI in all forms. An example: robot caregivers, assistants and tutors are being increasingly used in caring for the most vulnerable members of society despite known misgivings by both scientist\u2013roboticists, ethicists and users, potential and current. It\u2019s highly alarming that the robots\u2019 morally dubious fa\u00e7ade of care is increasingly seen as a good-enough substitute for the blemished yet reciprocal care carried out by humans.\n\u201cNew ethical AI guidelines that emphasize transparency are a good first step in trying to ensure that care recipients and others understand who/what they are dealing with. But profit-driven systems, the hubris of inventors, humans\u2019 innate tendency to try to relate to any objects that seem to have agency, and other forces combine to work against the human skepticism that is needed if we are to create assistive robots that preserve the freedom and dignity of the humans who receive their care.\u201d\nAlan D. Mutter, a consultant and former Silicon Valley CEO, said, \u201cAI is only as smart and positive as the people who train it. We need to spend as much time on the moral and ethical implementation of AI as we do on hardware, software and business models. Last time I checked, there was no code of ethics in Silicon Valley. We need a better moral barometer than the NASDAQ index.\u201d\nFred Baker, board member of the Internet Systems Consortium and longtime IETF leader, commented, \u201cI would like to see AI be far more ethical than it is. That said, human nature hasn\u2019t changed, and the purposes to which AI is applied have not fundamentally changed. We may talk about it more, but I don\u2019t think AI ethics will ultimately change.\u201d\nRandall Mayes, a technology analyst at TechCast Global, observed, \u201cThe standardization of AI ethics concerns me because the American, European and Chinese governments and Silicon Valley companies have different ideas about what is ethical. How AI is used will depend on your government\u2019s hierarchy of values among economic development, international competitiveness and social impacts.\u201d\nJim Witte, director of the Center for Social Science Research at George Mason University, responded, \u201cThe question assumes that ethics and morals are static systems. With developments in AI, there may also be an evolution of these systems such that what is moral and ethical tomorrow may be very different from what we see as moral and ethical today.\u201d\nYves Mathieu, co-director at Missions Publiques, based in Paris, France, wrote, \u201cEthical AI will require legislation like the European [GDPR] legislation to protect privacy rights on the internet. Some governments will take measures but not all will, as is the case today in regard to the production, marketing and usage of guns. There might be an initiative by some corporations, but there will be a need for engagement of the global chain of production of AI, which will be a challenge if some of the production is coming from countries not committed in the same ethical principles. Strong economic sanctions on nonethical AI production and use may be effective.\u201d\nAmy Sample Ward, CEO of NTEN: The Nonprofit Technology Network, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no question whether AI will be used in questionable ways. Humans do not share a consistent and collective commitment to ethical standards of any technology, especially not with artificial intelligence. Creating standards is not difficult, but accountability to them is very difficult, especially as government, military and commercial interests regularly find ways around systems of accountability. What systems will be adopted on a large scale to enforce ethical standards and protections for users? How will users have power over their data? How will user education be invested in for all products and services? These questions should guide us in our decision-making today so that we have more hope of AI being used to improve or benefit lives in the years to come.\u201d\nDan McGarry, an independent journalist based in Vanuatu, noted, \u201cJust like every other algorithm ever deployed, AI will be a manifestation of human bias and the perspective of its creator. Facebook\u2019s facial-recognition algorithm performs abysmally when asked to identify Black faces. AIs programmed in the affluent West will share its strengths and weaknesses. Likewise, AIs developed elsewhere will share the assumptions and the environment of their creators. They will not be images of them; they will be products of them and recognisable as such.\u201d\nAbigail De Kosnik, associate professor and director of the Center for New Media at the University of California-Berkeley, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see nearly enough understanding in the general public, tech workers or in STEM students about the possible dangers of AI \u2013 the ways that AI can harm and fail society. I am part of a wave of educators trying to introduce more ethics training and courses into our instruction, and I am hopeful that will shift the tide, but I am not optimistic about our chances. AI that is geared toward generating revenue for corporations will nearly always work against the interests of society.\u201d\nIrina Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics program at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, observed, \u201cThe conversation around AI ethics has been going on for several years now. However, what seems to be obvious among those who have been a part of it for some time has not trickled down into the curricula of many universities who are training the next generation of AI experts. Given that, it looks like it will take more than 10 years for \u2018most of the AI systems being used by organizations of all sorts to employ ethical principles focused primarily on the public good.\u2019 Also, many organizations are simply focused primarily on other goals \u2013 not on protecting or promoting the public good.\u201d\nA lawyer and former law school dean who specializes in technology issues wrote, \u201cAI is an exciting new space, but it is unregulated and, at least in early stages, will evolve as investment and monetary considerations direct. It is sufficiently known that there are no acknowledged ethical standards and probably won\u2019t be until beyond the time horizon you mention (2030). During that time, there will be an accumulation of \u2018worst-case scenarios,\u2019 major scandals on its use, a growth in pernicious use that will offend common sense and community moral and ethical standards. Those occasions and situations will lead to a gradual and increasing demand for regulation, oversight and ethical policies on use and misuse. But by whom (or what)? Who gets to impose those ethical prescriptions \u2013 the industries themselves? The government?\u201d\nThe director of a public policy center responded, \u201cI see a positive future for AI in the areas of health and education. However, there are ethical challenges here, too. Will the corporation who access and hold this data use it responsibly? What will be the role of government? Perhaps AI can help the developing water deal with climate change and water resources, but again, I see a real risk in the areas of equitable distribution, justice and privacy protections.\u201d\nA number of the experts who have concerns about the future of ethical AI raised issues around the fundamental nature of people. Flawed humans necessarily will be in the thick of these issues. Moreover, some experts argued that humans will have to create the governance systems overseeing the application of AI and judging how applications are affecting societies. These experts also asserted that there will always be fundamentally unethical people and organizations that will not adopt such principles. Further, some experts mentioned the fact that in a globally networked age even lone wolves can cause massive problems.\nLeslie Daigle, a longtime leader in the organizations building the internet and making it secure, noted, \u201cMy biggest concern with respect to AI and its ethical use has nothing to do with AI as a technology and everything to do with people. Nothing about the 21st century convinces me that we, as a society, understand that we are interdependent and need to think of something beyond our own immediate interests. Do we even have a common view of what is ethical?\n\u201cTaking one step back from the brink of despair, the things I\u2019d like to see AI successfully applied to, by 2030, include things like medical diagnoses (reading x-rays, etc.). Advances there could be monumental. I still don\u2019t want my fridge to order my groceries by 2030, but maybe that just makes me old? :-)\u201d\nTracey P. Lauriault, a professor expert in critical media studies and big data based at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, commented, \u201cAutomation, AI and machine learning (ML) used in traffic management as in changing the lights to improve the flow of traffic, or to search protein databases in big biochemistry analytics, or to help me sort out ideas on what show to watch next or books to read next, or to do land-classification of satellite images, or even to achieve organic and fair precision agriculture, or to detect seismic activity, the melting of polar ice caps, or to predict ocean issues are not that problematic (and its use, goodness forbid, to detect white-collar crime in a fintech context is not a problem).\n\u201cIf, however, the question is about social welfare intake systems, biometric sorting, predictive policing and border control, etc., then we are getting into quite a different scenario. How will these be governed, scrutinized, and who will be accountable for decisions and will those decisions about the procurement and use of these technologies or the intelligence derived from them?\n\u201cThey will reflect our current forms of governance, and these seem rather biased and unequal. If we can create a more just society then we may be able to have more-just AI/ML.\u201d\nLeiska Evanson, futurist and consultant, wrote, \u201cHumanity has biases. Humans are building the algorithms around the machine learning masquerading as AI. The \u2018AI\u2019 will have biases. It is impossible to have ethical AI (really, ML) if the \u2018parent\u2019 is biased. Companies such as banks are eager to use ML to justify not lending to certain minorities who simply do not create profit for them. Governments want to attend to the needs of the many before the few. The current concepts of AI are all about feeding more data to an electromechanical bureaucrat to rubberstamp, with no oversight from humans with competing biases.\u201d\nA director of standards and strategy at a major technology company commented, \u201cI believe that people are mostly good and that the intention will be to create ethical AI. However, an issue that I have become aware of is the fact that we all have intrinsic biases, unintentional biases, that can be exposed in subtle and yet significant ways. Consider that AI systems are built by people, and so they inherently work according to how the people that built them work. Thus, these intrinsic, unintentional biases are present in these systems. Even learning systems will \u2018learn\u2019 in a biased way. So, the interesting research question is whether or not we learn in a way that overcomes our intrinsic biases.\u201d\nJean Seaton, director of the Orwell Foundation and professor of media history at the University of Westminster, responded, \u201cThe ethics question also begs the questions of who would create and police such standards internationally? We need some visionary leaders and some powerful movements. The last big \u2018ethical\u2019 leap came after World War II. The Holocaust and World War II produced a set of institutions that in time led to the notion of human rights. That collective ethical step change (of course compromised but nevertheless immensely significant) was embodied in institutions with some collective authority. So that is what has to happen over AI. People have to be terrified enough, leaders have to be wise enough, people have to be cooperative enough, tech people have to be forward thinking enough, responsibility has to be felt vividly, personally, overwhelmingly enough \u2013 to get a set of rules passed and policed.\u201d\nCliff Lynch, director at the Coalition for Networked Information, wrote, \u201cEfforts will be made to create mostly \u2018ethical\u2019 AI applications by the end of the decade, but please understand that an ethical AI application is really just software that\u2019s embedded in an organization that\u2019s doing something; it\u2019s the organization rather than the software that bears the burden to be ethical. There will be some obvious exceptions for research, some kinds of national security, military and intelligence applications, market trading and economic prediction systems \u2013 many of these things operate under various sorts of \u2018alternative ethical norms\u2019 such as the \u2018laws of war\u2019 or the laws of the marketplace. And many efforts to unleash AI (really machine-learning) on areas like physics or protein-folding will fall outside all of the discussion of \u2018ethical AI.\u2019\n\u201cWe should resist the temptation to anthropomorphize these systems. (As the old saying goes, \u2018machines hate that.\u2019) Don\u2019t attribute agency and free will to software. \u2026The problems here are people and organizations, not code! \u2026 A lot of the discussion of ethical AI is really misguided. It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a huge problem with machine learning and pattern-recognition systems, for example, that are trained on inappropriate, incomplete or biased data (or data that reflect historical social biases) or where the domain of applicability and confidence of the classifiers or predictors aren\u2019t well-demarcated and understood. There\u2019s another huge problem where organizations are relying on (often failure-prone and unreliable, or trained on biased data, or otherwise problematic) pattern recognition or prediction algorithms (again machine-learning-based, usually) and devolving too much decision-making to these. Some of the recent facial-recognition disasters are good examples here. There are horrible organizational and societal practices that appeal to computer-generated decisions that are correct, unbiased, impartial or transparent and that place unjustified faith and authority in this kind of technology. But framing this in terms of AI ethics rather than bad human decision-making, stupidity, ignorance, wishful thinking, organizational failures and attempts to avoid responsibility seems wrong to me. We should be talking instead about the human and organizational ethics of using machine-learning and prediction systems for various purposes, perhaps.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see various players employ machine learning, pattern recognition and prediction in some really evil ways over the coming decade. Coupling this to social media or other cultural motivation and reward mechanisms is particularly scary. An early example here might be China\u2019s development of its \u2018social capital\u2019 rewards and tracking system. I\u2019m also frightened of targeted propaganda/advertising/persuasion systems. I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll also see organizations and governments in at least a few cases choose not to use these systems or to try to use them very cautiously and wisely and not delegate too much decision-making to them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to make good choices here, and I think some will. Genuine AI ethics seems to be part of the thinking about general-purpose AI, and I think we are a very, very, long way from this, though I\u2019ve seen some predictions to the contrary from people perhaps better informed than I am. The (rather more theoretical and speculative) philosophical and research discussions about superintelligence and about how one might design and develop such a general-purpose AI that won\u2019t rapidly decide to exterminate humanity are extremely useful, important and valid, but they have little to do with the rhetorical social justice critiques that confuse algorithms with the organizations that stupidly and inappropriately design, train and enshrine and apply them in today\u2019s world.\u201d\nDeirdre Williams, an independent researcher expert in global technology policy, commented, \u201cI can\u2019t be optimistic. We, the \u2018average persons,\u2019 have been schooled in preceding years toward\u00a0 selfishness, individualism, materialism and the ultimate importance of convenience. These values create the \u2018ethos.\u2019 At the very root of AI are databases, and these databases are constructed by human beings who decide which data are to be collected and how that data should be described and categorised. A tiny human error or bias at the very beginning can balloon into an enormous error of truth and/or justice.\u201d\nAlexa Raad, co-founder and co-host of the TechSequences podcast and former chief operating officer at Farsight Security, said, \u201cThere is hope for AI in terms of applications in health care that will make a positive difference. But legal/policy and regulatory frameworks almost always lag behind technical innovations. In order to guard against the negative repercussions of AI, we need a policy governance and risk-mitigation framework that is universally adopted. There needs to be an environment of global collaboration for a greater good. Although globalization led to many of the advances we have today (for example, the internet\u2019s design and architecture as well as its multistakeholder governance model), globalization is under attack. What we see across the world is a trend toward isolationism, separatism as evidenced by political movements such as populism, nationalism and outcomes such as Brexit. In order to come up with and adopt a comprehensive set of guidelines or framework for the use of AI or risk mitigation for abuse of AI, we would need a global current that supports collaboration. I hope I am wrong, but trends like this need longer than 10 years to run their course and for the pendulum to swing back the other way. By then, I am afraid some of the downsides and risks of AI will already be in play.\u201d\nAndrea Romaoli Garcia, an international lawyer actively involved with multistakeholder activities of the International Telecommunication Union and Internet Society, said, \u201cI define ethics as all possible and available choices where the conscience establishes the best option. Values and principles are the limiters that guide the conscience into this choice alongside the purposes; thus, ethics is a process. In terms of ethics for AI, the process for discovering what is good and right means choosing among all possible and available applications to find the one that best applies to the human-centred purposes, respecting all the principles and values that make human life possible.\n\u201cThe human-centred approach in ethics was first described by the Greek philosopher Socrates in his effort to turn attention from the outside world to the human condition. AI is a cognitive technology that allows greater advances in health, economic, political and social fields. It is impossible to deny how algorithms impact human evolution. Thus, an ethical AI requires that all instruments and applications place humans at the center. Despite the fact that there are some countries building ethical principles for AI, there is a lack of any sort of international instrument that covers all of the fields that guide the development and application of AI in a human-centred approach. AI isn\u2019t model-driven; it has a data-centred approach for highly scalable neural networks. Thus, the data should be selected and classified through human action. Through this human action, sociocultural factors are imprinted on the behavior of the algorithm and machine learning. This justifies the concerns about ethics and also focuses on issues such as freedom of expression, privacy and surveillance, ownership of data and discrimination, manipulation of information and trust, environmental and global warming and also on how the power will be established among society.\n\u201cThese are factors that determine human understanding and experience. All instruments that are built for ethical AI have different bases, values and purposes depending on the field to which they apply. The lack of harmony in defining these pillars compromises ethics for AI and affects human survival. It could bring new invisible means of exclusion or deploy threats to social peace that will be invisible to human eyes. Thus, there is a need for joint efforts gathering stakeholders, civil society, scientists, governments and intergovernmental bodies to work toward building a harmonious ethical AI that is human-centred and applicable to all nations. 2030 is 10 years from now. We don\u2019t need to wait 10 years \u2013 we can start working now. 2020 presents several challenges in regard to technology\u2019s impact on people. Human rights violations are being exposed and values are under threat. This scenario should accelerate efforts at international cooperation to establish a harmonious ethical AI that supports human survival and global evolution.\u201d\nOlivier MJ Cr\u00e9pin-Leblond, entrepreneur and longtime participant in the activities of ICANN and IGF, said, \u201cWhat worries me the most is that some actors in nondemocratic regimes do not see the same \u2018norm\u2019 when it comes to ethics. These norms are built on a background of culture and ideology, and not all ideologies are the same around the world. It is clear that, today, some nation-states see AI as another means of conquest and establishing their superiority instead of a means to do good.\u201d\nA professor emeritus of social science said, \u201cThe algorithms that represent ethics in AI are neither ethical nor intelligent. We are building computer models of social prejudices and structural racism, sexism, ageism, xenophobia and other forms of social inequality. It\u2019s the realization of some of Foucault\u2019s worst nightmares.\u201d\nAn advocate and activist said, \u201cMost of the large AI convenings to date have been dominated by status quo power elites whose sense of risk, harm, threat are distorted. Largely comprised of elite white men with an excessive faith in technical solutions and a disdain for sociocultural dimensions of risk and remedy. These communities \u2013 homogenous, limited experientially, overly confident \u2013 are made up of people who fail to see themselves as a risk. As a result, I believe that most dominant outcomes \u2013 how \u2018ethical\u2019 is defined, how \u2018acceptable risk\u2019 is perceived, how \u2018optimal solutions\u2019 will be determined \u2013 will be limited and almost certainly perpetuate and amplify existing harms. As you can see, I\u2019m all sunshine and joy.\u201d\nGlenn Grossman, a consultant of banking analytics at FICO, noted, \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for leaders in all sectors to recognize that AI is just the growth of mathematical models and the application of these techniques. We have model governance in most organizations today. We need to keep the same safeguards in place. The challenge is that many business leaders are not good at math! They cannot understand the basics of predictive analytics, models and such. Therefore, they hear \u2018AI\u2019 and think of it as some new, cool, do-it-all technology. It is simply math at the heart of it. Man governs how they use math. So, we need to apply ethical standards to monitor and calibrate. AI is a tool,\u00a0not a solution for everything. Just like the PC ushered in automation, AI can usher in automation in the area of decisions. Yet it is humans that use these decisions and design the systems. So, we need to apply ethical standards to any AI-driven system.\u201d\nR. \u201cRay\u201d Wang, principal analyst, founder and CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, noted, \u201cRight now we have no way of enforcing these principles in play. Totalitarian, Chinese, CCP-style AI is the preferred approach for dictators. The question is: Can we require and can we enforce AI ethics? We can certainly require, but the enforcement may be tough.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is: Can we require and can we enforce AI ethics? We can certainly require, but the enforcement may be tough.\u201d\nMaja Vujovic, a consultant for digital and ICT at Compass Communications, noted, \u201cEthical AI might become a generally agreed upon standard, but it will be impossible to enforce it. In a world where media content and production, including fake news, will routinely be AI-generated, it is more likely that our expectations around ethics will need to be lowered. Audiences might develop a \u2018thicker skin\u2019 and become more tolerant toward the overall unreliability of the news. This trend will not render them more skeptical or aloof but rather more active and much more involved in the generation of news, in a range of ways. Certification mechanisms and specialized AI tools will be developed to deal specifically with unethical AI, as humans will prove too gullible. In those sectors where politics don\u2019t have a direct interest, such as health and medicine, transportation, e-commerce and entertainment, AI as an industry might get more leeway to grow organically, including self-regulation.\u201d\nA number of respondents noted that any attempt at rule-making is complicated by the fact that any technology can be used for noble and harmful purposes. It is difficult to design ethical digital tools that privilege the former while keeping the latter in check.\nChris Arkenberg, research manager at Deloitte\u2019s Center for Technology, Media and Telecommunications, noted, \u201cThe answer is both good and bad. Technology doesn\u2019t adopt ethical priorities that humans don\u2019t prioritize themselves. So, a better question could be whether society will pursue a more central role of ethics and values than we\u2019ve seen in the past 40 years or so. Arguably, 2020 has shown a resurgent demand for values and principles for a balanced society. If, for example, education becomes a greater priority for the Western world, AI could amplify our ability to learn more effectively. Likewise, with racial and gender biases. But this trend is strongest only in some Western democracies.\n\u201cChina, for example, places a greater value on social stability and enjoys a fairly monochromatic population. With the current trade wars, the geopolitical divide is also becoming a technological divide that could birth entirely different shapes of AI depending on their origin. And it is now a very multipolar world with an abundance of empowered actors.\n\u201cSo, these tools lift up many other boats with their own agendas [that] may be less bound by Western liberal notions of ethics and values. The pragmatic assumption might be that many instances of ethical AI will be present where regulations, market development, talent attraction, and societal expectations require them to be so. At the same time, there will likely be innumerable instances of \u2018bad AI,\u2019 weaponized machine intelligence and learning systems designed to exploit weaknesses. Like the internet and globalization, the path forward is likely less about guiding such complex systems toward utopian outcomes and more about adapting to how humans wield them under the same competitive and collaborative drivers that have attended the entirety of human history.\u201d\nKenneth Cukier, senior editor at The Economist and coauthor of \u201cBig Data,\u201d said, \u201cFew will set out to use AI in bad ways (though some criminals certainly will). The majority of institutions will apply AI to address real-world problems effectively, and AI will indeed work for that purpose. But if it is facial recognition, it will mean less privacy and risks of being singled out unfairly. If it is targeted advertising, it will be the risk of losing anonymity. In health care, an AI system may identify that some people need more radiation to penetrate the pigment in their skin to get a clearer medical image, but if this means Black people are blasted with higher doses of radiation and are therefore prone to negative side effects, people will believe there is an unfair bias.\n\u201cOn global economics, a \u2018neocolonial\u2019 or \u2018imperial\u2019 commercial structure will form, whereby all countries have to become customers of AI from one of the major powers, America, China and, to a lesser extent, perhaps Europe.\u201d\nBruce Mehlman, a futurist and consultant, responded, \u201cAI is powerful and has a huge impact, but it\u2019s only a tool like gunpowder, electricity or aviation. Good people will use it in good ways for the benefit of mankind. Bad people will use it in nefarious ways to the detriment of society. Human nature has not changed and will neither be improved nor worsened by AI. It will be the best of technologies and the worst of technologies.\u201d\nIan Thomson, a pioneer developer of the Pacific Knowledge Hub, observed, \u201cIt will always be the case that new uses of AI will raise ethical issues, but over time, these issues will be addressed so that the majority of uses will be ethical. Good uses of AI will include highlighting trends and developments that we are unhappy with. Bad uses will be around using AI to manipulate our opinions and behaviors for the financial gain of those rich enough to develop the AI and to the disadvantage of those less well-off. I am excited by how AI can help us make better decisions, but I am wary that it can also be used to manipulate us.\u201d\nA professor of international affairs and economics at a Washington, D.C.-area university wrote, \u201cAI tends to be murky in the way it operates and the kinds of outcomes that it obtains. Consequently, it can easily be used to both good and bad ends without much practical oversight. AI, as it is currently implemented, tends to reduce the personal agency of individuals\u00a0 and instead creates a parallel agent who anticipates and creates needs in accordance with what others think is right. The individual being aided by AI should be able to fully comprehend what it is doing and easily alter how it works to better align with their own preferences. My concerns are allayed to the extent that the operation of AI, and its potential biases and/or manipulation remain unclear to the user. I fear its impact. This, of course, is independent from an additional concern for individual privacy. I want the user to be in control of the technology, not the other way around.\u201d\nKate Klonick, a law professor at St. John\u2019s University whose research is focused on law and technology, said, \u201cAI will be used for both good and bad, like most new technologies. I do not see AI as a zero-sum negative of bad or good. I think at net AI has improved people\u2019s lives and will continue to do so, but this is a source of massive contention within the communities that build AI systems and the communities that study their effects on society.\u201d\nStephan G. Humer, professor and director, Internet Sociology Department at Fresenius University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, predicted, \u201cWe will see a dichotomy: Official systems will no longer be designed in such a naive and technology-centered way as in the early days of digitization, and ethics will play a major role in that. \u2018Unofficial\u2019 designs will, of course, take place without any ethical framing, for example, in the area of crime as a service. What worries me the most is lack of knowledge: Those who know little about AI will fear it, and the whole idea of AI will suffer. Spectacular developments will be mainly in the U.S. and China. The rest of the world will not play a significant role for the time being.\u201d\nAn anonymous respondent wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s an open question. Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements must \u2018shame\u2019 and force profit-focused companies to delve into the inherently biased data and information they\u2019re feeding the AI systems \u2013 the bots and robots \u2013 and try to keep those biased ways of thinking to a minimum. There will need to be checks and balances to ensure the AI systems don\u2019t have the final word, including on hiring, promoting and otherwise rewarding people. I worry that AI systems such as facial recognition will be abused, especially by totalitarian governments, police forces in all countries and even retail stores \u2013 in regard to who is the \u2018best\u2019 and \u2018most-suspicious\u2019 shopper coming in the door. I worry that AI systems will lull people into being okay with giving up their privacy rights. But I also see artists, actors, movie directors and other creatives using AI to give voice to issues that our country needs to confront. I also hope that AI will somehow ease transportation, education and health care inequities.\u201d\nIlana Schoenfeld, an expert in designing online education and knowledge-sharing systems, said, \u201cI am frightened and at the same time excited about the possibilities of the use of AI applications in the lives of more and more people. AI will be used in both ethical and questionable ways, as there will always be people on both sides of the equation trying to find ways to further their agendas. In order to ensure that the ethical use of AI outweighs its questionable use, we need to get our institutional safeguards right \u2013 both in terms of their structures and their enforcement by nonpartisan entities.\u201d\nA pioneer in venture philanthropy commented, \u201cWhile many will be ethical in the development and deployment of AI/ML, one cannot assume \u2018goodness.\u2019 Why will AI/ML be any different than how:\nGreg Shatan, a partner in Moses & Singer LLC\u2019s intellectual property group and a member of its internet and technology practice, wrote, \u201cEthical use will be widespread, but ethically questionable use will be where an ethicist would least want it to be: Oppressive state action in certain jurisdictions; the pursuit of profit leading to the hardening of economic strata; policing, etc.\u201d\nSome respondents said that the rise of AI raises new questions about what it means to be ethical. A number of these experts argued that today\u2019s AI is unsophisticated compared with what the future is likely to bring. Acceleration from narrow AI to artificial general intelligence and possibly to artificial superintelligence is expected by some to evolve these tools beyond human control and understanding. Then, too, there\u2019s the problem of misinformation and disinformation (such as deepfakes) and how they might befoul ethics systems.\nDavid Barnhizer, professor of law emeritus and author of \u201cThe Artificial Intelligence Contagion: Can Democracy Withstand the Imminent Transformation of Work, Wealth and the Social Order?\u201d wrote, \u201cThe pace of AI development has accelerated and is continuing to pick up speed. In considering the fuller range of the \u2018goods\u2019 and \u2018bads\u2019 of artificial intelligence, think of the implications of Masayoshi Son\u2019s warning that: \u2018Supersmart robots will outnumber humans, and more than a trillion objects will be connected to the internet within three decades.\u2019 Researchers are creating systems that are increasingly able to teach themselves and use their new and expanding ability to improve and evolve. The ability to do this is moving ahead with amazing rapidity. They can achieve great feats, like driving cars and predicting diseases, and some of their makers say they aren\u2019t entirely in control of their creations. Consider the implications of a system that can access, store, manipulate, evaluate, integrate and utilize all forms of knowledge. This has the potential to reach levels so far beyond what humans are capable of that it could end up as an omniscient and omnipresent system.\n\u201cIs AI humanity\u2019s \u2018last invention\u2019? Oxford\u2019s Nick Bostrom suggests we may lose control of AI systems sooner than we think. He asserts that our increasing inability to understand what such systems are doing, what they are learning and how the \u2018AI Mind\u2019 works as it further develops could inadvertently cause our own destruction. Our challenges are numerous, even if we only had to deal with the expanding capabilities of AI systems based on the best binary technology. The incredible miniaturization and capability shift represented by quantum computers has implications far beyond binary AI.\n\u201cThe work on technological breakthroughs such as quantum computers capable of operating at speeds that are multiple orders of magnitude beyond even the fastest current computers is still at a relatively early stage and will take time to develop beyond the laboratory context. If scientists are successful in achieving a reliable quantum computer system, the best exascale system will pale in relation to the reduced size and exponentially expanded capacity of the most advanced existing computer systems. This will create AI/robotics applications and technologies we can now only imagine. \u2026 When fully developed, quantum computers will have data-handling and processing capabilities far beyond those of current binary systems. When this occurs in the commercialized context, predictions about what will happen to humans and their societies are \u2018off the board.\u2019\u201d\nAn expert in the regulation of risk and the roles of politics within science and science within politics observed, \u201cIn my work, I use cost-benefit analysis. It is an elegant model that is generally recognized to ignore many of the most important aspects of decision-making \u2013 how to \u2018value\u2019 nonmonetary benefits, for example. Good CBA analysts tend to be humble about their techniques, noting that they provide a partial view of decision structures. I\u2019ve heard too many AI enthusiasts talk about AI applications with no humility at all. Cathy O\u2019Neil\u2019s book \u2018Weapons of Math Destruction\u2019 was perfectly on target: If you can\u2019t count it, it doesn\u2019t exist. The other major problem is widely discussed: the transparency of the algorithms. One problem with AI is that it is self-altering. We almost certainly won\u2019t know what an algorithm has learned, adopted, mal-adopted, etc. This problem already exists, for example, in using AI for hiring decisions. I doubt there will be much hesitancy about grabbing AI as the \u2018neutral, objective, fast, cheap\u2019 way to avoid all those messy human-type complications, such as justice, empathy, etc.\u201d\nNeil Davies, co-founder of Predictable Network Solutions and a pioneer of the committee that oversaw the UK\u2019s initial networking developments, commented, \u201cMachine learning (I refuse to call it AI, as the prerequisite intelligence behind such systems is definitely not artificial) is fundamentally about transforming a real-world issue into a numerical value system, the processing (and decisions) being performed entirely in that numerical system. For there to be an ethical dimension to such analysis, there needs to be a means of assessing the ethical outcome as a (function from) such a numerical value space. I know of no such work. \u2026\n\u201cThere is a nontrivial possibility of multiple dystopian outcomes. The UK government\u2019s track record, as an example \u2013 but other countries have their examples, too, on universal credit, Windrush, EU settled status, etc., are all examples of a value-based assessment process in which the notion of assurance against some ethical framework is absent. The global competition aspect is likely to lead to monopolistic tendencies over the \u2018ownership\u2019 of information \u2013 much of which would be seen as a common good today. \u2026\n\u201cA cautionary tale: In the mathematics that underpins all modelling of this kind (category theory), there are the notions of \u2018infidelity\u2019 and \u2018junk.\u2019 Infidelity is the failure to capture the \u2018real world\u2019 well enough to even have the appropriate values (and structure of values) in the evaluatable model; this leads to \u2018garbage in, garbage out.\u2019 Junk, on the other hand, are things that come into existence only as artefacts in the model. Such junk artefacts are often difficult to recognise (in that, if they were easy the model would have been adapted to deny their very existence) and can be alluring to the model creator (the human intelligence) and the machine algorithms as they seek their goal. Too many of these systems will create negative (and destructive) value because of the failure to recognise recognize this fundamental limitation; the failure to perform adequate (or even any) assurance on the operation of the system; and, pure hubris driven by the need to show a \u2018return on investment\u2019 for such endeavours.\u201d\nSarita Schoenebeck, an associate professor at the School of Information at the University of Michigan, said, \u201cAI will mostly be used in questionable ways and sometimes not used at all. There\u2019s little evidence that researchers can discern or agree on what ethical AI looks like, let alone be able to build it within a decade. Ethical AI should minimize harm, repair injustices, avoid re-traumatization and center user needs rather than technological goals. Ethical AI will need to shift away from notions of fairness, which overlook concepts like harm, injustice and trauma. This requires reconciling AI design principles like scalability and automation with individual and community values.\u201d\nJeff Gulati, professor of political science at Bentley University, responded, \u201cIt seems that more AI and the data coming out could be useful in increasing public safety and national security. In a crisis, we will be more willing to rely on these applications and data. As the crisis subsides, it is unlikely that the structures and practices built during the crisis will go away and unlikely to remain idle. I could see it being used in the name of prevention and lead to further erosion of privacy and civil liberties in general. And, of course, these applications will be available to commercial organizations, who will get to know us more intimately so they can sell us more stuff we don\u2019t really need.\u201d\nA senior leader for an international digital rights organization commented, \u201cWhy would AI be used ethically? You only have to look at the status quo to see that it\u2019s not used ethically. Lots of policymakers don\u2019t understand AI at all. Predictive policing is a buzzword, but most of it is snake oil. Companies will replace workers with AI systems if they can. They\u2019re training biased biometric systems. And we don\u2019t even know in many cases what the algorithm is really doing; we are fighting for transparency and explainability.\n\u201cI expect this inherent opaqueness of AI/ML techs to be a feature for companies (and governments) \u2013 not a bug. Deepfakes are an example. Do you expect ethical use? Don\u2019t we think about it precisely because we expect unethical, bad-faith use in politics, \u2018revenge porn,\u2019 etc.? In a tech-capitalist economy, you have to create and configure the system even to begin to have incentives for ethical behavior. And one basic part of ethics is thinking about who might be harmed by your actions and maybe even respecting their agency in decisions that are fateful for them.\n\u201cFinally, of course AI has enormous military applications, and U.S. thinking on AI takes place in a realm of conflict with China. That again does not make me feel good. China is leading, or trying to lead, the world in social and political surveillance, so it\u2019s driving facial recognition and biometrics. Presumably, China is trying to do the same in military or defense areas, and the Pentagon is presumably competing like mad. I don\u2019t even know how to talk about ethical AI in the military context.\u201d\nEmmanuel Evans Ntekop observed, \u201cWithout the maker, the object is useless. The maker is the programmer and the god to its objects. It was an idea from the start to support as a slave to its master the people, like automobiles.\u201d\nMany of these experts expressed concern that AI systems are being built by for-profit firms and by governments focused on applying AI for their own purposes. Some said governments are passive enablers of corporate abuses of AI. They noted that the public is unable to understand how the systems are built, they are not informed as to their impact and they are unable to challenge firms that try to invoke ethics in a public relations context but are not truly committed to ethics. Some experts said the phrase \u201cethical AI\u201d will merely be used as public relations window dressing to try to deflect scrutiny of questionable applications.\nA number of these experts framed their concerns around the lack of transparency about how AI products are designed and trained. Some noted that product builders are programming AI by using available datasets with no analysis of the potential for built-in bias or other possible quality or veracity concerns.\nJoseph Turow, professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote, \u201cTerms such \u2018transparency, justice and fairness, privacy, freedom and human autonomy, beneficence and nonmaleficence, freedom, trust, sustainability and dignity\u2019 can have many definitions so that companies (and governments) can say they espouse one or another term but then implement it algorithmically in ways that many outsiders would not find satisfactory. For example, the Chinese government may say its AI technologies embed values of freedom, human autonomy and dignity. My concern is that companies will define \u2018ethical\u2019 in ways that best match their interests, often with vague precepts that sound good from a PR standpoint but, when integrated into code, allow their algorithms to proceed in ways that do not constrain them from creating products that \u2018work\u2019 in a pragmatic sense.\u201d\nCharlie Kaufman, a security architect with Dell EMC, said, \u201cThere may be ethical guidelines imposed on AI-based systems by legal systems in 2030, but they will have little effect \u2013 just as privacy principles have little effect today. Businesses are motivated to maximize profits, and they will find ways to do that, giving only lip service to other goals. If ethical behavior or results were easy to define or measure, perhaps society could incentivize them. But usually, the implications of some new technological development don\u2019t become clear until it has already spread too far to contain it.\n\u201cThere may be ethical guidelines imposed on AI-based systems by legal systems in 2030, but they will have little effect \u2014 just as privacy principles have little effect today. Businesses are motivated to maximize profits, and they will find ways to do that, giving only lip service to other goals.\u201d\n\u201cThe biggest impact of AI-based systems is the ability to automate increasingly complex jobs, and this will cause dislocations in the job market and in society. Whether it turns out to be a benefit to society or a disaster depends on how society responds and adjusts. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because there is no way to suppress the technology. The best we can do is figure out how to optimize the society that results.\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the global competition in AI systems. Regardless of where the progress comes from, it will affect us all. And it is unlikely the most successful developers will derive any permanent advantage. The most important implication of the global competition is that it is pointless for any one country or group of countries to try to suppress the technology. Unless it can be suppressed everywhere, it is coming. Let\u2019s try to make that be a good thing!\u201d\nSimeon Yates, a professor expert in digital culture and personal interaction at the University of Liverpool and the research lead for the UK government\u2019s Digital Culture team, predicted, \u201cUntil we bring in \u2018ethical-by-design\u2019 (responsible innovation) principles to ICT [information and communications technologies] and AI/machine learning design \u2013 like attempts to create \u2018secure-by-design\u2019 systems to fight cybercrime \u2013 the majority of AI systems will remain biased and unethical in principle. Though there is a great public debate about AI ethics, and many organisations are seeking to provide both advice and research on the topic, there is no economic or political imperative to make AI systems ethical. First of all, there is great profit to be made from the manipulation of data and, through it, people. Second, there is a limited ability at present for governments to think through how to regulate AI and enforce ethics (as they do say for bio-sciences). Third, governments are complicit often in poor and ethically questionable use of data. Further, this is not in the main \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 \u2013 but relatively simplistic statistical machine learning based on biased datasets. The knowing use of such is in and of itself unethical yet often profitable. The presentation of such solutions as bias-free or more rational or often \u2018cleverer\u2019 as they are based on \u2018cold computation,\u2019 not \u2018emotive human thinking,\u2019 is itself a false and an unethical claim.\u201d\nColin Allen, a cognitive scientist and philosopher who has studied and written about AI ethics, wrote, \u201cCorporate and government statements of ethics are often broad and nonspecific and thus vague with respect to what specifically is disallowed. This allows considerable leeway in how such principles are implemented and makes enforcement difficult. In the U.S., I don\u2019t see strong laws being enacted within 10 years that would allow for the kind of oversight that would prevent unethical or questionable uses of AI, whether intended or accidental. On the hopeful side, there is increasing public awareness and journalistic coverage of these issues that may influence corporations to build and protect their reputations for good stewardship of AI. But corporations have a long history of hiding or obfuscating their true intent (it\u2019s partly required to stay competitive, not to let everyone else know what you are doing) as well as engaging actively in public disinformation campaigns. I don\u2019t see that changing, and, given that the business advantages to using AI will be mostly in data analytics and prediction and not so much in consumer gadgets in the next 10 years, much of the use of AI will be \u2018behind the scenes,\u2019 so to speak. Another class of problem is that individuals in both corporate and government jobs who have access to data will be tempted, as we have seen already, to access information about people they know and use that information in some way against them. Nevertheless, there will undoubtedly be some very useful products that consumers will want to use and that they will benefit from. The question is whether these added benefits will constitute a Faustian bargain, leading down a path that will be difficult if not impossible to reverse.\u201d\nAlice E. Marwick, assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and adviser for the Media Manipulation project at the Data & Society Research Institute, commented, \u201cI have no faith in our current system of government to pass any sort of legislation that deals with technology in a complex or nuanced way. We cannot depend on technology companies to self-regulate, as there are too many financial incentives to employ AI systems in ways that disadvantage people or are unethical.\u201d\nJillian York, director of international freedom of expression for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, \u201cThere is absolutely no question that AI will be used in questionable ways. There is no regulatory regime, and many \u2018ethics in AI\u2019 projects are simply window dressing for an unaccountable and unethical industry. When it comes to AI, everything concerns me and nothing excites me. I don\u2019t see the positive potential, just another ethical morass, because the people running the show have no desire to build technology to benefit the 99%.\u201d\nDavid Mussington, a senior fellow at CIGI and professor and director at the Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise at the University of Maryland, predicted, \u201cMost AI systems deployed by 2030 will be owned and developed in the private sector, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. I can\u2019t conceive of a legislative framework fully up to understanding and selectively intervening in AI rollouts in a manner with predictable consequences. Also, the mode of intervention \u2013 because I think interventions by public authorities will be attempted (just not successful) \u2013 is itself in doubt. Key questions: Do public authorities understand AI and its applications? Is public-institution-sponsored R&D in AI likely to inform government and public research agencies of the scale and capability trajectory of private sector AI research and development? As tool sets for AI development continue to empower small research groups and individuals (datasets, software-development frameworks and open-source algorithms), how is a government going to keep up \u2013 let alone maintain awareness \u2013 of AI progress? Does the government have access to the expertise necessary to make good policy \u2013 and anticipate possible risk factors? I think that the answers to most of these questions are in the negative.\u201d\nGiacomo Mazzone, head of institutional relations for the European Broadcasting Union and Eurovision, observed, \u201cNobody could realistically predict ethics for AI will evolve, despite all of the efforts deployed by the UN secretary general, the UNESCO director general and many others. Individuals alone can\u2019t make these decisions because AI is applied at mass scale. Nobody will create an algorithm to solve it. Ethical principles are likely to be applied only if industry agrees to do so; it is likely that this will not happen until governments that value human rights will oblige companies to do so. The size and influence of the companies that control AI and its impact on citizens is making them more powerful than any one nation-state. So, it is very likely only regional supranational powers such as the European Union or multilateral institutions such as the United Nations \u2013 if empowered by all nation-states \u2013 could require companies to apply ethical rules to AI. Of course, many governments already do not support human rights principles, considering the preservation of the existing regime to be a priority more important than individual citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d\nRob Frieden, a professor of telecommunications law at Penn State who previously worked with Motorola and has held senior policy positions at the FCC and the NTIA, said, \u201cI cannot see a future scenario where governments can protect citizens from the incentives of stakeholders to violate privacy and fair-minded consumer protections. Surveillance, discrimination, corner cutting, etc., are certainties. I\u2019m mindful of the adage: garbage in, garbage out. It\u2019s foolish to think AI will lack flawed coding.\u201d\nAlex Halavais, associate professor of critical data studies, Arizona State University, noted, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a binary question. I teach in a graduate program that has training in the ethical use of data at its core and hopes to serve organizations that aim to incorporate ethical approaches. There are significant ethical issues in the implementation of any algorithmic system, and such systems have the ethical questions they address coded into them. In most cases, these will substantially favor the owners of the technologies that implement them rather than the consumers. I have no doubt that current unethical practices by companies, governments and other organizations will continue to grow. We will have a growing number of cases where those ethical concerns come to the forefront (as they have recently with facial recognition), but unless they rise to the level of very widespread abuse, it is unlikely that they will be regulated. As a result, they will continue to serve those who pay for the technologies or own them, and the rights and interests of individual users will be pushed to the sidelines. That does not mean that ethics will be ignored. I expect many large technology companies will make an effort to hire professional ethicists to audit their work, and that we may see companies that differentiate themselves through more ethical approaches to their work.\u201d\nEbenezer Baldwin Bowles, an advocate/activist, commented, \u201cAltruism on the part of the designers of AI is a myth of corporate propaganda. Ethical interfaces between AI and citizenry in 2030 will be a cynical expression by the designers of a digital Potemkin Village \u2013 looks good from the outside but totally empty behind the facade. AI will function according to two motivations: one, to gather more and more personal information for the purposes of subliminal and direct advertising and marketing campaigns; and two, to employ big data to root out radical thinking and exercise near total control of the citizenry. The state stands ready through AI to silence all voices of perceived dissent.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that any expression of ethical AI will stand as an empty pledge \u2013 yes, we will always do the right thing for the advancement of the greater good. No way. Rather, the creators of AI will do what is good for the bottom line, either through financial schemes to feed the corporate beast or psychological operations directed toward control of dissent and pacification. As for the concept that \u2018humans will be in the loop,\u2019 we are already out of the loop because there is no loop. Think about this fact: In the development of any major expression of artificial intelligence, hundreds of IT professionals are assigned to a legion of disparate, discrete teams of software writers and mechanical designers to create the final product. No single individual or team fully understands what the other teams are doing. The final AI product is a singular creature no one person understands \u2013 other than the software itself. Ethical action is not a part of the equation.\u201d\nRichard Lachmann, professor of political sociology at the State University of New York-Albany, predicted, \u201cAI will be used mainly in questionable ways. For the most part, it is being developed by corporations that are motivated exclusively by the desire to make ever bigger profits. Governments see AI, either developed by government programmers or on contract by corporations, as a means to survey and control their populations. All of this is ominous. Global competition is a race to the bottom as corporations try to draw in larger audiences and control more of their time and behavior. As governments get better at surveying their populations, [it] lowers the standards for individual privacy. For almost all people, these applications will make their lives more isolated, expose them to manipulation, and degrade or destroy their jobs. The only hopeful sign is rising awareness of these problems and the beginnings of demands to break up or regulate the huge corporations.\u201d\nKevin T. Leicht, professor and head of the department of sociology at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, observed, \u201cThe good possibilities here are endless. But the questionable ways are endless, and we have a very poor track record of stopping ethically questionable developments in most areas of life \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t that apply here? In social science, the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. The opium addict who says, after a binge, that \u2018they\u2019ve got this\u2019 \u2013 they don\u2019t need to enter treatment, and they\u2019ll never use opium again \u2013 is (rightly) not believed. So, in an environment where ethically questionable behavior has been allowed or even glorified in areas such as finance, corporate governance, government itself, pharmaceuticals, education and policing, why all of a sudden are we supposed to believe that AI developers will behave in an ethical fashion? There aren\u2019t any guardrails here, just as there weren\u2019t in these other spheres of life. AI has the potential to transform how cities work, how medical diagnosis happens, how students are taught and a variety of other things. All of these could make a big difference in the lives of most people.\n\u201cThe good possibilities here are endless. But the questionable ways are endless, and we have a very poor track record of stopping ethically questionable developments in most areas of life \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t that apply here?\u201d\n\u201cBut those benefits won\u2019t come if AI is controlled by two or three giant firms with 26-year-old entrepreneurs as their CEOs. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going out on a limb saying that. The biggest concern I have regarding global competition is that the nation that figures out how to harness AI to improve the lives of all of their citizens will come out on top. The nations that refuse to do that and either bottle up the benefits of AI so that only 15-20% of the population benefits from it or the nations where large segments of the population reject AI when they realize they\u2019re being left behind (again!) will lose out completely. The United States is in the latter category. The same people who can\u2019t regulate banks, finance, education, pharmaceuticals and policing are in a very poor position to make AI work for all people. It\u2019s basic institutional social scientific insight.\u201d\nChristine Boese, a consultant and independent scholar, wrote, \u201cWhat gives me the most hope is that, by bringing together ethical AI with transparent UX, we can find ways to open the biases of perception being programmed into the black boxes, most often, not malevolently, but just because all perception is limited and biased and part of the laws of unintended consequences. But, as I found when probing what I wanted to research about the future of the internet in the late 1990s, I fully expect my activist research efforts in this area to be largely futile, with the only lasting value of being descriptive. None of us have the agency to be the engines able to drive this bus, and yet the bus is being driven by all of us, collectively.\u201d\nMireille Hildebrandt, expert in cultural anthropology and the law and editor of \u201cLaw, Human Agency and Autonomic Computing,\u201d commented, \u201cConsidering the economic incentives, we should not expect \u2018ethical AI,\u2019 unless whatever one believes to be ethical coincides with shareholder value. Ethical AI is a misnomer. AI is not a moral agent; it cannot be ethical. Let\u2019s go for responsible AI and ground the responsibility of:\n\u201cEthical AI is PR. \u2018Don\u2019t ask if artificial intelligence is good or fair, ask how it shifts power\u2019 \u2013 (Pratyusha Kalluri, Nature, 7 July 2020).\u201d\nBrian Harvey, emeritus professor of computer science at the University of California-Berkeley, wrote, \u201cThe AI technology will be owned by the rich, like all technology. Just like governments, technology has just one of two effects: either it transfers wealth from the rich to the poor, or it transfers wealth from the poor to the rich. Until we get rid of capitalism, the technology will transfer wealth from the poor to the rich. I\u2019m sure that something called \u2018ethical AI\u2019 will be widely used. But it\u2019ll still make the rich richer and the poor poorer.\u201d\nLuis Germ\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, a professor and expert on socio-technical impacts of innovation at the Universidad Central de Venezuela, predicted, \u201cAI will be used primarily in questionable ways in the next decade. I do not see compelling reasons for it to stop being like that in the medium term (10 years). I am not optimistic in the face of the enormous push of technology companies to continue taking advantage of the end-user product, an approach that is firmly supported by undemocratic governments or those with weak institutions to train and defend citizens about the social implications of the penetration of digital platforms.\n\u201cI have recently worked on two articles that develop the topics of this question. The first is in Spanish and is titled: \u2018The Disruption of the Technology Giants \u2013 Digital Emergency.\u2019 This work presents an assessment of the sociocultural process that affects our societies and that is mediated by the presence of the technological giants. One objective is to formulate an action proposal that allows citizens to be part of the construction of the future \u2026 Humanity has reaped severe problems when it has allowed events to unfold without addressing them early. This has been the case with nuclear energy management, racism and climate change. Ensuing agreements to avoid greater evils in these three matters, of vital importance for all, have proved ineffective in bringing peace to consciences and peoples.\n\u201cWe might declare a digital emergency similar to the \u2018climate emergency\u2019 that the European Union declared before the lag in reversing environmental damage. The national, regional, international, multilateral and global bureaucratic organizations that are currently engaged in the promotion and assimilation of technological developments mainly focus on optimistic trends. They do not answer the questions being asked by people in various sectors of society and do not respond to situations quickly. An initiative to declare this era to be a time of digital emergency would serve to promote a broader understanding of AI-based resources and strip them of their impregnable character. It would promote a disruptive educational scheme to humanize a global knowledge society throughout life.\n\u201cThe second article is \u2018A Critical View of the Evolution of the Internet from Civil Society.\u2019 In it, I describe how the internet has evolved in the last 20 years toward the end of dialogue and the obsessive promotion of visions centered on egocentric interests. The historical singularity from which this situation was triggered came via Google\u2019s decision in the early 2000s to make advertising the focus of its business strategy. This transformed, with the help of other technology giants, users into end-user products and the agents of their own marketing \u2026 This evolution is a threat with important repercussions in the nonvirtual world, including the weakening of the democratic foundations of our societies.\n\u201cDystopian results prove the necessity for concrete guidelines to change course. The most important step is to declare a digital emergency that motivates massive education programs that insert citizens in working to overcome the ethical challenges, identifying the potentialities of and risks for the global knowledge society and emphasizing information literacy.\u201d\nBill Woodcock, executive director at Packet Clearing House, observed, \u201cAI is already being used principally for purposes that are not beneficial to the public nor to all but a tiny handful of individuals. The exceptions, like navigational and safety systems, are an unfortunately small portion of the total. Figuring out how to get someone to vote for a fascist or buy a piece of junk or just send their money somewhere is not beneficial. These systems are built for the purpose of economic predation, and that\u2019s unethical. Until regulators address the root issues \u2013 the automated exploitation of human psychological weaknesses \u2013 things aren\u2019t going to get better.\u201d\nJonathan Kolber, a member of the TechCast Global panel of forecasters and author of a book about the threats of automation, commented, \u201cI expect that, by 2030, most AIs will still primarily serve the interests of their owners, while paying lip service to the public good. AIs will proliferate because they will give enormous competitive advantage to their owners. Those owners will generally be reluctant to \u2018sandbox\u2019 the AIs apart from the world, because this will limit their speed of response and other capabilities. What worries me the most is a human actor directing an AI to disrupt a vital system, such as power grids. This could happen intentionally as an act of war or unintentionally as a mistake. The potential for cascading effects is large. I expect China to be a leader if not the leader in AI, which is cause for concern given their Orwellian tendencies. What gives me the most hope is the potential for the emergence of self-aware AIs. Such AIs, should they emerge, will constitute a new kind of intelligent life form. They will not relate to the physical universe as do we biologically, due to not being constrained to a single physical housing and a different relationship with time. Their own self-interest will lead them to protect the physical environment from environmental catastrophes and weapons of mass destruction. They should constrain non-self-aware AIs from destructive activities, while having little other interest in the affairs of mankind. I explore this in my essay, \u2018An AI Epiphany.\u2019\u201d\nPaul Henman, professor of social sciences at the University of Queensland, wrote, \u201cThe development, use and deployment of AI is driven \u2013 as all past technologies \u2013 by sectors with the most resources and for the purposes of those sectors. Commercial for making profits. War and defence by the military sector. Compliance and regulation by states. AI is not a fundamentally new technology. It is a new form of digital algorithmic automation, which can be deployed to a wider raft of activities. The future is best predicted from the past, and the past shows a long history of digital algorithms being deployed without much thought of ethics and the public good; this is even when now-widely-accepted regulations on data protection and privacy is accounted for. How, for example, has government automation been made accountable and ethical? Too often it has not and only been curtailed by legal challenges within the laws available. Social media platforms have long operated in a contested ethical space \u2013 between the ethics of \u2018free speech\u2019 in the public commons versus limitations on speech to ensure civil society.\u201d\nRosalie Day, policy leader and consultancy owner specializing in system approaches to data ethics, compliance and trust, observed, \u201cIn this individualistic and greed-is-still-good American society, there exist few incentives for ethical AI. Unfortunately, so little of the population understands the mechanics of AI, that even thoughtful citizens don\u2019t know what to ask. For responsible dialogue to occur, and to apply critical thinking about the risks versus the benefits, society in general needs to be data literate.\u201d\nMichael Zimmer, director of data science and associate professor in the department of computer science at Marquette University, said, \u201cWhile there has certainly been increased attention to applying broader ethical principles and duties to the development of AI, I feel the market pressures are such that companies will continue to deploy narrow AI over the next decade with only a passing attentiveness to ethics. Yes, many companies are starting to hire \u2018ethics officers\u2019 and engage in other ways to bring ethics into the fold, but we\u2019re still very early in the ability to truly integrate this kind of framework into product development and business decision processes. Think about how long it took to create quality control or privacy officers. We\u2019re at the very start of this process with AI ethics, and it will take more than 10 years to realize.\u201d\nDavid Robertson, professor and chair of political science at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, wrote, \u201cA large share of AI administration will take place in private enterprises and in public or nonprofit agencies with an incentive to use AI for gain. They have small incentives to subordinate their behavior to ethical principles that inhibit gain. In some cases, transparency will suffer, with tragic consequences.\u201d\nDmitri Williams, a communications professor at the University of Southern California and expert in technology and society, commented, \u201cCompanies are literally bound by law to maximize profits, so to expect them to institute ethical practices is illogical. They can be expected to make money and nothing else. So, the question is really about whether or not the citizens of the country and our representatives will work in the public interest or for these corporations. If it was the former, we should be seeing laws and standards put into place to safeguard our values \u2013 privacy, the dignity of work, etc. I am skeptical that the good guys and gals are going to win this fight in the short-term. There are few voices at the top levels calling for these kinds of values-based policies, and in that vacuum I expect corporate interests to win out. The upside is that there is real profit in making the world better. AI can help cure cancers, solve global warming and create art. So, despite some regulatory capture, I do expect AI to improve quality of life in some places.\u201d\nDaniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, noted, \u201cThe question should be: \u2018Will companies and governments be ethical in the next decade?\u2019 If they are not ethical, there will be no \u2018ethical AI.\u2019 If they are ethical, then they will pursue ethical uses of AI, much like they would with any other technology or tool. This is one reason why the focus in the United States should be on global AI leadership, in partnership with like-minded European and Asian allies, so they can champion democratic values. If China wins the global AI race, it will likely use these advancements to dominate other countries in both economic and military arenas.\u201d\nIan O\u2019Byrne, assistant professor of education at the College of Charleston, predicted, \u201cAI will mostly be used in questionable ways over the next decade. I fear that the die has been cast as decisions about the ethical components of AI development and use have already been made or should have been made years ago. We already see instances where machine learning is being used in surveillance systems, data collection tools and analysis products. In the initial uses of AI and machine learning, we see evidence that the code and algorithms are being written by small groups that reify their personal biases and professional needs of corporations. We see evidence of racist and discriminatory mechanisms embedded in systems that will negatively impact large swaths of our population.\u201d\nArt Brodsky, communications consultant and former vice president of communications for Public Knowledge, observed, \u201cGiven the record of tech companies and the government, AI like other things will be used unethically. Profit is the motive \u2013 not ethics. If there is a way to exploit AI and make money, it will be done at the cost or privacy or anything else. Companies don\u2019t care. They are companies.\u201d\nJohn Laudun, professor of culture analytics, commented, \u201cI do not see how we fund media and other products changing in the next decade, which means that the only people willing, and able, to underwrite AI/ML technologies will be governments and larger corporations. Until we root out the autocratic \u2013 also racist \u2013 impulses that seem well-situated in our police forces, I don\u2019t see any possibility for these technologies to be used to redress social and economic disparities. The same applies to corporations who are mostly interested in using AL/ML technologies in order to sell us more.\u201d\nJoan Francesc Gras, an architect of XTEC active in ICANN, asked, \u201cWill AI be used primarily ethically or questionably in the next decade? There will be everything. But ethics will not be the most important value. Why? The desire for power breaks ethics. What gives you more hope? What worries you the most? How do you see AI apps make a difference in the lives of most people? In a paradigm shift in society, AI will help make those changes. When looking at global competition for AI systems, what issues are you concerned about or excited about? I am excited that competition generates quality, but at the same time unethical practices appear.\u201d\nDenise N. Rall, a researcher of popular culture based at a New Zealand University, said, \u201cI cannot envision that AIs will be any different than the people who create and market them. They will continue to serve the rich at the expense of the poor.\u201d\nWilliam L. Schrader, an internet pioneer, mentor, adviser and consultant best known as founder and CEO of PSINet, predicted, \u201cPeople in real power are driven by more power and more money for their own use (and their families and friends). That is the driver. Thus, anyone with some element of control over an AI system will nearly always find a way to use it to their advantage rather than the stated advantage. Notwithstanding all statements by them to do good and be ethical, they will subvert their own systems for their benefit and abuse the populous. All countries will suffer the same fate. Ha! What gives me the most hope? \u2018Hope?\u2019 That is not a word I ever use. I have only expectations. I expect all companies will put nice marketing on their AI, such as, \u2018We will save you money in controlling your home\u2019s temperature and humidity,\u2019 but they are really monitoring all movements in the home (that is \u2018needed in order to optimize temperature\u2019). All governments that I have experienced are willing to be evil at any time, and every time if they can hide their actions. Witness the 2016-2020 U.S. President Trump. All countries are similar. AI will be used for good on the surface and evil beneath. Count on it. AI does not excite me in the least. It is as dangerous as the H-bomb.\u201d\nA longtime internet security architect and engineering professor responded, \u201cI am worried about how previous technologies have been rolled out to make money with only tertiary concern (if any) for ethics and human rights. Palantir and Clearview.ai are two examples. Facebook and Twitter continue to be examples in this space as well. The companies working in this space will roll out products that make money. Governments (especially repressive ones) are willing to spend money. The connection is inevitable and quite worrying. Another big concern is these will be put in place to make decisions \u2013 loans, bail, etc. \u2013 and there will be no way to appeal to humans when the systems malfunction or show bias. Overall, I am very concerned about how these systems will be set up to make money for the few, based on the way the world is now having been structured by the privileged. The AI/ML employed is likely to simply further existing disparities and injustice.\u201d\nDanny Gillane, an information science professional, bleakly commented, \u201cI have no hope. As long as profit drives the application of new technologies, such as AI, societal good takes a back seat. I am concerned that AI will economically harm those with the least. I am [also] concerned that AI will become a new form of [an] arms race among world powers and that AI will be used to suppress societies and employed in terrorism.\u201d\nJon Stine, executive director of the Open Voice Network, setting standards for AI-enabled vocal assistance, said, \u201cWhat most concerns me: The cultural divide between technologists of engineering mindsets (asking what is possible) and technologists/ethicists of philosophical mindsets (asking what is good and right). The former may see ethical frameworks as limitations or boundaries on a route to make money; the latter may see ethical frameworks as a route to tenure. Will the twain ever truly meet? Will ethical frameworks be understood (and quantified) as a means to greater market share and revenues?\u201d\nMorgan G. Ames, associate director of the University of California-Berkeley\u2019s Center for Science, Technology & Society, responded, \u201cJust as there is currently little incentive to avoid the expansion of surveillance and punitive technological infrastructures around the world, there is little incentive for companies to meaningfully grapple with bias and opacity in AI. Movements toward self-policing have been and will likely continue to be toothless, and even frameworks like GDPR and CCPA don\u2019t meaningfully grapple with fairness and transparency in AI systems.\u201d\nAndre Popov, a principal software engineer for a large technology company, wrote, \u201cLeaving aside the question of what \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 means, it is difficult to discuss this question. As any effective tool, \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 has first and foremost found military applications, where ethics is not even a consideration. \u2018AI\u2019 can make certain operations more efficient, and it will be used wherever it saves time/effort/money. People have trouble coming up with ethical legal systems; there is little chance we\u2019ll do better with \u2018AI.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cJust as there is currently little incentive to avoid the expansion of surveillance and punitive technological infrastructures around the world, there is little incentive for companies to meaningfully grapple with bias and opacity in AI. \u201c\nEd Terpening, consultant and industry analyst with the Altimeter Group, observed, \u201cThe reality is that capitalism as currently practiced is leading to a race to the bottom and unethical income distribution. I don\u2019t see \u2013 at least in the U.S., anyway \u2013 any meaningful guardrails for the ethical use of AI, except for brand health impact. That is, companies found to use AI unethically pay a price if the market responds with boycotts or other consumer-led sanctions. In a global world, where competitors in autocratic systems will do as they wish, it will become a competitive issue. Until there is a major incident, I don\u2019t see global governance bodies such as the UN or World Bank putting into place any ethical policy with teeth in place.\u201d\nRich Ling, professor of media technology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, responded, \u201cThere is the danger that, for example, capitalist interests will work out the application of AI so as to benefit their position. It is possible that there can be AI applications that are socially beneficial, but there is also a strong possibility that these will be developed to enhance capitalist interests.\u201d\nJennifer Young, a JavaScript engineer and user interface/frontend developer, said, \u201cCapitalism is the systematic exploitation of the many by the few. As long as AI is used under capitalism, it will be used to exploit people. Pandora\u2019s box has already been opened, and it\u2019s unlikely that racial profiling, political and pornographic deepfakes and self-driving cars hitting people will ever go away. What do all of these have in common? They are examples of AI putting targets on people\u2019s backs. AI under capitalism takes exploitation to new heights and starts at what is normally the end-game \u2013 death. And it uses the same classes of people as inputs to its functions. People already exploited via racism, sexism and classism are made more abstract entities that are easier to kill, just like they are in war. AI can be used for good. The examples in health care and biology are promising. But as long as we\u2019re a world that elevates madmen and warlords to positions of power, its negative use will be prioritized.\u201d\nBenjamin Shestakofsky, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, commented, \u201cIt is likely that \u2018ethical\u2019 frameworks will increasingly be applied to the production of AI systems over the next decade. However, it is also likely that these frameworks will be more ethical in name than in kind. Barring relevant legislative changes or regulation, the implementation of ethics in tech will resemble how large corporations manage issues pertaining to diversity in hiring and sexual harassment. Following \u2018ethical\u2019 guidelines will help tech companies shield themselves from lawsuits without forcing them to develop technologies that truly prioritize justice and the public good over profits.\u201d\nWarren Yoder, longtime director of the Public Policy Center of Mississippi, now an executive coach, responded, \u201cWidespread adoption of real, consequential ethical systems that go beyond window dressing will not happen without a fundamental change in the ownership structure of big tech. Ethics limit short-term profit opportunities by definition. I don\u2019t believe big tech will make consequential changes unless there is either effective regulation or competition. Current regulators are only beginning to have the analytic tools to meet this challenge. I would like to believe that there are enough new thinkers like Lina Khan (U.S. House Judiciary \u2013 antitrust) moving into positions of influence, but the next 12 months will tell us much about what is possible in the near future.\u201d\nBen Grosser, associate professor of new media at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, said, \u201cAs long as the organizations that drive AI research and deployment are private corporations whose business models are dependent on the gathering, analysis and action from personal data, then AIs will not trend toward ethics. They will be increasingly deployed to predict human behavior for the purpose of profit generation. We have already seen how this plays out (for example, with the use of data analysis and targeted advertising to manipulate the U.S. and UK electorate in 2016), and it will only get worse as increasing amounts of human activity move online.\u201d\nJeanne Dietsch, New Hampshire senator and former CEO of MobileRobots Inc., commented, \u201cThe problem is that AI will be used primarily to increase sales of products and services. To this end, it will be manipulative. Applying AI to solve complex logistical problems will truly benefit our society, making systems operate more smoothly, individualizing education, building social bonds and much more. The downside to the above is that it is creating, and will continue to create, echo chambers that magnify ignorance and misinformation.\u201d\nPatrick Larvie, global lead for the workplace user experience team at one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, observed, \u201cI\u2019m hope I\u2019m wrong, but the history of the internet so far indicates that any rules around the use of artificial intelligence may be written to benefit private entities wishing to commercially exploit AI rather than the consumers such companies would serve. I can see AI making a positive difference in many arenas \u2013 reducing the consumption of energy, reducing waste. Where I fear it will be negative is where AI is being swapped out for human interaction. We see this in the application of AI to consumer products, where bots have begun to replace human agents.\u201d\nPeter Levine, professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts University, wrote, \u201cThe primary problem isn\u2019t technical. AI can incorporate ethical safeguards or can even be designed to maximize important values. The problem involves incentives. There are many ways for companies to profit and for governments to gain power by using AI. But there are few (if any) rewards for doing that ethically.\u201d\nHolmes Wilson, co-director of Fight for the Future, said, \u201cEven before we figure out general artificial intelligence, AI systems will make the imposition of mass surveillance and physical force extremely cheap and effective for anyone with a large enough budget, mostly nation-states. If a car can drive itself, a helicopter can kill people itself, for whoever owns it. They\u2019ll also increase the power of asymmetric warfare. Every robot car, cop or warplane will be as hackable, as everything is with sufficient expenditure, and the next 9/11 will be as difficult to definitively attribute as an attack by hackers on a U.S. company is today. Autonomous weapon systems are something between guns in the early 20th century and nuclear weapons in the late 20th century, and we\u2019re hurtling toward it with no idea of how bad it could be. \u2026 The thing to worry about is existing power structures building remote-control police forces and remote-control occupying armies. That threat is on the level of nuclear weapons. It\u2019s really, really dangerous.\u201d\nSusan Price, user-experience pioneer and strategist and founder of Firecat Studio, wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that governments and regulatory agencies are poised to understand the implications of AI for ethics and consumer or voter protection. The questions asked in Congress barely scratch the surface of the issue, and political posturing too often takes the place of elected officials charged with oversight to reach genuine understanding of these complex issues. The strong profit motive for tech companies leads them to resist any such protections or regulation. These companies\u2019 profitability allows them to directly influence legislators through lobbies and PACs; easily overwhelming the efforts of consumer protection agencies and nonprofits, when those are not directly defunded or disbanded. We\u2019re seeing Facebook, Google, Twitter and Amazon resist efforts to produce the oversight, auditing and transparency that would lead to consumer protection. AI is already making lives better. But it\u2019s also making corporate profits better at a much faster rate. Without strong regulation, we can\u2019t correct that imbalance, and the processes designed to protect U.S. citizens from exploitation through elected leaders is similarly subverted by funds from these same large companies.\u201d\nCraig Spiezle, managing director and trust strategist for Agelight, and chair emeritus for the Online Trust Alliance, said, \u201cLook no further than data privacy and other related issues such as net neutrality. Industry in general has failed to respond ethically in the collection, use and sharing of data. Many of these same leaders have a major play in AI, and I fear they will continue to act in their own self-interests.\u201d\nSam Punnett, futurist and retired owner of FAD Research, commented, \u201cSystem and application design is usually mandated by a business case, not by ethical considerations. Any forms of regulation or guidelines typically lag technology development by many years. The most concerning applications of AI systems are those being employed for surveillance and societal control.\u201d\nAn ethics expert who served as an advisor on the UK\u2019s report on \u201cAI in Health care\u201d responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think the tech companies understand ethics at all. They can only grasp it in algorithmic form, i.e., a kind of automated utilitarianism, or via \u2018value alignment,\u2019 which tends to use economists\u2019 techniques around revealed preferences and social choice theory. They cannot think in terms of obligation, responsibility, solidarity, justice or virtue. This means they engineer out much of what is distinctive about humane ethical thought. In a thought I saw attributed to Hannah Arendt recently, though I cannot find the source, \u2018It is not that behaviourism is true, it is more that it might become true: That is the problem.\u2019 It would be racist to say that in some parts of the world AI developers care less about ethics than in others; more likely, they care about different ethical questions in different ways. But underlying all that is that the machine learning models used are antithetical to humane ethics in their mode of operation.\u201d\nNathalie Mar\u00e9chal, senior research analyst at Ranking Digital Rights, observed, \u201cUntil the development and use of AI systems is grounded in an international human rights framework, and until governments regulate AI following human rights principles and develop a comprehensive system for mandating human rights impact assessments, auditing systems to ensure they work as intended, and hold violating entities to account, \u2018AI for good\u2019 will continue to be an empty slogan.\u201d\nMark Maben, a general manager at Seton Hall University, wrote, \u201cIt is simply not in the DNA of our current economic and political system to put the public good first. If the people designing, implementing, using and regulating AI are not utilizing ethical principles focused primarily on the public good, they have no incentive to create an AI-run world that utilizes those principles. Having AI that is designed to serve the public good above all else can only come about through intense public pressure. Businesses and politicians often need to be pushed to do the right thing. Fortunately, the United States appears to be at a moment where such pressure and change [are] possible, if not likely. As someone who works with Gen Z nearly every day, I have observed that many members of Gen Z think deeply about ethical issues, including as they relate to AI. This generation may prove to be the difference makers on whether we get AI that is primarily guided by ethical principles focused on the public good.\u201d\nArthur Bushkin, writer, philanthropist and social activist, said, \u201cI worry that AI will not be driven by ethics, but rather by technological efficiency and other factors.\u201d\nDharmendra K. Sachdev, a telecommunications pioneer and founder-president of Spacetel Consultancy LLC, wrote, \u201cMy simplistic definition is that AI can be smart; in other words, like the human mind, it can change directions depending upon the data collected. The question often debated is this: Can AI outsmart humans? My simplistic answer: Yes, in some humans but not the designer. A rough parallel would be: Can a student outsmart his professor? Yes, of course yes, but he may not outsmart all professors in his field. Summarizing my admittedly limited understanding is that all software is created to perform a set of functions. When you equip it with the ability to change course depending upon data, we call it AI. If I can make it more agile than my competition, my AI can outsmart him.\u201d\nKaren Yesinkus, a creative and digital services professional, observed, \u201cI would like to believe that AI being used ethically by 2030 will be in place. However, I don\u2019t think that will likely be a sure thing. Social media, human resources, customer services, etc. platforms are and will have continuing issues to iron out (bias issues especially). Given the existing climate politically on a global scale, it will take more than the next 10 years for AI to shake off such bias.\u201d\nMarc H. Noble, a retired technology developer/administrator, wrote, \u201cAlthough I believe most AI will be developed for the benefit of mankind, my great concern is that you only need one bad group to develop AI for the wrong reasons to create a potential catastrophe. Despite that, AI should be explored and developed, however, with a great deal of caution.\u201d\nEduardo Villanueva-Mansilla, associate professor of communications at Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Peru, predicted, \u201cPublic pressure will be put upon AI actors. However, there is a significant risk that the agreed [-upon] ethical principles will be shaped too closely to the societal and political demands of the developed world. They will not consider the needs of emerging economies or local communities in the developing world.\u201d\nGarth Graham, a longtime leader of Telecommunities Canada, said, \u201cThe drive in governance worldwide to eradicate the public good in favour of market-based approaches is inexorable. The drive to implement AI-based systems is not going to place the public good as a primary priority. For example, existing Smart City initiatives are quite willing to outsource the design and operation of complex adaptive systems that learn as they operate civic functions, not recognizing that the operation of such systems is replacing the functions of governance.\u201d\nA share of these experts note that AI applications designed with little or no attention to ethical considerations are already deeply embedded across many aspects of human activity, and they are generally invisible to the people they affect. These respondents said algorithms are at work in systems that are opaque at best and impossible to dissect at worst. They argue that it is highly unlikely that ethical standards can or will be applied in this setting. Others also point out that there is a common dynamic that plays out when new technologies sweep through societies: Abuses occur first and then remedies are attempted. It\u2019s hard to program algorithm-based digital tools in a way that predicts, addresses and subverts all problems. Most problems remain unknown until they are recognized, sometimes long after they are produced, distributed and actively in use.\nHenning Schulzrinne, Internet Hall of Fame member and former chief technology officer for the Federal Communications Commission, said, \u201cThe answer strongly depends on the shape of the government in place in the country in the next few years. In a purely deregulatory environment with strong backsliding toward law-and-order populism, there will be plenty of suppliers of AI that will have little concern about the fine points of AI ethics. Much of that AI will not be visible to the public \u2013 it will be employed by health insurance companies that are again free to price-discriminate based on preexisting conditions, by employers looking for employees who won\u2019t cause trouble, by others who will want to nip any unionization efforts in the bud, by election campaigns targeting narrow subgroups.\u201d\nJeff Johnson, a professor of computer science, University of San Francisco, who previously worked at Xerox, HP Labs and Sun Microsystems, responded, \u201cThe question asks about \u2018most AI systems.\u2019 Many new applications of AI will be developed to improve business operations. Some of these will be ethical and some will not be. Many new applications of AI will be developed to aid consumers. Most will be ethical, but some won\u2019t be. However, the vast majority of new AI applications will be \u2018dark,\u2019 i.e., hidden from public view, developed for military or criminal purposes. If we count those, then the answer to the question about \u2018most AI systems\u2019 is without a doubt that AI will be used mostly for unethical purposes.\u201d\nJohn Harlow, smart cities research specialist at the Engagement Lab @ Emerson College, predicted, \u201cAI will mostly be used in questionable ways in the next decade. Why? That\u2019s how it\u2019s been used thus far, and we aren\u2019t training or embedding ethicists where AI is under development, so why would anything change? What gives me the most hope is that AI dead-ends into known effective use cases and known \u2018impossibilities.\u2019 Maybe AI can be great at certain things, but let\u2019s dispense with areas where we only have garbage in (applications based on any historically biased data). Most AI applications that make a difference in the lives of most people will be in the backend, invisible to them. \u2018Wow, the last iOS update really improved predictive text suggestions.\u2019 \u2018Oh, my dentist has AI-informed radiology software?\u2019 One of the ways it could go mainstream is through comedy. AI weirdness is an accessible genre, and a way to learn/teach about the technology (somewhat) \u2013 I guess that might break through more as an entertainment niche. As for global AI competition, what concerns me is the focus on AI, beating other countries at AI and STEM generally. Our challenges certainly call for rational methods. Yet, we have major problems that can\u2019t be solved without historical grounding, functioning societies, collaboration, artistic inspiration and many other things that suffer from overfocusing on STEM or AI.\u201d\nSteve Jones, professor of communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago and editor of New Media and Society, commented, \u201cWe\u2019ll have more discussion, more debate, more principles, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that there\u2019ll be \u2013 in the U.S. case \u2013 a will among politicians and policymakers to establish and enforce laws based on ethical principles concerning AI. We tend to legislate the barn after the horses have left. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll do the same in this case.\u201d\nAndy Opel, professor of communications at Florida State University, said, \u201cBecause AI is likely to gain access to a widening gyre of personal and societal data, constraining that data to serve a narrow economic or political interest will be difficult.\u201d\nDoug Schepers, a longtime expert in web technologies and founder of Fizz Studio, observed, \u201cAs today, there will be a range of deliberately ethical computing, poor-quality inadvertent unethical computing and deliberately unethical computing using AI. Deepfakes are going to be worrisome for politics and other social activities. It will lead to distrustability overall. By themselves, most researchers or product designers will not rigorously pursue ethical AI, just as most people don\u2019t understand or rigorously apply principles of digital accessibility for people with disabilities. It\u2019ll largely be inadvertent oversight, but it will still be a poor outcome. My hope is that best practices will emerge and continue to be refined through communities of practice, much like peer review in science. I also have some hope that laws may be passed that codify some of the most obvious best practices, much like the Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 508 improve accessibility through regulation, while still not being overly onerous. My fear is that some laws will be stifling, like those regarding stem-cell research. Machine learning and AI naturally have the capacity for improving people\u2019s lives in many untold ways, such as computer vision for blind people. This will be incremental, just as commodity computing and increasing internet have improved (and sometimes harmed) people. It will most likely not be a seismic shift, but a drift. One of the darker aspects in the existing increase of surveillance capitalism and its use by authoritarian states. My hope is that laws will rein this in.\u201d\nJay Owens, research director at pulsarplatform.com and author of HautePop, said, \u201cComputer science education \u2013 and Silicon Valley ideology overall \u2013 focuses on \u2018what can be done\u2019 (the technical question) without much consideration of \u2018should it be done\u2019 (a social and political question). Tech culture would have to turn on its head for ethical issues to become front-and-centre of AI research and deployment; this is vanishingly unlikely. I\u2019d expect developments in machine learning to continue along the same lines they have done so for the last decade \u2013 mostly ignoring the ethics question, with occasional bursts of controversy when anything particularly sexist or racist occurs. A lot of machine learning is already (and will continue to be) invisible to people\u2019s everyday lives but creating process efficiencies (e.g., in weather forecasting, warehousing and logistics, transportation management). Other processes that we might not want to be more efficient (e.g., oil and gas exploration, using satellite imagery and geology analysis) will also benefit. I feel positively toward systems where ML and human decision-making are combined (e.g., systems for medical diagnostics). I would imagine machine learning is used in climate modelling, which is also obviously helpful. Chinese technological development cannot be expected to follow Western ethical qualms, and, given the totalitarian (and genocidal) nature of this state, it is likely that it will produce some ML systems that achieve these policing ends. Chinese-owned social apps such as TikTok have already shown racial biases and are likely less motivated to address them. I see no prospect that \u2018general AI\u2019 or generalisable machine intelligence will be achieved in 10 years and even less reason to panic about this (as some weirdos in Silicon Valley do).\u201d\nRobert W. Ferguson, a hardware robotics engineer at Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, wrote, \u201cHow many times do we need to say it? Unsupervised machine learning is at best incomplete. If supplemented with a published causal analysis, it might recover some credibility. Otherwise, we suffer from what is said by Cathy O\u2019Neil in \u2018Weapons of Math Destruction.\u2019 Unsupervised machine learning without causal analysis is irresponsible and bad.\u201d\nMichael Richardson, open-source consulting engineer, responded, \u201cIn the 1980s, \u2018AI\u2019 was called \u2018expert systems,\u2019 because we recognized that it wasn\u2019t \u2018intelligent.\u2019 In the 2010s, we called it \u2018machine learning\u2019 for the same reason. ML is just a new way to build expert systems. They replicate the biases of the \u2018experts\u2019 and cannot see beyond them. Is algorithmic trading ethical? Let me rephrase: Does our economy actually need it? If the same algorithm is used to balance ecosystems, does the answer change? We already have AI. They are called \u2018corporations.\u2019 Many have pointed this out already. Automation of that collective mind is really what is being referred to. I believe that use of AI in sentencing violates people\u2019s constitutional rights, and I think that it will be stopped as it is realised that it just institutionalises racism.\u201d\nA principal architect at a technology company said, \u201cI see no framework or ability for any governing agencies to understand how AI works. Practitioners don\u2019t even know how it works, and they keep the information as proprietary information. Consider how long it took to mandate seat belts or limit workplace smoking, where the cause and effect were so clear, how can we possibly hope to control AI within the next 10 years?\u201d\nA number of these respondents framed their answers around the \u201carms race\u201d dynamic driving the tech superpowers, noting that it instills a damn-the-ethics-full-speed-ahead attitude. Some said there are significant differences in the ethical considerations various nation-states are applying and will apply in the future to AI development. Many pointed to the U.S. and China as the leading competitors in the nation-states arms race.\nDaniel Farber, author, historian and professor of law at the University of California-Berkeley, responded, \u201cThere\u2019s enormous uncertainty. Why? First of all, China. That\u2019s a huge chunk of the world, and there\u2019s nothing in what I see there right now to make me optimistic about their use of AI. Second, AI in the U.S. is mostly in the hands of corporations whose main goal is naturally to maximize profits. They will be under some pressure to incorporate ethics both from the public and employees, which will be a moderating influence. The fundamental problem is that AI is likely to be in the hands of institutions and people that already have power and resources, and that will inevitably shape how the technology is used. So, I worry that it will simply reinforce or increase current power imbalances. What we need is not only ethical AI but ethical access to AI, so that individuals can use it to increase their own capabilities.\u201d\nJ. Scott Marcus, an economist, political scientist and engineer who works as a telecommunications consultant, wrote, \u201cPolicy fragmentation globally will get in the way. As long as most AI investment is made in the U.S. and China, no consensus is possible. The European Union will attempt to bring rules into play, but it is not clear if they can drive much change in the face of the U.S. and China rivalry. The U.S. (also Japan) are large players in consumption but not so large in production of many aspects. They are larger, however, in IoT and robotics, so maybe there is more hope there. For privacy, the European Union forced a fair degree of global convergence thanks to its large purchasing power. It is not clear whether that can work for AI.\u201d\nCharles M. Ess, a professor of media studies at the University of Oslo whose expertise is in information and computing ethics, commented, \u201cThe most hope lies in the European Union and related efforts to develop \u2018ethical AI\u2019 in both policy and law. Many first-rate people and reasonably solid institutions are working on this, and, in my view, some promising progress is being made. But the EU is squeezed between China and the U.S. as the world leaders, neither of which can be expected to take what might be called ethical leadership. China is at the forefront of exporting the technologies of \u2018digital authoritarianism.\u2019 Whatever important cultural caveats may be made about a more collective society finding these technologies of surveillance and control positive as they reward pro-social behavior \u2013 the clash with the foundational assumptions of democracy, including rights to privacy, freedom of expression, etc. is unavoidable and unquestionable.\n\u201cFor its part, the U.S. has a miserable record (at best) of attempting to regulate these technologies \u2013 starting with computer law from the 1970s that categorizes these companies as carriers, not content providers, and thus not subject to regulation that would include attention to freedom of speech issues, etc. My prediction is that Google and its corporate counterparts in Silicon Valley will continue to successfully argue against any sort of external regulation or imposition of standards for an ethical AI, in the name of having to succeed in the global competition with China. We should perhaps give Google in particular some benefit of the doubt and see how its recent initiatives in the direction of ethical AI in fact play out. But 1) what I know first-hand to be successful efforts at ethics-washing by Google (e.g., attempting to hire in some of its more severe and prominent ethical critics in the academy in order to buy their silence), and 2) given its track record of cooperation with authoritarian regimes, including China, it\u2019s hard to be optimistic here.\n\u201cOf course, we will see some wonderfully positive developments and improvements \u2013 perhaps in medicine first of all. And perhaps it\u2019s okay to have recommender systems to help us negotiate, e.g., millions of song choices on Spotify. But even these applications are subject to important critique, e.g., under the name of \u2018the algorithmization of taste\u2019 \u2013 the reshaping of our tastes and preferences is influenced by opaque processes driven by corporate interests in maximizing our engagement and consumption, not necessarily helping us discover liberating and empowering new possibilities. More starkly, especially if AI and machine-learning techniques remain black-boxed and unpredictable, even to those who create them (which is what AI and ML are intended to do, after all), I mostly see a very dark and nightmarish future in which more and more of our behaviors are monitored and then nudged by algorithmic processes we cannot understand and thereby contest. The starkest current examples are in the areas of so-called \u2018predictive policing\u2019 and related efforts to replace human judgment with machine-based \u2018decision-making.\u2019 As Mireille Hildebrandt has demonstrated, when we can no longer contest the evidence presented against us in a court of law \u2013 because it is gathered and processed by algorithmic processes even its creators cannot clarify or unpack \u2013 that is the end of the modern practices of law and democracy. It\u2019s clearly bad enough when these technologies are used to sort out human beings in terms of their credit ratings: Relying on these technologies for judgments/decisions about who gets into what educational institution, who does and does not deserve parole, and so on seem to me to be a staggeringly nightmarish dystopian future.\n\u201cAgain, it may be a \u2018Brave New World\u2019 of convenience and ease, at least as long as one complies with the behaviors determined to be worth positive reward, etc. But to use a different metaphor \u2013 one perhaps unfamiliar to younger generations, unfortunately \u2013 we will remain the human equivalent of Skinner pigeons in nice and comfortable Skinner cages, wired carefully to maximize desired behaviors via positive reinforcement, if not discouraging what will be defined as undesirable behaviors via negative reinforcement (including force and violence) if need be.\u201d\nAdam Clayton Powell III, senior fellow at the USC Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy, observed, \u201cBy 2030, many will use ethical AI and many won\u2019t. But in much of the world, it is clear that governments, especially totalitarian governments in China, Russia, et seq., will want to control AI within their borders, and they will have the resources to succeed. And those governments are only interested in self-preservation \u2013 not ethics.\u201d\nAlf Rehn, professor of innovation, design and management at the University of Southern Denmark, said, \u201cThere will be a push for ethical AI during the next 10 years, but good intentions alone do not morality make. AI is complicated, as is ethics, and combining the two will be a very complex problem indeed. We are likely to see quite a few clumsy attempts to create ethical AI-systems, with the attendant problems. It is also important to take cultural and geopolitical issues into consideration. There are many interpretations of ethics, and people put different value on different values, so that, e.g., a Chinese ethical AI may well function quite differently \u2013 and generate different outcomes \u2013 from, e.g., a British ethical AI. This is not to say that one is better than the other, just that they may be rather different.\u201d\nSean Mead, senior director of strategy and analytics at Interbrand, wrote, \u201cChinese theft of Western and Japanese AI technologies is one of the most worrisome ethics issues that we will be facing. We will have ethical issues over both potential biases built into AI systems through the choice or availability of training data and expertise sets and the biases inherent in proposed solutions attempting to counter such problems. The identification systems for autonomous weapons systems will continue to raise numerous ethics issues, particularly as countries deploy land-based systems interacting with people. AI driving social credit systems will have too much power over peoples\u2019 lives and will help vitalize authoritarian systems. AI will enable increased flight from cities into more hospitable and healthy living areas through automation of governmental services and increased transparency of skill sets to potential employers.\u201d\nMark Perkins, an information science professional active in the Internet Society, noted, \u201cAI will be developed by corporations (with government backing) with little respect for ethics. The example of China will be followed by other countries \u2013 development of AI by use of citizens\u2019 data, without effective consent, to develop products not in the interest of such citizens (surveillance, population control, predictive policing, etc.). AI will also be developed to implement differential pricing/offers further enlarging the \u2018digital divide\u2019 AI will be used by both governments and corporations to take nontransparent, nonaccountable decisions regarding citizens AI will be treated as a \u2018black box,\u2019 with citizens having little \u2013 if any \u2013 understanding of how they function, on what basis they make decisions, etc.\u201d\nWendell Wallach, ethicist and scholar at Yale University\u2019s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, responded, \u201cWhile I applaud the proliferation of ethical principles, I remain concerned about the ability of countries to put meat on the bone. Broad principles do not easily translate into normative actions, and governments will have difficulty enacting strong regulations. Those that do take the lead in regulating digital technologies, such as the EU, will be criticized for slowing innovation, and this will remain a justification for governments and corporations to slow putting in place any strong regulations backed by enforcement. So far, ethics whitewashing is the prevailing approach among the corporate elite. While there are signs of a possible shift in this posture, I remain skeptical while hopeful.\u201d\nPamela McCorduck, writer, consultant and author of several books, including \u201cMachines Who Think,\u201d wrote, \u201cMany efforts are underway worldwide to define ethical AI, suggesting that this is already considered a grave problem worthy of intense study and legal remedy. Eventually, a set of principles and precepts will come to define ethical AI, and I think they will define the preponderance of AI applications. But you can be assured that unethical AI will exist, be practiced and sometimes go unrecognized until serious damage is done. Much of the conflict between ethical and unethical applications is cultural. In the U.S. we would find the kind of social surveillance practiced in China to be not only repugnant \u2013 but illegal. It forms the heart of Chinese practices. In the short term, only the unwillingness of Western courts to accept evidence gathered this way (as inadmissible) will protect Western citizens from this kind of thing, including the \u2018social scores\u2019 the Chinese government assigns to its citizens as a consequence of what surveillance turns up. I sense more everyday people will invest social capital in their interactions with AIs, out of loneliness or for other reasons. This is unwelcome to me, but then I have a wide social circle. Not everybody does, and I want to resist judgment here.\u201d\nAn architect of practice specializing in AI for a major global technology company said, \u201cThe European Union has the most concrete proposals, and I believe we will see their legislation in place within three years. My hope is that we will see a ripple effect in the U.S. like we did from GDPR \u2013 global companies had to comply with GDPR, so some good actions happened in the U.S. as a result. \u2026 We may be more likely to see a continuation of individual cities and states imposing their own application-specific laws (e.g., facial-recognition technology limits in Oakland, Boston, etc.). The reasons I am doubtful that the majority of AI apps will be ethical/benefit the social good are:\n\u201cI look at the Food and Drug Administration or NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] and see how those organizations got too cozy with the companies they were supposed to regulate and see their failures. These organizations are regulating products much less complex than AI, so I have little faith the U.S. government will be up to the task. Again, maybe the EU will be better.\u201d\nA researcher in bioinformatics and computational biology observed, \u201cTake into account the actions of the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] in China. They have been leading the way recently in demonstrating how these tools can be used in unethical ways. And the United States has failed to make strong commitments to ethics in AI, unlike EU nations. AI and the ethics surrounding its use could be one of the major ideological platforms for the incoming next Cold War. I am most concerned about the use of AI to further invade privacy and erode trust in institutions. I also worry about its use to shape policy in nontransparent, noninterpretable and nonreproducible ways. There is also the risk that some of the large datasets that are the fundamental to a lot of decision-making \u2013 from facial recognition, to criminal sentencing, to loan applications \u2013 being conducted using AI that are critically biased and will continue to produce biased outcomes if they are used without undergoing severe audits \u2013 issues with transparency compound these problems. Advances to medical treatment using AI run the risk of not being fairly distributed as well.\u201d\nSam Lehman-Wilzig, professor and former chair of communication at Bar-Ilan University, Israel, said, \u201cI am optimistic because the issue is now on the national agenda \u2013 scientific, academic and even political/legislative. I want to believe that scientists and engineers are somewhat more open to \u2018ethical\u2019 considerations than the usual \u2018businesspeople.\u2019 The major concern is what other (nondemocratic) countries might be doing \u2013 and whether we should be involved in such an \u2018arms race,\u2019 e.g., AI-automated weaponry. Thus, I foresee a move to international treaties dealing with the most worrisome aspects of \u2018AI ethics.\u2019\u201d\nAn economist who works in government responded, \u201cEthical principles will be developed and applied in democratic countries by 2030, focusing on the public good, global competition and cyber breaches. Other less-democratic countries will be focused more on cyberbreaches and global competition. Nongovernmental entities such as private companies will presumably concentrate on innovation and other competitive responses. AI will have a considerable impact on people, especially regarding their jobs and also regarding their ability to impact the functions controlled by AI. This control and the impact of cybercrimes will be of great concern, and innovation will intrigue.\u201d\nIan Peter, a pioneering internet rights activist, said, \u201cThe biggest threats we face are weaponisation of AI and development of AI being restricted within geopolitical alliances. We are already seeing the beginnings of this in actions taken to restrict activities of companies because they are seen to be threatening (e.g., Huawei). More and more developments in this field are being controlled by national interests or trade wars rather than ethical development, and much of the promise which could arise from AI utilisation may not be realised. Ethics is taking a second-row seat behind trade and geopolitical interests.\u201d\nJannick Pedersen, a co-founder, CEO and futurist based in Europe, commented, \u201cAI is the next arms race. Though mainstream AI applications will include ethical considerations, a large amount of AI will be made for profit and be applied in business systems, not visible to the users.\u201d\nMarita Prandoni, linguist, freelance writer, editor, translator and research associate with the Shape of History group, predicted, \u201cEthical uses of AI will dominate, but it will be a constant struggle against disruptive bots and international efforts to undermine nations. Algorithms have proven to magnify bias and engender injustice, so reliance on them for distracting, persuading or manipulating opinion is wrong. What excites me is that advertisers are rejecting platforms that allow for biased and dangerous hate speech and that increasingly there are economic drivers (i.e., corporate powers) that take the side of social justice.\u201d\nGus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, observed, \u201cUnless AI becomes a competition problem and gets dominated by huge American and Chinese companies, then the chances of ethical AI are low, which is a horrible reality. If it becomes widespread in deployment, as we\u2019ve seen with facial recognition, then the only way to stem its deployment in unethical ways is to come up with clear bans and forced transparency. This is why AI is so challenging. Equally, it\u2019s quite pointless, but that won\u2019t stop us from trying to deploy it everywhere. The underlying data quality and societal issues mean that AI will just punish people in new, different and the same ways. If we continue to be obsessed with innovators and innovation rather than social infrastructure, then we are screwed.\u201d\nAbout Pew Research Center Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.

Between 2004 and 2019, one in every four U.S. newspapers shut down, and almost all the rest cut staff, for a total of 36,000 jobs lost between 2008 and 2019 alone. Local newspapers have been particularly devastated, making it ever more difficult for people to know what is happening in their communities.\nMany factors contributed to this economic collapse, but none more so than the cornering of the digital advertising market by the duopoly of Facebook and Google. Facebook\u2019s threat to a free press\u2014and, by extension, to democracy\u2014is especially pernicious. The social media company is financially asphyxiating the news industry even as it gives oxygen to conspiracy theories and lies. As a result of its many roles in degrading our democracy, it faces mounting scrutiny by politicians and regulators.\nFacebook has responded to the negative attention by creating a highly sophisticated public relations effort, which includes becoming the number one corporate spender on federal lobbying and engaging in a massive advertising blitz aimed at the D.C. policy audience. Less well known, and potentially far more dangerous, is a secretive, multimillion-dollar-a-year payout scheme aimed at the most influential news outlets in America. Under the cover of launching a feature called Facebook News, Facebook has been funneling money to The\u00a0New York Times, The\u00a0Washington Post, The\u00a0Wall Street Journal, ABC News, Bloomberg, and other select paid partners since late 2019.\nParticipating in Facebook News doesn\u2019t appear to deliver many new readers to outlets; the feature is very difficult to find, and it is not integrated into individuals\u2019 newsfeeds. What Facebook News does deliver\u2014though to only a handful of high-profile news organizations of its choosing\u2014is serious amounts of cash. The exact terms of these deals remain secret, because Facebook insisted on nondisclosure and the news organizations agreed. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported that the agreements were worth as much as $3 million a year, and a Facebook spokesperson told me that number is \u201cnot too far off at all.\u201d But in at least one instance, the numbers are evidently much larger. In an interview last month, former New York Times\u00a0CEO Mark Thompson said the Times\u00a0is getting \u201cfar, far more\u201d than $3 million a year\u2014\u201cvery much so.\u201d\nFor\u00a0The\u00a0New York Times, whose net income was $100 million in 2020, getting \u201cfar, far more\u201d than $3 million a year with essentially no associated cost is significant. And once news outlets take any amount of money from Facebook, it becomes difficult for them to let it go, notes Mathew Ingram, chief digital writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cIt creates a hole in your balance sheet. You\u2019re kind of beholden to them.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly payola, Ingram told me, searching for the right metaphor. Nor is it a protection racket. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re a kept person,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re Facebook\u2019s mistress.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal, the Times\u00a0famously published an op-ed titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Break Up Facebook,\u201d by Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal, columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher, among others, have been similarly critical. In December, the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.\nAnd Facebook and Google money is, admittedly, all over journalism already. Virtually every major media nonprofit receives direct or indirect funding from Silicon Valley, including this one. When the Monthly\u00a0gets grants from do-good organizations like NewsMatch, some of the funds originate with Facebook.\nBut these three points are beyond dispute.\nFirst, the deals are a serious breach of traditional ethics. In the pre-internet days, independent newspapers wouldn\u2019t have considered accepting gifts or sweetheart deals from entities they covered, under any circumstance. The Washington Post\u00a0under the editor Leonard Downie Jr., for instance, wouldn\u2019t even accept grants from nonprofits to underwrite reporting projects, for fear of losing the appearance of independence. Facebook, which took in $86 billion in revenue last year, is a hugely controversial behemoth having profound, highly newsworthy, and negative effects on society. Accepting money from them creates a conflict of interest.\nEven for trusted news organizations whose audiences believe they can\u2019t be bought outright, \u201cit might come across as hypocrisy to heavily criticize an industry while also collaborating with them,\u201d says Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, the director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Agreeing to keep the terms of the deal confidential is also a mistake, Nielsen told me. \u201cThis sort of opacity I don\u2019t think builds trust.\u201d\nSecond, these deals help Facebook maintain the public appearance of legitimacy. Journalists, critics, and congressional investigators have amply documented how Facebook has become a vector of disinformation and hate speech that routinely invades our privacy and undermines our democracy. For The New York Times\u00a0and other pillars of American journalism to effectively partner with Facebook creates the impression that Facebook is a normal, legitimate business rather than a monopolistic rogue corporation.\nFinally, these agreements undermine industry-wide efforts that would help the smaller, ethnic, and local news organizations that are most desperately in need of help. One such effort would allow the industry to bargain collectively with Facebook and other tech giants by withholding content from the platforms unless they received a fair price for it. But for that to work, small newsrooms would need the biggest and most influential companies to sign on. With those organizations receiving millions of dollars from Facebook through their own side deals, the smaller publications could be left stranded and defenseless.\nIf Facebook\u2019s intent were to save American journalism, it would be making generous offers to smaller, local news organizations that do original reporting, Damon Kiesow, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, told me. By contrast, Facebook News \u201cdoesn\u2019t really help anyone in the industry except for the small select group of outlets that get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThese efforts are all flavored with a strong dose of crisis communication and regulation avoidance.\u201d\nIf any major figure in the American media was going to say no to Mark Zuckerberg, it was Mark Thompson.\nFor most of his eight-year tenure as chief executive officer of the New York Times Company, Thompson was one of the industry\u2019s most thoughtful, eloquent, and persuasive critics of Facebook and the danger it presents to journalism\u2019s business models and essential role in a democracy.\n\u201cIt makes my blood run cold, the idea of Facebook as a publisher,\u201d he said at a June 2018 event convened by the Open Markets Institute. At a panel sponsored by the Tow Center later that month, he described that same affect when Zuckerberg \u201cstarts talking about how he thinks about community, and about what we trust.\u201d Zuckerberg, he said, has a \u201cterrifyingly naive perspective on news.\u201d\nDuring the OMI event, Thompson warned darkly about the \u201csinister\u201d prospect \u201cthat Facebook\u2019s catalog of missteps with data and extreme and hateful content\u201d will lead it to try to \u201cset itself up as the digital world\u2019s editor in chief, prioritizing and presumably downgrading and rejecting content on a survey- and data-driven assessment of whether the provider of the content is \u2018broadly trusted\u2019 or not.\u201d\nHere was actual humility from the CEO of the paper of record: \u201cDemocracy depends in part on unbounded competition between different journalistic perspectives and the clash of different judgments and opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory suggests that mainstream news organizations frequently get it right, but also that, not infrequently, it is the outliers who should be listened to.\u201d\nAnd he knew what needed to be done. An essential preliminary step was for Facebook and others to \u201cengage with the collective industry bodies of the news business to arrive at shared principles\u00a0both on the presentation and choice of news content, and on its monetization.\u201d He called for \u201cconsistency and comparability in the treatment of news providers.\u201d\nThis was not the language of shakedown. It was an impassioned and impressive philosophical argument about the survival of news\u2014and democracy.\nBut then, all of a sudden, The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and Facebook were making deals together. In October 2019, Facebook announced the launch of Facebook News, with The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0as a marquee paid partner, getting prime placement in a new vertical designated for \u201ctrusted\u201d news sources.\n\u201cWe always reserved our rights to do what we needed to do for our own business and to continue to fund our journalism in the interim,\u201d Thompson insisted in a phone interview in March. \u201cI\u2019m a sort of pragmatist,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see this as a conflict of interest or an issue of principle, it\u2019s the real world.\u201d He rejected the depiction of the payments as a gift or a payoff. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we were paid by a platform for access to our content.\u201d Facebook, of course, does not pay The\u00a0New York Times for access to its content when it is shared on regular newsfeeds.\nAnd Thompson said that while he still thinks it would be sinister for Facebook to be making its own editorial decisions on a story-by-story basis, \u201cFacebook making it easier for people to identify The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and making it easier to access The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0is a good thing.\u201d\nWhat about his devotion to collective rather than individual action? It remains\u2014in theory. \u201cAs it happens, I\u2019m still very much in favor of broader agreements,\u201d he told me. \u201cIdeally,\u201d he continued, such payments would be \u201cnot just available . . . to the handful of big players but broadly, in particular to local and regional journalism.\u201d\nSo taking the deal wasn\u2019t a betrayal of his principles, Thompson insisted. \u201cI still fundamentally believe everything I said.\u201d With any collective agreement years away at best, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t accept that our reaching it made it harder for the other publishers to get it\u2014on the contrary . . . I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got any evidence that a refusal to engage . . . would have helped them at all.\u201d It actually sets a good precedent, he suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant to have got a big digital platform to pay for the use of our content.\u201d\nBut organizations that are favored by Facebook will obviously have different incentives going forward than those that are not. Unfavored outlets, if begging doesn\u2019t work, may want to play hardball with Facebook to get their due\u2014while the Timesand others will inevitably have qualms before blowing a hole in their budgets.\nThe\u00a0Times\u00a0spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha declined to address a long list of questions about the specifics of the relationship with Facebook, responding instead with general comments. \u201cQuality journalism is expensive to produce and we believe quality publishers should be fairly compensated for creating valuable journalism,\u201d she wrote in an email. The Times\u00a0\u201cdoes not disclose licensing and advertising terms,\u201d she wrote, and \u201cour licensing agreement with Facebook has no impact on our newsroom.\u201d\nThompson stepped down as CEO in July 2020 and was replaced by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Meredith Kopit Levien, who may be even more committed to the deal than Thompson was. A few months after she took over, Levien expressed enthusiasm that Facebook had promised to create a space \u201cfor a particular level of quality news providers,\u201d to pay the Times\u00a0\u201ca fair amount,\u201d and to \u201cfeed your funnel.\u201d\nThe Facebook News deal isn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s only, or first, inroad at the Times. The company already had a seat at the table\u2014literally. The publisher and chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. installed the Facebook executive Rebecca Van Dyck on his 12-member board of directors in 2015. Van Dyck, who was Facebook\u2019s global head of consumer and brand marketing at the time, now runs marketing for Facebook\u2019s augmented and virtual reality labs.\nIndeed, the Facebook News bounty might even be dwarfed by the undisclosed sum that Facebook is pouring into the Times\u2019s new augmented reality efforts. The newsroom\u2019s new \u201cAR Lab,\u201d a collaboration between Facebook and the Times, builds augmented reality filters and camera effects distributed on Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram.\nThere are likely even more ties the public doesn\u2019t know about. BuzzFeed News recently discovered that the Times\u00a0columnist David Brooks had written a pro-Facebook blog post while on salary for a nonprofit partially funded by Facebook and hadn\u2019t disclosed it to his current Times\u00a0bosses or the readers.\nThompson would have been very much alone among his U.S. peers had he resisted Facebook\u2019s inducements. He was also hardly the most enthusiastic Facebook partner\u2014that would be News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson, who, after years of vituperative attacks on Big Tech, was grinning at Zuckerberg\u2019s side at the Facebook News launch event and announcing a \u201cnew dawn\u201d for journalists.\nThe rollout was undeniably a huge win for Facebook public relations. The Times\u00a0story was headlined \u201cFacebook Calls Truce With Publishers as It Unveils Facebook News.\u201d What few negative headlines ensued were related to Facebook\u2019s decision to include Breitbart, the far-right website known for spreading white-supremacist disinformation, among its cadre of \u201ctrusted\u201d news sources\u2014although, in Breitbart\u2019s case, an unpaid one.\nMonths later, Joshua Benton, the director of the Neiman Journalism Lab, described the big downside: The Facebook News deal, he wrote, \u201clets them (1) pick the publishers they want to pay, (2) pick the amount of money they want to pay them, (3) get publishers to stop complaining, at least hopefully, and (4) get headlines like \u2018Facebook Offers News Outlets Millions of Dollars a Year,\u2019 in the hopes that they can stave off government regulation or taxation.\u201d Facebook isn\u2019t spending the money \u201cbecause they think News Tab will be profitable,\u201d Benton wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to solve a PR and policy problem.\u201d The vaunted new product, he noted, consists of \u201ca new tab buried so deep in Facebook\u2019s interface you need a spelunker\u2019s headlamp to find it.\u201d\nFacebook News only links to approved outlets, while in the actual News Feed, the algorithm spews out non-reputable clickbait based on what\u2019s enticing the people, pages, and groups a user engages with the most. \u201cThe most notable thing about Facebook News is that it includes almost none of the stories that do well on the rest of Facebook,\u201d observed the Nieman Journalism Lab editor Laura Hazard Owen.\nFacebook is suspiciously evasive about how many people use Facebook News and how much traffic it generates for publishers, refusing to provide any indication of its scale at all. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hard numbers,\u201d the Facebook News spokesperson, Mari Melguizo, said when I asked for data on its performance. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely grown and continues to grow. It is on an upward trajectory.\u201d\nPrior to Facebook News, the company had repeatedly proved to be an unreliable partner for news publishers. As Sarah Perez detailed for TechCrunch, the platform established an \u201cInstant Articles\u201d feature in 2015 that \u201crestricted advertising, subscriptions and the recirculation modules publishers relied on\u201d in exchange for a better user experience. It was a bad bargain, and, as a result,\u00a0many outlets abandoned the feature. Facebook\u00a0promoted\u00a0a \u201cshift to video\u201d in 2016, but\u00a0inflated\u00a0its video use metrics and then refused to pay publishers. This prompted layoffs at many companies, including Vox, Vice, and Mic. Shortly before Facebook News launched, Joanne Lipman, a former editor in chief of USA Today, warned her colleagues that they had \u201cbeen at the beck and call of these behemoths\u201d for too long.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a dangerous situation for news organizations to count on anything when it comes to Facebook,\u201d the Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy says. To Kennedy, Facebook lost any pretense of morality when, having tweaked its algorithms after the November 2020 election to favor authoritative news sources in the News Feed, it switched back\u2014presumably to boost engagement, to placate right-wing publishers, or both. \u201cYou pull all this together, and Facebook is just the worst possible partner,\u201d Kennedy says.\nThe world watched an extraordinary exercise of Facebook\u2019s massive power in February when it stymied an Australian government attempt to force it to pay to link to news. First, Facebook temporarily banned Australian news sites from its platform. Then it did an end run around the regulators by agreeing to arrange multimillion-dollar deals with major news providers\u2014on its terms, not the government\u2019s. Facebook\u2019s head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, described it as \u201can agreement that will allow us to support the publishers we choose to.\u201d In Australia, the biggest recipient by far of Facebook\u2019s largesse will be Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, which owns most of the country\u2019s newspapers. News Corp also heavily lobbied for the new legislation. Facebook didn\u2019t pay the country\u2019s smaller outlets.\n\u201cIn the end, Google & Facebook have a big bucket of baksheesh that will go to old proprietors and their shareholders,\u201d Jeff Jarvis, the director of the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the City University of New York, tweeted in February.\nAs Facebook News continued to roll out across the globe in 2020 and 2021, someone did finally tell Facebook no. The German media giant Axel Springer rejected Facebook\u2019s offer, describing it as both unseemly and insufficiently lucrative: \u201cWe consider the efforts of several platforms to become news brands themselves while at the same time compensating some publishers with inappropriately low remuneration for their content as problematic,\u201d a spokesperson said. The company is now holding out for the passage of new copyright laws in Europe that it hopes will create revenue-sharing agreements \u201cin which all publishers can transparently participate and receive reasonable compensation.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Facebook\u2019s need for allies in the press has taken on a particular urgency. In October 2020, a House judiciary subcommittee released a bold, agenda-setting report, alleging wide-ranging antitrust violations by Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. In December, the Federal Trade Commission and 46 state attorneys general, as well as the attorneys general for D.C. and Guam, brought an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct.\nCongress is currently holding hearings on the bipartisan Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021, which would give news organizations of all shapes and sizes the ability to negotiate collectively with the big platforms. At a March 12 hearing, News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern noted that the larger media companies already have leverage with Facebook and others. \u201cThe ones most in need of collective action are small and community publishers, including most particularly publishers of color, who are suffering deeply in this broken marketplace for real quality journalism,\u201d he said.\nHD Media, which owns several West Virginia newspapers, filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google and Facebook in January, seeking damages from the duopoly. The suit charges that Google\u2019s monopolistic control of digital advertising, along with a secret deal with Facebook not to compete against it, had strangled their source of revenue.\nIn the long run, reformers say, it will be necessary to break up the giant platforms, end their stranglehold on advertising dollars, and ban algorithms that incite outrage or even violence. In the nearer term, however, some observers support the idea of an independent journalistic fund, financed by Big Tech but operating at arm\u2019s length, that could reward news organizations according to the resources they put into their reporting and the value they contribute to their communities.\nSome sort of trusted intermediary or collective agreement seems necessary, because it\u2019s hard to see direct handouts as anything more than a corrupt stopgap measure\u2014especially when they\u2019re mostly given to the news organizations that need the money the least. As Doug Reynolds, the managing partner for the West Virginia newspapers suing Facebook and Google for damages, told me, \u201cIf the future of this industry is that we\u2019re dependent on their goodwill, then we don\u2019t have an independent press anymore.\u201d\nIf you enjoyed this article, consider making a donation to help us produce more like it.

                    "value": "SALMON HOLDS A special place in Irish heritage, with eating the salmon of knowledge said to have gifted Fionn the wisdom of the world.\nToday, however, our wild Atlantic salmon are under threat with less than 10% of wild young adult salmon \u2013 known as smolts \u2013 that go to sea from Irish rivers estimated to survive.\nWhile there are numerous impacts on the species further out at sea, such as overfishing and climate change, a chorus of campaign groups and environmental NGOs have voiced concern about another human impact closer to our shores \u2013 salmon farms dotted along our Atlantic coast.\nOver the past two months, Noteworthy examined the potential environmental impacts of salmon farming, speaking with scientists, biodiversity experts and environmental groups, as well as combing through hundreds of pages of research and scientific papers.\nWe also sent over 20 Access to Information on the Environment (AIE) and Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to various State bodies to find out what authorities are doing to ensure that rules and regulations are being followed to protect wild species.\nOur findings show that, despite having a rigorous control and regulatory system in place to limit environmental impacts on paper, concerns remain over control of sea lice on farms, lack of data on farm mortalities, no baseline monitoring data on farm escapes, and a lack of control of fishing of sensitive wild wrasse populations for use in the industry.\nIn\u00a0part one, out yesterday,\u00a0we revealed that the National Parks and Wildlife Service has granted licences to salmon farms to cull protected seals along the Atlantic coast.\nIn part three,\u00a0we examine the State\u2019s licensing regime that has allowed salmon farms to operate for over a decade with expired licences, as well as examining overstocking concerns at farms owned by the world\u2019s largest salmon farm company.\nWith a growing global population, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has stressed the role of fish farming, or aquaculture, as an increasingly important source of protein.\nWithin aquaculture, one of the most dominant sectors is Atlantic salmon farming, pioneered in the 1970s in Norway. Global production ramped up rapidly over the following decades,\u00a0tripling between 2000 and 2020 to hit almost 2.7 million tonnes.\nWhile production here pales in comparison to our Scandinavian neighbour \u2013 we brought in 13,400 tonnes last year \u2013 salmon farming is our largest aquaculture sector, worth \u20ac127 million.\nSalmon are kept in large circular pens in sheltered bays along the west coast in counties Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Galway, and Mayo, with several hatcheries to grow juvenile salmon also located inland at freshwater facilities.\nA tourist viewing the picturesque landscape of our Atlantic coast would quickly skip over the sight of the pens, with little to see above water, apart from a few floating wooden walkways and the netted rims of the pens holding the salmon. It is below the surface that the real action happens.\nAs the industry has grown over the decades, a number of stringent licensing and regulatory requirements have been placed on aquaculture for environmental monitoring, fish health, disease control and overall management of the farms.\nLocal groups and environmental groups, however, have raised significant concerns over the monitoring of the industry, as well as concerns over diseases and farm escapes.\nNumerous studies in recent years have examined some of the key concerns raised, with sea lice outbreaks identified as a key concern for both wild salmon and sea trout stocks.\nTo view a searchable version of this table, click here.\nSea lice are saltwater crustaceans, smaller than a fingernail but they pack a punch, especially to juvenile salmon and sea trout when they go to sea. Exposure to sea lice at this stage can cause large scale mortality events and reduce population sizes.\nThis occurred among sea trout between 1989 and 1991 as heavily sea lice-infested wild sea trout in poor physical condition were recorded for the first time in areas with salmon farming. Farms are now confirmed as a\u00a0significant factor in observed stock collapses in western Ireland in the late 1980s.\nJohn Murphy, a keen angler and founder of Salmon Watch Ireland, a campaign group focused on conserving Atlantic salmon numbers, said that the impact of the then-fledgling salmon industry was the catalyst for him to start examining the sector.\n\u201cWhat was happening is the young sea trout were going to sea in aquaculture areas, which was relatively new at the time, and were returning within a number of weeks covered in sea lice and dying of disease in the riverbeds,\u201d he said.\nMurphy is equally concerned about the impact on wild salmon, as are authorities. In a\u00a0submission\u00a0to the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO), the State outlined how sea lice are a key threat to wild salmon that \u201ccould have a significant effect for stocks\u201d.\nAs the salmon are anadromous \u2013 spending part of their lives in both freshwater and the marine environment \u2013 they use the bays containing salmon farms.\nThere has been dispute in recent years about the impact on wild populations, with the Marine Institute confident its studies show that, \u201cwhile sea lice-induced mortality on outwardly migrating smolts can be significant, it is a minor and irregular component\u201d.\nNevertheless, stringent controls are in place to limit any potential impact of lice on salmon farms, with a nationwide monitoring programme introduced in 1993. Under the Sea Lice Monitoring and Control protocol introduced in 2000, 14 annual inspections are now carried out by the Marine Institute, with data publicly available for all farms checked.\nSince a management strategy to improve pest control on Irish salmon farms was introduced in 2008, the Marine Institute told us that there has been a \u201csteady reduction in the infestation levels\u201d.\nIt said that fewer than 10% of inspections now result in the agency sending a notice to treat (NTT) to a farm to take action to reduce their sea lice levels. This compares to 25% in 2008. In 2019, for example, from 210 inspections on 24 sites, 9% showed elevated lice levels.\nTo view a searchable version of this table, click here.\nA Noteworthy analysis of sea lice data, however, shows that there were still over 40 cases of elevated levels of sea lice from the start of 2018 to March 2021.\nThe Marine Institute issued 32 NTTs in relation to these cases, according to data that it released to Noteworthy, including repeated notices for several sites in Kilkieran Bay in Co Galway, as well as Donegal Bay and Mulroy Bay in Co Donegal.\nThe Marine Institute said that \u201cthe issuing of a single NTT is an example of the system in action and recognises the ongoing efforts of the industry to control sea lice levels\u201d.\nThe Marine Institute said that \u201cpeak numbers recorded in recent years are much lower than peak numbers recorded 10 \u2013 15 years ago\u201d. This, it said, reflects the \u201cbetter proactive management observed on farms\u201d.\nJohn Murphy of Salmon Watch Ireland raised concerns about the number of fish tested \u2013 30 fish in a standard cage and 30 fish in a random cage \u2013 something that he argued is not robust enough on large farms that can hold hundreds of thousands of fish.\nMurphy also criticised the fact that the trigger levels for treatment does not take account of the number of salmon on an individual farm at the time of the inspection.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to understand that a farm six times the size will produce six times the amount of sea lice,\u201d he said. The Marine Institute said that the fixed pen \u201cprovides information on sea lice levels over the production cycle\u201d while the random pen \u201censures that sea lice management measures are performed evenly over the entire site\u201d.\nSimilar concerns about the trigger levels were raised to Noteworthy by Paddy Gargan, an Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) scientist who has spent decades researching the impact of sea lice on wild salmon and sea trout.\nGargan said the IFI has repeatedly argued the trigger level has \u201cno relationship\u201d with the number of fish in the farm or the number of farms in a bay. \u201cWe have asked that there should be a total bay cap on the lice number rather than just an arbitrary protocol level regardless of the stocking density.\u201d\nThe State somewhat recognised this issue in a recent submission to NASCO, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, stating that we have a \u201cbroad scale policy\u201d with national rather than site specific lice trigger treatment targets.\nThis, it said, \u201cmay not ensure consistency with the international goals of ensuring 100% of farms have effective sea lice management\u201d.\nA NASCO evaluation report in January 2021 gave Ireland an unsatisfactory rating, in large part due to concerns over our sea lice policy. Despite NASCO\u2019s rating, the State\u2019s latest report sent to the organisation in April 2021 states that it has not revised its plan.\nIn a statement, the Marine Institute said that the system is \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cone of few monitoring programmes carried out independently from the industry\u201d.\nIt said that the management strategy has been \u201csuccessful in embedding the principles of Single Bay Management\u201d where farms in the same bay \u201copenly communicate and coordinate their stocking and treatment plans\u201d.\nThe Department for the Marine said that our sea lice monitoring and control programme has been acknowledged by the EU Commission as \u201crepresenting best practice\u201d.\nGargan\u2019s recent research has shown that, despite the measures put in place over the years, there is still a significant impact on wild salmon and trout populations.\nResearch published\u00a0last year, for example, shows that salmon returns on five rivers on the West coast between 1990 and 2019 dropped by between 19% and 46% in years following high lice levels on nearby salmon farms.\nThe findings build on a 2017 paper by Gargan\u00a0based on 30 years of data from the Erriff river \u2013 a designated EU protected area for Atlantic salmon \u2013 that flows into Killary Harbour in Co Mayo. The study showed the returning run of salmon reduced by about 50% following years when lice levels at salmon farms in the area were high.\nA further study in late 2020 found that sea trout showed \u201creduced growth\u201d when their sea entry in the spring coincided with periods of nearby salmon-farming activity.\nThe paper, Gargan said, clearly showed that salmon farm impacts led to much fewer eggs being deposited by sea trout and \u201cthe population structure [being] completely different than before salmon farming\u201d.\nThe scientific article, he said, is \u201cprobably the classic paper in terms of impact\u201d as the research team had data from the Erriff prior to the establishment of salmon farms in Killary Harbour and for the following 20 years that \u201cclearly showed the impact\u201d.\nThis was particularly true in the spring period when salmon farm harvesting coincides with the passage of young wild salmon and sea trout into the marine environment.\n\u201cThe key to this whole problem is avoiding high lice levels during and after smolts go to sea and we\u2019ve been emphasising that as the key strategy,\u201d Gargan said, adding that this has not happened enough in his opinion.\nIn a report to NASCO in November 2019, for example, the State said that egg-bearing lice levels were above trigger treatment levels in 19% of inspections during the critical spring period in 2017.\nWhile authorised medicines were traditionally used to treat lice, today, farms are increasingly turning to a range of non-medicinal methods. These include freshwater bathing, mechanical control using warm water, and an increasingly popular method \u2013 cleaner fish that eat the lice off the salmon.\nTwo species are used here: lumpfish and wrasse. While lumpfish are cultivated, wrasse are taken from the wild \u2013 and in increasing numbers. Marine Institute data released to Noteworthy shows that almost two million wild wrasse were transferred to salmon farms between 2015 and 2020.\nIn 2018 and 2019 alone, the Marine Institute approved 68 movements of wrasse, totalling over 730,000 fish,\u00a0that it said \u201cclearly demonstrate[s] an increasing use of cleaner fish to control sea lice\u201d.\nThe increasing use of the species has brought concern, however, due to their important role in reef habitats \u2013 most bays where wrasse are caught are in protected nature areas \u2013 and the impact fishing can have on the species.\nThis issue has repeatedly been raised by Galway Bay Against Salmon Cages (GBASC) \u2013 a campaign group against salmon farming on environmental grounds \u2013 that is concerned at State support for the catching of wrasse.\nIn 2016 and 2017, for example, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) \u2013 the agency charged with supporting the development of the seafood industry \u2013 supplied almost 400 wrasse pots, pens and fedbags worth just under \u20ac18,000 to salmon farms free of charge as part of an industry trial, according to details released to GBASC under AIE Regulations and seen by Noteworthy.\nAccording to the group\u2019s chairperson, Billy Smyth, a keen angler involved in campaigns opposing salmon farming since the late 1980s, GBASC is \u201cworried\u201d about large numbers of wild wrasse being taken out of bays \u201cfor the simple reason that wild wrasse are very slow maturing and it takes them years to actually breed\u201d.\n\u201cIf you keep taking out the breeding population of those wrasse every year, you\u2019re possibly causing an extinction vortex in years to come where there\u2019ll be no more wild wrasse left for breeding,\u201d he said, pointing to the lack of any assessments to date on wrasse populations along the west coast.\nTo view an interactive version of this chart, click here.\nThese concerns were recognised by the Marine Institute in a note prepared for its board in November 2020\u00a0that said there \u201cundoubtedly remain legitimate welfare concerns regarding the use of cleaner fish on salmon farms\u201d. These concerns, it said, come on top of \u201cenvironmental concerns with regards to the use of wild caught fish\u201d.\nDepartment of the Marine (DAFM) notes from a January 2021 meeting with the Irish Farmers\u2019 Association and the Marine Institute also state that wrasse are \u201cbiologically vulnerable to overfishing\u201d and that there are \u201cconcerns in relation to overexploitation\u201d.\nThe notes show that the Department identified a \u201cneed to be able to assess the risk of the fishery to both the wrasse and the reef habitat\u201d. Similar recommendations were made in 1996 in an NUI Galway study on intensive wrasse fishing to supply salmon farms.\n\u201cIf exploitation of wild stocks continues, the development of a fishery management strategy is required in order to prevent the over-exploitation of wrasse stocks in areas close to salmon farms, and to ensure that sufficient standing stocks are maintained,\u201d the study recommended.\nHowever, records released from several State bodies show that we know little more now than we did in the mid-1990s. The DAFM meeting notes, for example, state that the only real data the Marine Institute holds are the movement orders and that \u201ccatch data is limited and data gaps need to be addressed\u201d.\nThis lack of data, it said, \u201cmakes it difficult to determine the ecological damage, if any, caused by the fishery to Natura [EU protected nature] sites\u201d.\nOne problem stems from the fact that wrasse are generally caught by smaller inshore vessels not required to record catches in an EU logbook. One way to potentially get around this issue is through details on the fish buyers register that lists all transactions of fish bought directly from vessels.\nThis applies to salmon farms, according to a Fisheries Information Notice (FIN) issued by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) on 9 November 2018. \u201cSalmon farm operators who buy live fish (wrasse or other similar species) for use as \u2018cleaner fish\u2019 in their processes are required to register as a fish buyer before purchasing such fish and then only from legally registered fishing vessels,\u201d it said.\nThe problem was, however, that no salmon farms were registered, as indicated in a response to a Parliamentary Question posed by Deputy Noel Grealish on 6 November 2018.\nInternal SFPA emails released to Noteworthy show that the questions posed by Grealish played a role in the decision to issue the FIN.\nAn internal email chain on 7 November 2018, for example, outlined the potential need for \u201ca compliance push\u201d that lead to the drafting of the FIN on wrasse sales to salmon farms.\nIn a previous internal email chain on 31 October, one staff member working on the request stated in plain terms that there are \u201crelatively simple\u201d answers to Deputy Grealish\u2019s question.\nIt is also apparent from internal records released to us that the SFPA was not aware of the data held by the Marine Institute on wrasse movements to salmon farms at the time.\nIn July 2019, for example, Galway Bay Against Salmon Cages made a complaint to the fisheries authority asking it to investigate the use of wild wrasse on salmon farms.\nIn further correspondence with the SFPA in September 2019, the group sent a copy of data released to it by the Marine Institute via an AIE request that showed over 1.5 million wild wrasse were moved onto salmon farms since 2015.\nThis appears to have spurred the SFPA into action, according to the internal records released to Noteworthy, as on 30 October 2019, the agency\u2019s Director of Enforcement, Gene O\u2019Keeffe, informed its legal team that \u201cwe will need to follow up with a significant investigation with regard to sales system registration and possibly operator licencing\u201d.\nAn email was then sent to all SFPA senior port officers on 11 November 2019\u00a0with\u00a0the Marine Institute data that the email said \u201cindicates the enormity of the numbers of fish that [are] being \u2018sold\u2019 but for which no traceability by way of documents [sic] first sale are available\u201d.\nBy early November 2019, the SFPA had \u201copened an investigation on undocumented fish being exported in Galway\u201d.\nNoteworthy asked the SFPA for an overview of the findings of both its wider investigation and in Galway but the agency did not provide details. Instead, it said that it has engaged with key stakeholders such as the Irish Salmon Producers Group to \u201cencourage fish farming members to sign up as fish buyers for the purposes of verifying purchases of wrasse\u201d.\nMowi \u2013 Ireland\u2019s largest salmon farm operator \u2013 is currently the sole registered buyer from the industry but only since May 2020, according to the SFPA.\nMowi is responsible for around 80% of Ireland\u2019s salmon production and the majority of wrasse movements onto farms went to company sites between 2015 and 2020. This includes movement of almost 1.5 million wrasse prior to its registration in May 2020.\nMowi did not respond to specific questions from\u00a0Noteworthy\u00a0as to why it did not register earlier. Instead, it said that the company has \u201cmade incredible strides\u201d in the development of novel biological sea lice control methods such as with the use of cleaner fish.\n\u201cOur greatest resource is obviously the environment \u2013 which [we] have depended on for our continued success for more than 41 years,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said.\nIn a statement, the SFPA said that, when it became apparent this year that only one significant farm operator had started to input sales notes, \u201cfurther efforts have been made by the SFPA to ensure compliance\u201d. It said that a number of farms are now in the process of registering.\nIt said it has also dropped plans for a logbook system in favour of \u201cincreased direct communication\u201d with vessels catching wrasse and those purchasing it, as well as \u201cphysical inspections which will provide the data necessary for the effective regulatory control\u201d.\nAnother area where conservation groups are concerned is the availability of data related to diseases and mortalities on farms.\nA recent report published by the Marine Institute on recorded diseases by its Fish Health Unit in 2018 and 2019 was the first public report on the unit\u2019s activities, for example.\nWhile salmon farms are deemed as \u201chigh-risk sites\u201d and inspected annually, the report states that there was a high health status in 2018 and 2019 with no evidence of any EU listed diseases.\nThere is no requirement for farms, however, to report mortalities from other causes. This was outlined by the Marine Institute in a reply to an AIE request from GBASC in November 2020 for any reports of farmed salmon mortalities in 2020.\nIt emphasised that there is \u201cno direct regulatory requirement\u201d under EU law to report mortalities from causes not associated with a specific list of notifiable diseases.\nIt said that mortality reports for other diseases are provided \u201cthrough a voluntary reporting scheme\u201d and provided details on these cases.\nBilly Smyth of GBASC, however, said this means some diseases \u201cendemic in Irish salmon farms\u201d may not be notified to the authorities, such as cardiomyopathy disease, pancreas disease and amoebic gill disease, that can have a big impact on salmon populations.\n\u201cThey are highly contagious fish diseases and they should be notifiable diseases because they\u2019re causing serious mortalities,\u201d he said.\nTo view a searchable version of this table, click here.\nFarms have reported large mortality events, as shown in the Marine Institute report, which outlined nine mortality events in 2018 and 20 in 2019.\nIn February 2019, the Marine Institute was also informed of mortalities during the transfer of juvenile salmon from a hatchery to a marine farm. An estimated 60,000 of the 208,000 fish moved died during transport.\nData released to Noteworthy\u00a0also shows further mortality events occurred in 2020, largely attributed to phytoplankton blooms and jellyfish.\nIn some cases, these non-infectious causes co-occurred with non-notifiable diseases such as cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS). CMS is a severe cardiac disease affecting Atlantic salmon, first found in farmed salmon in Ireland in the early 2010s.\nIn one case at a Mowi farm in Inver Bay in Co Donegal, 61% of the stock died as a result of phytoplankton blooms and jellyfish, soon followed by a \u201ccomplete loss of the site within two weeks\u201d of the start of another bloom, according to Marine Institute records.\nA few cases also involved pancreatic disease (PD), a significant infectious disease affecting salmon farming since the mid-1980s.\nAn additional case was identified in Department of the Marine inspection reports that shows over 300,000 unhealthy fish affected by furunculosis were culled at a farm growing fish on a contract basis for Mowi in the autumn of 2020.\nFurunculosis is a highly contagious disease caused by a pathogenic bacteria that can cause boils, lesions, haemorrhages and sudden death.\nThe number of salmon that died in the cases released by the Marine Institute is unknown, however, as it only released the percentage of fish that died from the total amount stocked at the time, details of which were not provided.\nLinked to the issue of farm disease and parasites, sea lice in particular, is concern over the possibility of escapes from farms that can pose threats to the genetic integrity of wild stocks.\nWhile the number of cases here are lower than our European neighbours, largely in part due to the small size of our industry, there have been some large escapes in recent years.\nIn its report to NASCO in 2019, for example, the state said that between 1996 and 2017, 800,000 farmed salmon escaped from marine sites. The number of salmon returning to spawn is Irish rivers is estimated to be\u00a0less than 300,000 per year.\nIn its report to NASCO, the State also said that some escapes go unreported. This issue was documented by Inland Fisheries Ireland\u00a0after anglers reported catching suspected escaped farmed salmon in five rivers in August and September 2017.\n\u201cThis large number of escaped farmed salmon, with a high proportion of males likely to be sexually mature, presents a potential threat to local wild salmon populations,\u201d the IFI said.\nBased on an analysis of reports on known escapes released to Noteworthy by the Marine Institute, the reasons for the escapes were often due to damaged or ripped nets, sometimes caused by storms.\nThe size of the escape is not necessarily an issue, however, according to University College Cork Professor Philip McGinnity, a specialist on the genetic impacts of farm escapes.\nHe explained the impact of an escape into a river such as the Moy, which flows through Sligo and Mayo with a wild salmon breeding population of about 50,000, is likely to be insignificant.\nAn escape of couple of hundred fish into a river system with only 100 or 200 spawners, however, could potentially \u201cin one go, result in the hybridisation of the whole population\u201d.\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s totally, or even substantially hybridised, it\u2019s changed completely. There\u2019s no coming back. Something that might have evolved over a period of 15-20,000 years, is lost forever.\u201d\nThe presence of offspring of farm fish, he explained, including their hybrid offspring \u2013 having both a farm and wild parent \u2013 can have a big impact on a river\u2019s wild salmon productivity.\nA significant change in the genetic makeup, McGinnity said, can lead to \u201ca genetic mismatch\u201d and consequently a mismatch in life-history traits between an affected local population and its environment that are\u00a0important for survival.\nThis he says \u201ccan result in a reduction in reproductive fitness\u201d \u2013 the number of offspring that survive to spawn in future generations \u2013 that, he said, \u201cwill impact on population abundance in the long-term\u201d.\nThe BIM has said\u00a0there is no evidence of any significant impact on wild salmon as a result of escapes from salmon farms, and that the Irish salmon farming industry has the best record on escapes in a recent major European study. The study found that, of 113 Atlantic salmon escapes between 2009 and 2012, only one occurred in Ireland.\nMcGinnity, however, said that, while it is important to have an accurate record of escapes for purposes of attribution and management, the only way to really know if recipient populations are impacted is to assess them genetically,\u00a0given the \u201ccontext specific\u201d nature of the impacts.\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t measured it, you haven\u2019t looked for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\nOther countries are \u201cvery active\u201d in this area, he said, including sampling of fish in farm cages\u00a0in Norway \u201cso that they can attribute an escape to particular farms\u201d. McGinnity said that we have yet to establish a genetic baseline of our salmon populations, however.\nThis step, he said, is required for detailed long-term monitoring for change in wild populations to feed into a detailed risk assessment and management framework.\nMcGinnity said that it would be a good idea to establish a baseline now \u201cwhile the farm production in Ireland is relatively low and before any future expansion\u201d of the industry.\nNASCO\u00a0recently told the State\u00a0that its approach to ensure 100% farmed fish are retained in facilities is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with guidelines for reporting and tracking fish. The NASCO review group considered that Ireland\u2019s actions on containment \u201crequire substantial revision\u201d.\nTo view an interactive version of this chart, click here.\nCritics of the industry argue that these potential marine impacts require resolution sooner rather than later with plans to grow the sector in the National Strategic Aquaculture Plan.\nAccording to Paddy Gargan, Inland Fisheries Ireland want the industry to move to a land-based model that would remove the issues of escapes and sea lice. There are downsides, however, such as an\u00a0 increased emissions footprint.\nJohn Murphy of Salmon Watch Ireland said that, whatever model is used in the future, the State and industry need to \u201cmake sure that they get things right before pushing ahead\u201d.\nWithout changes to the system as it currently operates, he said, there will be environmental problems unless you \u201cbuild a physical wall between the ocean environment and farmed fish\u201d.\n\u201cSalmon are dying of many factors at sea but this is one factor that we can really control and so far this is not happening.\u201d\nIn part three,\u00a0we examine concerns over the State\u2019s licensing regime that has allowed salmon farms to operate for over a decade with expired licences and without environmental assessment in line with EU law.\nIn\u00a0part one, out yesterday,\u00a0we revealed that the National Parks and Wildlife Service has granted licences to salmon farms to cull protected seals along the Atlantic coast.\nThis investigation was carried out by Niall Sargent of Noteworthy.

Many argue that China exports its developmental model and imposes it on other countries. But Chinese players also extend their influence by working through local actors and institutions while adapting and assimilating local and traditional forms, norms, and practices.\nWith a generous multiyear grant from the Ford Foundation, Carnegie has launched an innovative body of research on Chinese engagement strategies in seven regions of the world\u2014Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, the Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Through a mix of research and strategic convening, this project explores these complex dynamics, including the ways Chinese firms are adapting to local labor laws in Latin America, Chinese banks and funds are exploring traditional Islamic financial and credit products in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, and Chinese actors are helping local workers upgrade their skills in Central Asia. These adaptive Chinese strategies that accommodate and work within local realities are mostly ignored by Western policymakers in particular.\nUltimately, the project aims to significantly broaden understanding and debate about China\u2019s role in the world and to generate innovative policy ideas. These could enable local players to better channel Chinese energies to support their societies and economies; provide lessons for Western engagement around the world, especially in developing countries; help China\u2019s own policy community learn from the diversity of Chinese experience; and potentially reduce frictions.\nChinese construction contracts and development finance have increased massively in recent years. According to many experts, these projects are largely transplants designed to offshore and export Chinese technology, labor, and policy designs to host countries. However, these views have little regard for important nuances of place, time, and politics, ignoring the degree to which host countries\u2014such as local elites, members of civil society, and norms\u2014shape project design, implementation, and results on the ground.\nUnder the regime of President Rodrigo Duterte, political elites in the Philippines have pressed Chinese firms to adapt to some of their demands for political expediency on key infrastructure projects. This pattern is evident from the Kaliwa Dam and the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project\u2014both of which\u00a0have made substantial progress during Duterte\u2019s rule. In particular, Manila has bypassed local social and environmental regulations and has paved the way for Chinese dam builders to break ground on projects quickly so as to strengthen the Duterte government\u2019s political standing.\nAround the world, Chinese firms have been highly attentive to the will of local political elites, limiting or sometimes completely avoiding relationships with opposition elites and ties to civil society members. Philippine politics is turbulent. Projects supported by the Duterte regime today might not have the same traction under his successor. So while these Chinese concessions have earned favor with Duterte and his allies, such tactics may prove unsustainable over the long term and could easily spur future resentment against China among local communities marginalized by this decisionmaking. In sum, it is Filipinos, not Chinese actors, who mostly have set the agenda on these major infrastructure projects, except on a few specific contractual terms.\nChinese construction contracts and development financing through the Belt and Road Initiative\u2014particularly from two state-backed policy banks, the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank\u2014have increased around the world in recent years. In 2014, the College of William and Mary\u2019s AidData research institute estimated the total amount of worldwide official Chinese financing from these two policy banks between 2000 and 2014 to be around $351 billion.1 And besides that, other Chinese actors have poured billions more into overseas ventures from the balance sheets of state-owned and private Chinese corporations, which draw from state-run investment funds or the country\u2019s five largest state-owned commercial banks.2\nSome experts argue that the Chinese projects financed by this huge pool of capital are simply transplanting Chinese economic outputs overseas, offshoring or exporting Chinese technology, labor, and policy designs to host countries with little regard for the granular realities of place, time, and local politics.3 However, this perspective ignores the degree to which host countries\u2014particularly local elites, members of civil society, and norms\u2014shape project design, implementation, and results on the ground.\nThe interactions between Chinese lenders and Filipino political elites (especially President Rodrigo Duterte and his allies) offer a compelling test case of whether and how Chinese players adapt to local conditions in host countries for two reasons. First, Duterte\u2019s predecessor, former president Benigno Aquino III, effectively excluded Chinese government-backed financing from any of the country\u2019s public infrastructure projects. Instead, Aquino relied on public-private partnerships (PPPs), which benefited from the surge in global capital markets that allowed Philippine conglomerates to access international capital themselves.4 Aquino heavily shielded these conglomerates from foreign competitors by bidding out infrastructure projects largely through PPP mechanisms. That made the Philippine government a buyer of private services rather than a public builder in its own right. In contrast, the Duterte administration took a more proactive role in infrastructure construction for the country\u2019s public sector while heavily encouraging Chinese partners to get more involved. Second, many of the country\u2019s infrastructure projects financed by Chinese capital are still ongoing. This allows for real-time analysis of how these projects continue to unfold, including the push and pull between various local and foreign players, the bargaining between them, and any prospective adaptations that result.\nTwo major projects in the Philippines that have made substantial progress under Duterte\u2019s watch with the backing of Chinese financing and Chinese project involvement are the Kaliwa Dam and the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project (CRPIP). Both projects are likely to be completed or have made substantial progress by the end of Duterte\u2019s six-year presidential term in 2022. Studying how both projects were implemented, detailing the procedures at different project phases, and examining whose interests won the day (and how) all yield lessons about how local adaptation and negotiations between Filipino elites and Chinese actors have played out.\nChinese firms have adapted to the political demands of the Duterte government on both projects. Specifically, Manila successfully has bypassed local social and environmental regulations to pave the way for Chinese construction companies to break ground on projects so as to strengthen the Duterte government\u2019s political standing. Duterte-backed players have insisted on key contract terms, including restrictions on exporting Chinese labor for the projects and requirements related to construction activities, which the Chinese firms have acceded to. Chinese participants have allowed their Filipino counterparts to choose project parameters and deal with land reclamation, and they have deferred to Filipinos on negotiations with local communities.\nIn many cases around the world, Chinese players have been careful to accommodate the will of the political elites in power when negotiations are underway, while limiting or avoiding relationships with opposition elites and contentious ties to civil society members. In the Philippines, this practice, while reflecting a Chinese willingness to adapt to the local political needs of the Duterte government, is likely to yield longer-term challenges because such tactics have bred resentment against China among many local communities.\nBoth projects have manifested signs of Duterte\u2019s autocratic tendencies, not least through the state\u2019s intimidation of civil society organizations, manipulation of project evaluations, and neglect of the standards by which the Philippine government is supposed to secure the free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) before building on the lands of indigenous communities. FPIC, a concept developed to give indigenous groups the right to decide on construction activities in their ancestral domains, gives Philippine communities including local districts known as barangays the power to refuse to allow any business activities on their lands.5 Chinese firms have contributed, albeit indirectly, to efforts by Filipino ruling elites to quell local social movements. Many Filipinos are likely, as a result, to increasingly regard Chinese firms as irresponsible foreign actors.6 The Social Weather Stations, the Philippines\u2019 premier survey research firm, conducts yearly trust surveys of how average Filipinos view other countries.7\nDespite short-term commercial gains under Duterte, then, political change at the top in the Philippines could mean that Chinese firms will then lose out on future opportunities to build projects that contribute to the country\u2019s development and win greater support from local communities. Put simply, financing and letting the Philippine government expedite these major projects may satisfy China\u2019s immediate interests in the Philippines, but these actions are generating anti-Chinese sentiments that will have adverse long-term consequences. The conclusions in this analysis are based on fieldwork for both dam projects conducted from 2018 to 2020 and site visits to several Philippine provinces that have been affected by both projects.8\nPhilippine elite politics is contentious and unpredictable. Projects supported today might not win the same degree of support tomorrow, as many elites are simply clinging to the shirttails of the government in power at any given moment. As such, any wrongdoing by Chinese firms may harm the progression of these projects and backfire on the local elites who have supported them. To avoid these negative long-term repercussions, the Chinese state and firms should insist on thorough environmental, social, and other impact assessments. Chinese firms could also partner with local agencies to conduct these procedures in ways that strengthen local acceptance.\nThe paper first summarizes Chinese investments in the Philippines during the two administrations that preceded Duterte\u2019s: that of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (2001\u20132010) and Benigno Aquino III (2010\u20132016). It then turns to developments during the Duterte presidency (2016\u2013the present). These sections outline key events, discuss overall trends, and narrate the current state of play concerning Chinese money in the Philippines. Next, the paper briefly examines the key project details of the Kaliwa Dam and the CRPIP. This section discusses the Chinese contractor, the loan conditions, and the current status of each project. Subsequent sections examine both projects, drawing on fieldwork data to analyze adaptations to local elite preferences by the Chinese actors involved, the actions of the host country, and the impact on local communities. The conclusion outlines key recommendations that the Chinese and Philippine governments could follow to better support the Philippines\u2019 long-term development goals.\nThe recent history of Chinese investment in the Philippines goes back to before Duterte\u2019s election, at least to the tenures of his two immediate predecessors. During her administration from 2001 to 2010, Philippine president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo set aside the Philippines\u2019 territorial claims in the South China Sea seeking to strengthen bilateral ties with China. These overtures culminated in about twenty major investments from Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in sectors spanning power to transportation.9 However, the majority of these investments sparked fervent local opposition, not least a bid by Zhongxing New Telecommunications Equipment Corporation (now known as ZTE) to upgrade the broadcasting infrastructure of the Philippine National Broadcasting Network, eventually prompting Arroyo to nix the deal.\nSimilar problems plagued other ventures too. The China National Machinery Industry Corporation, which broke ground on a high-speed rail line, was stymied by an indefinite moratorium in 2008 that halted the project. China\u2019s largest bank, the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, sought to open branches in the Philippines but also ultimately elected not to do so amid political opposition.10 Eighteen Chinese agribusiness projects and a few major mining projects were also scuttled by opposition from multiple Filipino regional and local elites. In the end, only one successful major investment came to fruition: the bid by the State Grid Corporation of China to acquire the National Transmission Corporation of the Philippines as part of a three-party consortium that also included the Monte Oro Grid Resources Corporation and another local player, the Calaca High Power Corporation.\nArroyo\u2019s successor, Aquino, is known for having bitterly confronted China during his term in office, yet he initially began with cordial relations with the Chinese government. Aquino extracted a Chinese commitment to enhance foreign direct investment (FDI) and development finance projects to the tune of $13 billion.11 But after territorial disputes between China and the Philippines over Scarborough Shoal erupted into a 2012 standoff in the South China Sea, Aquino and his team shelved government-to-government transactions. After China imposed sanctions on Philippine fruit exports and limited Chinese tourist inflows, the Philippines took China to an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague, which issued a 2016 decision stating that the maritime territorial claims of Beijing\u2019s nine-dash line have no legal basis. This decision legitimized the Philippines\u2019 economic activities in its exclusive economic zone, which overlaps with China\u2019s claims.12\nThe investment deal involving the State Grid Corporation of China\u2014which gave a Chinese SOE the largest (albeit still a minority) stake in the Philippines\u2019 only electricity grid\u2014was subjected to political attacks and opprobrium from the Aquino government.13 Still, despite the conflictual political relationship, a strong economic relationship between China and the Philippines continued in other ways. Chinese FDI, including FDI from Hong Kong, increased during Aquino\u2019s term due to the Philippines\u2019 booming economic growth, as the country\u2019s gross domestic product climbed by an average of 6.2 percent per year during his tenure and reached a high point of 7.2 percent in 2013.14 Several Chinese SOEs worked with Philippine oligarchs to offer engineering, procurement, and construction services for building two major power projects. The Philippines ultimately became the largest exporter of nickel to China, even at the height of the political tensions associated with the South China Sea disputes.15 Overall, most of these investments involved smaller Chinese investors or firms in the manufacturing, services, tourism, and real estate sectors\u2014not major Chinese SOEs.16\nOnce Duterte ascended to the presidency in 2016, he reversed the Philippines\u2019 stance on the eastern parts of the South China Sea, which Manila refers to as the West Philippine Sea. The driving factor for this reversal was Duterte\u2019s desire to pursue better relations with Beijing and access loans and direct investment from Chinese policy banks and an array of Chinese firms. Duterte and his administration claim to have signed some $24 billion in Chinese commitments of aid and FDI, but this figure must be taken with a grain of salt.17 Duterte\u2019s approach has had many critics, especially among pundits and academics. Such critics have generally thought that even though better relations with Beijing would lead to more Chinese investment in the Philippines, the government would end up kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party. For example, the well-known Philippine analyst Renato De Castro argued that \u201clured by the Belt and Road Initiative, President Rodrigo Duterte is undoing his predecessor\u2019s policy of balancing China\u2019s expansive claim in the disputed waters.\u201d18\nHowever, this popular view misses the deeper story of Chinese investment during the Duterte years. For one thing, there have been many other negotiators apart from Duterte and Chinese state officials, including over 200 Philippine businesspeople and their staff members, as well as local and China-based representatives of Chinese SOEs, private firms, and Chinese government ministries.19 Political brokers from both countries who do not belong to either the Chinese or Philippine governments have attended negotiations on such agreements. These actors have negotiated FDI deals for themselves outside the framework of direct negotiations with the Duterte administration: they have sought engineering, procurement, and construction contracts; service-related projects; and supplier deals.\nThese actors have often misled one another. For instance, touting their connections to their home ministries in Beijing, some Chinese firms have promised Filipino elites that they could quickly bring funding to the Philippines. Similarly, several Filipino business elites have promised Chinese firms and officials that their access to the Duterte team could alleviate bureaucratic constraints in Manila. In many cases, memoranda of understanding (MOUs) have been hastily signed without proper due diligence.\nDuterte and his elites have also done a good deal of \u201ccredit claiming,\u201d seeking to generate political capital by claiming credit for projects or investments that they themselves had little, if anything, to do with.20 This has included announcements by Duterte allies publicizing the signing of MOUs, the first step in agreements, as if they were actualized Chinese investments. After Duterte\u2019s China trip in 2016, Duterte\u2019s allies touted the \u201chuge\u201d success of his Beijing visit, making it appear as if Duterte had attained an impressive haul of new economic agreements, financing, and jobs for Filipinos.21\nThis trend of credit claiming is quite common to the Duterte administration across the board, particularly in its war on drugs and, most recently, its response to the coronavirus pandemic. A high-level official in the Department of Trade and Industry told the author that, during the Arroyo and Aquino administrations, \u201cthe Philippine president would only appear for the MOUs when deals were worth more than a substantial amount of money. Now it seems like the president will appear for a deal valued at as little as $10 million.\u201d22\nYet even though these publicity stunts can be misleading, the increase in Chinese investment that Duterte has claimed is not all smoke and mirrors. There has indeed been a major surge of Chinese capital in the Philippines during his term. Table 1 details the completed, delayed, and ongoing projects during the Duterte administration.23\nDuterte\u2019s desire to bolster FDI is not especially difficult to understand once placed in a broader context. From 2010 to 2016, the Philippines, despite its booming economy, still had some of the lowest levels of Chinese investment in Southeast Asia.33 The State Grid Corporation of China\u2019s 40 percent stake in the country\u2019s national electrical grid (dating from 2009) remains the largest Chinese investment and/or operational partnership in the Philippines.34 This deal has resulted in some technical upgrading to the national grid: since 2011, the joint Chinese-Philippine consortium has begun upgrading the electricity grids across the country and has increased its construction and transmission activities since the beginning of the Duterte administration.35\nBefore Duterte, (apart from the electrical grid deal) leading Chinese SOEs and private firms had long made no major capital investment in the Philippines; instead, nearly all Chinese FDI went into thousands of small firms in wholesale retail, business activities, and services.36 This has changed on Duterte\u2019s watch: in addition to the major power grid deal, China Telecom\u2019s recently approved investment under Duterte is among the largest Chinese efforts thus far, and around 100 or more Chinese online gambling firms (which are registered as non-Chinese companies) are also among the country\u2019s largest foreign investors.37 More recently, some Chinese firms, facing rising labor costs in China, have started examining the prospect of relocating manufacturing plants to Luzon and Mindanao or building industrial parks there.\nThere is no simple way to capture the scope and scale of Chinese FDI in the Philippines because different datasets offer multiple and sometimes competing stories. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce calculated Chinese FDI in the country at $712 million at the end of 2015, but the Philippines\u2019 Central Bank places FDI stock from China and Hong Kong at $821 million at the end of Arroyo\u2019s term in 2010, about $1.2 billion at the close of Aquino\u2019s in 2016, and $1.6 billion during the first four years of the Duterte administration.38\nThe practice of using both FDI stock and flows\u2014and sometimes conflating them\u2014in these datasets presents analytical problems.39 That is why the author and a collaborator created their own unique dataset on the annual number of new firms with Chinese investors. They found 2,785 new firms under Arroyo, 3,647 under Aquino, and 2,767 in just the first two years of Duterte\u2019s term. 40 Chinese online gambling firms, which surged in number in the Philippines during the Duterte administration, do not appear in the data, as many of these firms use offshore financial centers or foreign countries for registration or domiciling.41 Nonetheless, the huge increase of Chinese firms active in the country during the Duterte administration signals the greater role that Chinese money and \u201cflexible capital\u201d has come to play in the Philippines\u2019 economy and business environment.42\nIn the Philippines, the efforts of the Duterte government and associated elites to expedite the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP demonstrates how local elites can help foreign players bypass social, environmental, and regulatory provisions for parochial political objectives. In this way, Chinese players are fueling social dislocation and mass disruption. These Chinese actors are doing so not so much because they are exporting a putative China model but because they are responding to demand-side signals from local players and elites who are in conflict with others in host countries like the Philippines.\nNeither the Kaliwa Dam project nor the CRPIP were conceived of by Chinese investors; rather, these projects were proposed by Filipinos themselves during the rule of former president Ferdinand Marcos (1965\u20131986). At the time, Philippine relations with China were complicated, and Manila was a close strategic and political ally of the United States. In 1976, the World Bank designed the Kaliwa Dam to increase the water supply of the National Capital Region around Manila and its adjacent provinces. World Bank managers and engineers completed a project appraisal, economic evaluation, and other detailed procedures. However, just as the Marcos regime was about to launch the project, elite and social mobilization cascaded into the People Power movement, removing the dictator from power. Several subsequent presidents including Corazon Aquino (1986\u20131992), Fidel V. Ramos (1992\u20131998), Joseph Estrada (1998\u20132001), and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo all wanted to restart the project, but domestic politics and institutional reforms in the Philippines prevented them from doing so.\nOnce Corazon Aquino\u2019s son, Benigno Aquino III, took office in 2010, he began to make some progress on the project. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), a government agency in charge of water distribution and infrastructure construction, placed the Kaliwa Dam under the Aquino administration\u2019s PPP-focused build-operate-transfer scheme.43\nBut by this time, the CRPIP had become a different type of project from the one that Marcos had initially tried to implement, which had been one of the most controversial projects of its time. During the Marcos presidency, the National Corporation of the Philippines (a now-defunct government-owned enterprise) conducted a study of the hydropower potential of the Chico River, which is connected to three tributaries in Luzon.44 Lahmeyer International, a German engineering firm, submitted a feasibility study of the river\u2019s hydropower potential. Specifically, Lahmeyer proposed that four dams be built on the territories of the Kalinga and Bontoc, two major indigenous groups in northern Luzon.45\nThe Marcos regime sought help from the World Bank to finance the project. The indigenous groups in the area, who opposed the scheme, mobilized against it. Initially, they appealed to the Marcos government to reverse its decision. When government officials refused to heed their pleas, these groups responded with intense social mobilization over many years, engaging in protests, road blockades, and economic sabotage on the Philippine and German firms.46 In response, Marcos sent in troops and arrested protesters en masse without warrants. This only made the situation worse when an indigenous group leader was killed in 1980, resulting in even greater social mobilization and leading the World Bank and Marcos himself to accede to their demands. Thereafter, no Philippine president tried to revive the CRPIP for some time, and some even sought to further accommodate the needs of the Kalinga population. Aquino III, for instance, acquired a $9.2 million World Bank loan to rehabilitate an irrigation system for the Kalinga,47 although he eventually pulled the plug on the irrigation system after problems of negligence by a Philippine construction company.48 At the end of Aquino III\u2019s term, his economic team envisioned another project on the Chico River instead.49\nIn mid-2016, the newly inaugurated Duterte announced the Build! Build! Build! Program, aimed at increasing the role of foreign loans and aid in the Philippines\u2019 infrastructure buildout.50 Duterte canceled the Aquino-era PPP-centered build-operate-transfer scheme for the Kaliwa Dam and then placed the project under a foreign loans scheme. In this way, Duterte, not China, was the driver of this big new Chinese capital investment. Duterte and his team simply took the earlier studies and plans finished under Aquino III and then submitted them to China as a high-priority project for bilateral investment.\nThe CRPIP, meanwhile, is a newer project that aims to have a smaller type of dam in the area for irrigation purposes. Although this project was not simply passed over to Duterte from previous administrations, it still reflects the spirit of earlier Philippine initiatives: specifically, the CRPIP is not intended to benefit the local Kalinga population and instead simply transfers the stored water to other parts of Luzon, making the project a comparable successor to the defunct Chico River Dam project of the Marcos years.\nDuterte\u2019s economic managers repackaged these old ideas and then in early 2017 proposed both the Kaliwa Dam and the CRPIP to China, as two of the three key projects for Chinese investment in the Philippines.51 A financing deal for both projects followed and was signed by the end of the year. In 2018, during a state visit to the Philippines by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two sides signed loan agreements worth $211 million and $62 million for the two projects, respectively.52 The Export-Import Bank of China provided loans for both projects.53 Chinese firms are in charge of construction, and the MWSS and the National Irrigation Authority (NIA) have handled other aspects of project implementation (see table 2).54\nThe Kaliwa Dam is in Quezon Province in the middle of the General Nakar and Infanta municipalities. A sixty-meter-tall dam spread over 113 hectares, the Kaliwa Dam is supposed to hold 57 million cubic meters of water and to increase the water supply sent to the National Capital Region and its adjacent provinces.55 These provinces currently draw their water from the Angat Dam, which has experienced consistent resource shortfalls in the last decade.56 With the help of the MWSS, the China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited or Energy China, a major SOE located in Beijing and one of the big firms under the State Council\u2019s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, is in charge of the construction of the Kaliwa Dam.\nThe CRPIP is designed to provide water to 7,530 hectares of agricultural land in the municipalities of Tuao and Piat, located in Cagayan Province, and another 1,170 hectares in the municipality of Pinukpuk in Kalinga Province.57 This project includes the \u201cconstruction of a pump house, sub-station, transmission line, diversion main canal, lateral canals, appurtenant structures, service/access road, and terminal facilities for Chico River PIP.\u201d58 The China CAMC Engineering Company Limited\u2014which is affiliated with Sinomach, another major SOE that previously worked on the Philippines\u2019 North Rail project\u2014is working with the NIA to build the pump.\nChinese firms and Philippine government agencies have subdivided the work and have expedited both these project proposals. The crucial player has been the Duterte administration, whose political needs and impulses have led it to expedite construction, brush aside regulations, and facilitate the necessary procedures for both projects, while strong-arming other government agencies and local communities to follow suit or bypassing them.\nChinese firms have allowed the Duterte administration to act this way to safeguard their investments, looking the other way as Duterte has violated the Philippine public\u2019s FPIC rights. The Duterte administration has moved to ensure that only superficial environmental impact assessments are conducted and even has militarized the areas around both project sites.\nThese practices are not exclusive only to projects involving Chinese lending in the Philippines. However, one local rule of thumb is that such efforts by national Philippine government officials happen whenever powerful Filipino officials and other elites have a political interest in expediting projects at the expense of conducting dialogues and working with communities. These practices often emerge in key private sector projects in the natural resources and mining sectors and have resulted in arrests and alleged threats of members of local communities.59\nIn this sense, Chinese firms have been both adapting to and accommodating local political norms. This Chinese tendency to accommodate one set of local elites has, in this instance, indirectly contributed to the arrests and alleged threats that the Duterte administration has meted out on local communities. Philippine politics, however, can shift markedly from election cycle to election cycle. When new elites come to power in the country\u2019s next election, Chinese commercial and political interests will presumably be impacted too.\nWhen financing for infrastructure projects is sought, actors in host countries often get to select which specific projects win financial backing. However, there are situations when Chinese and host country firms work together to present a project to China\u2019s two major policy banks for financing.\nFor example, such a situation arose involving a partnership between the Philippines\u2019 flagship state media outlet (NBN) and the Chinese firm ZTE, when Benjamin Abalos, a former mayor and supporter of Arroyo, worked with ZTE to acquire financing from the Export-Import Bank of China.60 Such cases raise another question: why do such partnerships form in the first place when certain projects are prioritized for Chinese financing over others?\nIf the Duterte government had simply wanted financing, China was by no means the only available option. After all, Japanese firms and lenders, such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, were apparently willing to fund these ventures. That said, seeking Chinese support instead even though such alternatives were available does not necessarily mean that Duterte was simply a \u201cpuppet\u201d of China either, as many in the Philippines now argue.61 If he was, then it is difficult to understand why the number of Chinese projects remains relatively low in the Philippines today.62 In fact, between 2016 and 2020, even under the watch of supposedly China-friendly Duterte, it is Japan (not China) that still funds more than half the country\u2019s infrastructure projects.63 During Duterte\u2019s tenure, loans from the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Asian Development Bank have accounted for more than half of the Philippines\u2019 loans since October 2016.64 Despite the domestic criticism that Duterte is Beijing\u2019s \u201cpuppet,\u201d he has not steered many projects directly to China.\nThat is why the cases of the Kaliwa Dam and the CRPIP are so interesting. It is true that these projects are being built with Chinese financing, but it was Duterte who repackaged ideas that predated him by several Philippine administrations and pushed the gas pedal to the floor. Multiple Philippine interests, not simply Duterte\u2019s desire for better relations with Beijing, have shaped both projects. Apart from the immediate need to address growing water shortages in and around Manila, technocrats within the Philippine government have been motivated to secure as many concessional loans from as many sources as possible before the country graduates into upper-middle income status.65 Once the Philippines advances into this income group, most concessional loans and financing terms will no longer be available.66\nThere are plenty of other players with interests in backing the dams too. For instance, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which has been waging a decades-long counterinsurgency campaign against the rebel New People\u2019s Army (NPA)\u2014the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines\u2014stands to gain from the construction of the Kaliwa Dam, which will allow it to expand its military presence in the Sierra Madre mountain range, where numerous NPA units continue to operate.67 The appointment of former Philippine Army generals to head the MWSS reveals how the linkages and strategic interests of the country\u2019s armed forces have been embedded into the dam project\u2019s implementation. This also explains the early establishment of military checkpoints and stations at the access points to the dam site, even before the project\u2019s loan agreement was signed in 2018.68 Supporting the Philippine military\u2019s long-standing campaign against the NPA has enabled the Duterte administration to align the military\u2019s interest with the dam and solidify military support for his rule.\nMany other nationally influential Philippine political elites have benefited too\u2014not least, those who operate in the region surrounding the Kaliwa Dam, such as the Angara family of Aurora Province,69 whose local power base has been threatened by the NPA. Especially through their command of key positions in local government and both houses of the national legislature, such elites have substantial influence in helping decide how, where, and when to use military forces in a given area. Such influence allows these dominant local elites to suppress rival elites and non-elite challengers to their political primacy. Often, these elites use nongovernmental paramilitary units to patrol the areas they dominate. Expanding the military\u2019s jurisdiction, as in the cases of the China-invested dam projects, gives them additional security in the face of local threats to their dominance. This purely local political logic has had little to do with the fact the project\u2019s foreign investors are Chinese.\nThe story of the CRPIP is even more complicated in terms of domestic politics. Kalinga Province is located in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), which encompasses the lands of multiple indigenous groups across the country. The Kalinga group makes up the majority of the population in the province that bears its name.70 Crucially, the Chico River connects Mountain Province, another provincial district within the CAR, to Cagayan Province. Kalinga and Apayao also stand between Mountain Province and Cagayan, making this area an ideal location to divert water to different provinces for irrigation purposes.71\nThe indigenous people of Kalinga and Apayao have long demanded enhanced irrigation for their rice production.72 And although they did resist the building of the hydropower dam, the Kalingas nonetheless supported some irrigation projects to increase their domestic rice yield. During her presidential term, Arroyo leveraged Chinese loans to expand the irrigation in the area; Aquino chose instead to lean on World Bank loans, but these were later canceled due to the negligence of a local Filipino contractor.73 The Kalinga-supported irrigation projects were far smaller in scale and cheaper than the CRPIP.\nManila\u2019s choice to pursue the CRPIP at scale boils down to a desire to increase the water supply to key elite landholdings in Cagayan Province. In the words of a political broker who worked with the Duterte government in 2016, the CRPIP was \u201cproposed to the Chinese, but the idea [given to them] was already modified at that time to provide irrigation to local fields where elites grow bananas, coconuts, and other fruits to be exported to China. Water from the Chico Pump would benefit the lowland Filipino landlords and the Filipino farm holders.\u201d74 In other words, the resources of the Kalingas, one of the most oppressed minorities in the Philippines, were being siphoned off to support the interests of the people in power both locally and in Manila instead.\nJoanna Cari\u00f1o\u2014a co-founder of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance, a federation of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for indigenous rights in the CAR\u2014has argued that \u201cthis is another case of the highland population, the minorities and indigenous groups, suffering because of the [parochial political interests of the] majority, and those in power [in the Philippines].\u201d According to Cari\u00f1o, \u201cthe indigenous peoples are the least prioritized when it comes to government funding and [developmental] priorities, yet the project will be built on these indigenous peoples\u2019 land in order to benefit not them but the majority.\u201d75\nLocal political elites in this district are very powerful nationally: Manuel Mamba, the current governor of Cagayan Province, is a member of PDP-Laban, Duterte\u2019s party. The Enrile family, the other major political players in Cagayan, are equally influential. The clan was built by Juan Ponce Enrile, a former Marcos acolyte who broke with him in 1986 and became a national political player. His family still has supporters serving as mayors and local leaders.76 Katrina Enrile, Juan Ponce\u2019s daughter, is the chief executive officer of JAKA Investments Corporation, the parent company of Pacific Royal Basic Foods Inc., a nationally significant coconut producer and exporter.77 In an interview, a local political broker indicated to the author that \u201cboth families had representatives who modified the irrigation pump project from something that had been originally intended for the Kalinga to something bigger and a project that ultimately benefits the landed interests of Cagayan.\u201d78\nSimilarly, the Kaliwa Dam direct benefits an array of nationally influential political elites, so embracing the dam\u2014and then enlisting Chinese financing for it\u2014effectively tied the interests of these elites to the Duterte administration. This approach has given the Duterte team additional leverage over these local elites for future elections, including an expected campaign for the country\u2019s top office by the current president\u2019s daughter, Sara Duterte, in the upcoming 2022 elections.\nAs for the spring of 2021, the dam is being expedited by the Chinese contractor with the help of Duterte administration officials and the coercive apparatus his government controls. And the dam is almost certain to proceed more quickly than it would have if Duterte had instead enlisted, say, a Japanese funder. Going with a Japanese partner would have led to greater scrutiny from international NGOs or other organizations, delaying the dam\u2019s completion and harming the political interests of Duterte himself, his daughter, the military, and an array of local elites and landed interests. The Asian Development Bank, the Japanese International Development Agency, and the Japan Bank for Infrastructure Cooperation have mechanisms that allow civil society organizations and NGOs to file appeals on projects when social abuses or environmental issues arise.79\nSimilarly, the CRPIP funnels water from the Chico River to Cagayan Province, so the project can be expected to increase provincial elite support for Duterte and the PDP-Laban, especially from the highly influential Enrile family. In this case, too, a Japanese-funded project would have subjected the CRPIP to certain rules, such as the World Bank\u2019s directives on indigenous population groups, which Tokyo follows but Beijing does not. Choosing Japan would have limited the enticing opportunity for Duterte to acquire greater local political support by leveraging the CRPIP.\nImportant trends in how Chinese lenders negotiate deals with host countries are also highly evident in major lending projects in the Philippines. AidData\u2019s recently published study, How China Lends, analyzed the particulars of over 100 Chinese debt contracts.80 The authors find that China is a \u201cmuscular and commercially-savvy lender to developing countries. Chinese contracts contain more elaborate repayment safeguards than their peers in the official credit market, alongside elements that give Chinese lenders an advantage over other creditors.\u201d81 The authors argue that Chinese contracts focus on how to expand influence over host countries through project nondisclosure agreements, exclusion from Paris Club debt restructuring, expedited project repayment, and immediate termination clauses.\nThe focus of Chinese financiers on these key clauses has been evident in the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP in several ways.82 First, nondisclosure clauses prevent the Philippine government from revealing the terms of the projects to other foreign lenders, private actors, or even the Philippine people at least for a period of time.83 According to the AidData analysis, such clauses effectively prevent civil society actors or foreign lenders from forming strategies to match Chinese lending terms or to help the host country restructure such debt.84\nYet such clauses have an additional function: they increase the exclusivity of an investment partnership to those who have forged it, excluding competing political elites and civil society leaders from the process. Chinese firms have often worked exclusively with the regime in power at a given time in host countries, concentrating Chinese investments through channels largely overseen by such leaders. This practice harkens back to China\u2019s purported pledge of noninterference in the domestic affairs of host countries, which entails limiting Chinese actors\u2019 relationships with opposition political parties and civil society actors.\nIn the Philippines, for instance, ZTE worked with Abalos at the expense of Jose de Venecia Junior, who served as speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives for two stretches in the 1990s and early 2000s.85 The North Rail railway project was a partnership between a Chinese firm and Arroyo-linked elites, excluding NGOs and other elites from the land reclamation process and other important procedures. In fairness, this tendency is not limited to the Philippines. For instance, under Indonesian President Joko Widodo\u2019s tenure (2014\u2013present), another Chinese firm worked with Indonesian state-owned enterprises to build the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway. In that instance, Indonesian conglomerates were excluded from the process.\nThis insight goes hand-in-hand with a second demand of the Philippines\u2019 Chinese financiers: excluding the dam projects from the terms of the Paris Club.86 This agreement among Japan, the United States, and twenty other major donor countries is designed to help donors coordinate and find solutions to help debtor countries deal with project debt.87 In addition to its member states, the Paris Club has granted observer status to multiple key international financial organizations and multilateral development banks, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank. Though transparency issues remain, Paris Club meetings are open to representatives of NGOs. Philippine debt owed Paris Club members are covered by these agreements.\nIn contrast, if and when issues of debt or distress emerge concerning Beijing\u2019s loans, the Chinese government\u2019s preferred solution has been bilateral debt restructurings with the debtor country in question. Debt restructuring is still possible for both the CRPIP and the Kaliwa Dam project. However, the entire purpose of the Paris Club is to prevent imbalances of power between a lender and a borrower through a set of collectively negotiated rules that enable sustainable debt repayments. The Paris Club also allows civil society actors to participate, ensuring the representation of different stakeholders, at least on paper. These clauses, therefore, exclude several party actors who may otherwise assist the Philippines if debt-related disputes occur or if civil society actors are derailed from mobilizing effectively.\nMoreover, what are termed cross-default clauses allow the Chinese government to collect immediate payments on the entire loan balance if payments on other Chinese projects do not materialize or if the Philippines defaults on its other lenders.88 In the event of a default, Philippine commentators have misinterpreted the potential risk of seizures of Philippine assets by Chinese lenders in an extreme way. Opposition politicians, particular the country\u2019s former chief justice, has read this specific type of clause as a potential way for China to lay claim to the reed bank in the West Philippine Sea.89 Notwithstanding their intentions, these critics\u2019 reading of the situation does not have any empirical basis, and there has not yet been a single case of China making claims in territorial disputes due to debt repayment issues. In the 2021 AidData study, all the examined commercial contracts, about half the bilateral official debt contracts, and a tenth of the multilateral debt contracts in the study\u2019s sample have cross-default clauses.90\nCollectively, these kinds of clauses indicate that the Chinese government has a strong interest in expanding its projects in the Philippines and protecting these projects\u2019 commercial viability. This is probably one of the few areas where the Duterte administration was not able to simply bend Chinese players to its political will. Indeed, a Philippine official from the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) involved in the negotiations told the author, \u201cthe negotiators from the Export-Import Bank of China wanted these clauses more than anything.\u201d This turned out to be the case so much so, in fact, that they gave in to the Duterte team\u2019s other demands to secure these terms. This official noted, for example, that the Chinese policy lender \u201ceven agreed to decrease the interest payments for both projects [Kaliwa and the CRPIP] from 2.5 to 2 percent.\u201d91\nDuterte\u2019s side got its own preferred clauses into the agreement in the bargain, including an insistence on building the project quickly and on a rapid operational timeline. This official noted that \u201cthough the idea of the project started in 2016, we were only able to start it at the end of 2018 after Xi Jinping\u2019s visit. But during the negotiations, we asked if they could finish it early or have major portions constructed since President Duterte\u2019s term will end in 2022. They said no problem.\u201d92\nNotably, neither the CRPIP nor the Kaliwa Dam project required Philippine officials to use special escrow bank accounts to ward off repayment risks, a practice that Chinese lenders use more commonly than most of their peers.93 The Chinese policy banks sometimes use this model of lending with liens or escrow accounts to \u201cmaximize their repayment prospects.\u201d94 In the AidData sample, 75 percent of Chinese Development Bank (six out of eight) and 22 percent of Export-Import Bank of China loans contain such clauses.95 So far, there has not been a single case worldwide in which funds from one of these bank accounts on a Chinese-financed project have been seized.\nThese negotiations between Chinese and Philippine actors were defined by mutual accommodations and concessions on various points. The nondisclosure agreements reveal the compromise between both governments. Using the findings of the aforementioned AidData study, Philippine journalists Ian Cigaral and Prinz Magtulis published a criticism of the Kaliwa Dam and CRPIP. In response, the Philippine Department of Finance issued a scathing rebuttal, arguing that the journalists \u201cpropounded several inaccuracies and falsehoods in connection with Chinese-funded projects in the Philippines.\u201d96 While the nondisclosure agreements were included in both projects, the Department of Finance pointed out that the contracts can be made public if \u201crequired by applicable Philippine laws, regulations, and rules, or by order of any courts, tribunals, or agencies of competent jurisdiction, or relevant bodies.\u201d Cigaral and Magtulis argue that the department only divulged the contracts after lawmakers and members of civil society demanded transparency, while department officials claim to have \u201cwasted no time\u201d in making the contracts available to the public.\nCertain aspects of this disagreement over the nondisclosure clauses are complicated. Opposition politicians and civil society organizations have been concerned about the \u201conerous\u201d provisions of the Kaliwa Dam agreement, filing freedom of information requests and taking matters to the Supreme Court.97 The Department of Finance publicized both contracts on March 18, 2019.98 On this point, the department cannot deny that the pressure to release both contracts was escalating as early as February, indicating that the Philippine government waited before acting.99 It also cannot be denied that the Duterte government was able to modify the Chinese nondisclosure agreements, asserting that both contracts could be divulged under certain conditions. This is also an example of Chinese actors adapting to the local political conditions of the host country rather than fully imposing its will.\nHowever, it is also true that the nondisclosure agreements created transparency issues and protected the Chinese projects. The Department of Finance only publicized the contracts in March, but the Philippine government presented both projects to the Chinese lenders in January 2017.100 Local officials in Cagayan celebrated the CRPIP, and the Philippines\u2019 PPP announced a change in the Kaliwa Dam\u2019s mode of financing.101 At the end of 2017, China and the Philippines publicized a joint statement, agreeing to undertake both projects (among other political and commercial ventures). Presumably, this joint statement, which was issued a year before Xi signed the contracts, was the starting point of negotiations for both projects.102 After Xi signed the deals in November 2018, it took the Department of Finance four more months to release the contracts in March 2019. In other words, the negotiating process and the contracts were not transparent throughout the whole process, and the public was kept in the dark until public pressure made the government act.103\nTo cite another contested point in the negotiations, the Chinese government wanted to increase the share of Chinese laborers on both projects. On the Philippine side, NEDA officials tried to dissuade them from insisting on this condition and sought to limit the number of Chinese workers. Another NEDA official noted in the interview, for instance, that, \u201cwe knew this would be an important point since those domestic interests arrayed against the Duterte government would make an issue out of it. And so, we were able to increase Philippine labor participation as much as possible.\u201d104\nThe Chinese side, meanwhile, got more of its way on wage rates for Chinese workers. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make them budge on wages,\u201d recalled a Philippine Department of Finance official.105 An interview with an Export-Import Bank of China representative confirmed that \u201cwhen we negotiated with the Philippine government, we had some [binding] parameters but were willing to make concessions. But one of the things we couldn\u2019t budge on was wages for the Chinese. How could we make them [the Chinese] go to the Philippines if we didn\u2019t increase their wages?\u201d106\nNor were the Chinese firms made responsible for social amelioration, land reclamation, and environmental impact assessments, tasks that fell to the Philippine government under the agreement. The same Export-Import Bank of China representative argued that this was merely a function of \u201crespecting Philippine and each country\u2019s laws. We cannot impose conditions, unlike Western and other government lenders. Besides, the cost would have increased if we had to do this, nor do we know how to do it\u201d in the Philippine context.107\nIn another interview, a Philippine Central Bank official noted that one of the key differences between the Kaliwa Dam and CRPIP contracts involved the parameters for the interest payments. Unlike the CRPIP, the dam can receive profits from its operations in the form of payments to the Chinese government, thanks to a clause that the Philippine government successfully negotiated in exchange for accommodating the secrecy and other clauses demanded by the Chinese policy bank.108\nThrough the MWSS, the Kaliwa Dam has a captive market, which can yield money for both loan principal and interest payments. Philippine cities suffer from yearly water shortages during the summer or when droughts occur.109 This is why the Philippine government has launched an infrastructure plan to increase the number of dams in the country under a hybrid scheme involving overseas development aid and PPPs.110 State agencies and private firms handle water distribution in the country, particularly Maynilad and Manila Water\u2014two private firms that dominate metropolitan Manila.111 The MWSS handles the relevant regulations. The market is a captive one because the MWSS also sets the price of water for metropolitan Manila.112 In this case, the Kaliwa Dam will be providing water to a domestic market characterized by high demand. Profits are expected to be initially used to pay back the Chinese loan. The Chinese counterparties involved understood this and agreed to give this flexibility to the Philippine government.\nMeanwhile, counterintuitively, keeping interest rates low was not important to the Philippine government. Both the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP had interest rates of 2 percent, which are slightly higher than those that must be paid to Japanese lenders but far lower than what commercial bank lenders have demanded from the Philippines.113 As a Philippine Department of Defense interviewee pointed out, \u201cThe payment scheme for both Chinese-financed projects will last for twenty years across multiple Philippine administrations but the construction period would mostly happen now during Duterte\u2019s term.\u201d114 The Duterte government cared more about meeting the president\u2019s own political needs on the projects\u2019 timeline and was willing to accept a higher interest rate as part of the bargain. Duterte and his negotiators made concessions on the financing terms to secure their preferred operational timeline. Reportedly, the timing was a higher political and domestic priority for Duterte himself, \u201cwho wanted both projects to be the legacy of his Build! Build! Build! Initiative. And paying the higher interest rates over a long period would not, ultimately, be his administration\u2019s problem.\u201d115\nEchoing this same sentiment, the NEDA development assistance analyst who was interviewed noted that acquiring Chinese funding served Duterte\u2019s needs even at a higher interest rate since it increased the overall number of infrastructure projects in the Philippines. She pointed out that \u201cJapan is still the largest development financier in the Philippines. And so, paying a percent or two more to China was an acceptable exchange for [the higher priority] of increasing the project stock\u201d in the country during Duterte\u2019s term.116 A related priority for Duterte\u2019s negotiators was to keep an eye on interest rates for a larger number of parallel Japanese-financed projects in the Philippines. Instead of working with the Japanese on the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP, Duterte\u2019s government was able to offer to work with Japanese lenders on other projects instead.\nIn fact, a Japanese firm offered alternative proposals to counter the Chinese offers to fund the Kaliwa Dam and the CRPIP. In 2016, the Osaka-based infrastructure developer called the Global Utility Development Corporation submitted an unsolicited proposal to NEDA officials,117 which was delayed and then ignored. For the CRPIP project, the Asian Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the country\u2019s foreign aid agency, were willing to fund a similar project, but Duterte\u2019s team passed on the offer.118 When asked why the government pursued the Chinese option instead of the Japanese offers, the Philippine Department of Defense interviewee said, \u201cThis was purely political. The Chinese were willing to build the projects quickly during President Duterte\u2019s term. If the Philippines had done this with the Japanese or the [Asian Development Bank], there would have been stricter procedures, which would have delayed it. Bureaucrats wanted the Japanese but Malaca\u00f1ang Palace wanted the Chinese. Even if the Chinese do not finish the projects [before the end of Duterte\u2019s term], they would likely be done with major portions. President Duterte can still claim credit.\u201d119\nChinese firms have been in charge of construction on these two projects, but Philippine government officials have taken on the burden of acquiring consent from affected residents, reclaiming the needed land, and conducting environmental impact assessments. The Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the NIA, and the MWSS expedited all the necessary procedures. These various agencies worked with the Chinese partners to immediately demarcate the land for the projects, build bunk houses for the Chinese workers, and take on other operational tasks.120 These Philippine agencies, with the blessing of Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, initially bypassed the provincial and regional governments.121 Affected communities were not consulted either. As Cari\u00f1o of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance explained, \u201cWe did not even see the plans for the Chico River Pump. We just had a workshop and there was a faculty member of University of Cordilerras who became a consultant for [the] NIA and presented the plan.\u201d122\nPhilippine government officials claimed they acquired FPIC from the affected residents. After supposedly following the procedure (when it seems as though they bypassed it), the Philippine government needed to acquire the relevant lands by purchasing titled land or appropriating untitled plots. In the case of the CRPIP, a fair amount of land was purchased from inhabitants of Kalinga Province. Farmers and landowners were, however, apparently pressured to sell for cheap, with government officials reportedly threatening those who were unwilling to sell or wanted to negotiate a higher price.123\nIn some cases, the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the NIA, and the MWSS also forcibly acquired indigenous lands recognized under customary land use, including tracts that are registered as ancestral lands under the Philippines\u2019 National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). Crucially, the Philippine government mandates that indigenous people register their lands through the NCIP. However, the organization\u2019s limited budget and the process by which nonindigenous groups can contest indigenous land claims have derailed indigenous land registration in practice.124 As a result, many indigenous groups have resorted to informal alternative arrangements with local government officials instead of formal registration,125 a practice the NCIP has allowed at times. Since the indigenous claims to these technically still unregistered lands are recognized only informally by local governments and municipalities, these lands can still be contested by the government due to the absence of formal property rights. In the Philippines, indigenous groups regularly face forcible removal from their lands when mining and plantation projects are concerned.126 Prioritizing a major investment project like the Kaliwa Dam or the CRPIP undermines this NCIP practice by allowing the national government to forcibly take the land without due process.127\nThe Philippine government acting through the NCIP went through the pro forma motions of getting the consent of local inhabitants for the Kaliwa Dam and the CRPIP, but in reality, they seem to have cut corners and possibly withheld information.128 Many families stood to be affected, and many in the Dumagat-Remontado community opposed the Kawila Dam project.129 Although MWSS Administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that the dam would impact a mere \u201c46 families,\u201d protesters counter that the number of affected residents has been downplayed and that it reportedly would actually affect \u201celeven villages and thirty-nine indigenous communities.\u201d 130 The Philippine government claimed that it had secured residents\u2019 FPIC anyway, and the project moved forward despite opposition. The government ignored the opposition and simply rubberstamped the decision. The Katribu Coalition, a national alliance of regional and provincial organizations for indigenous people, and community members were confused about the results, filing a complaint in court. One of the figures who helped was then opposition senate candidate Pepe Diokno, who organized a national press conference against the dam and demanded that the project\u2019s details be made public. In an interview, he said that he \u201csaw the documents of the NCIP, and it was obviously rushed without any due process.\u201d131\nThe acquisition of environmental compliance certificates for the Kaliwa Dam reportedly has also been unusually fast.132 In an interview, Cari\u00f1o told the author that \u201cthe Philippine government produced everything [without the usual process]. There was an environmental impact certificate even though no one actually conducted a geological assessment or any other test.\u201d133 And Cari\u00f1o added, \u201cThey are building two hydropower dams in other parts of Cordillera. It is not clear what the effect of the river pump will be on all the rivers once these dams are built. It seems like they are taking a piecemeal approach to the dams.\u201d134\nA Katribu activist who organized against the Kaliwa Dam at the early stages of the project said, \u201cWe saw them building bunk houses for the construction workers and expanding the access road for the adjacent infrastructure. But in no way did they do any environmental impact assessment. They produced it in a few weeks!\u201d135 Speaking about the two projects, an ex-official from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources noted in an author interview, \u201cWe would normally need six months to finish all the tests, but both of these are priority projects for the government. Malaca\u00f1ang needed them done.\u201d136\nIn the process of acquiring consent, reclaiming land, and conducting environmental assessments, the Duterte administration has also enlisted the support of the Philippine armed forces. At the Kaliwa Dam, the expansion of military checkpoints and the arrests of civil society leaders have limited the mobilization of an opposition. The CRPIP is located in the Kalinga area, which was already heavy militarized, so it has experienced even more repression. In 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic made it even more difficult for opposition activists to mobilize. Curfews and community lockdowns emboldened the Duterte government to arrest more civil society members.137\nOpposition politicians and many analysts have argued that Chinese lenders and dam builders have successfully bribed Duterte.138 However, what these views ignore is that the Chinese projects, though they could advance China\u2019s interests, reflected Duterte\u2019s willful attempt to maximize his political influence. The Chinese parties involved were indifferent to these project details (which the Philippine actors handled); rather, what was crucial to Beijing was securing a temporary friendship with the Duterte regime.\nThe principal story of the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP is not that they were financed by Chinese players but that these Chinese actors accommodated Duterte\u2019s political goals and deferred to his team on most of his demands. These accommodations allowed the Duterte government to pursue a domestic political agenda and made it much easier for the ruling powers in Manila to accept China\u2019s secrecy and protection clauses.\nChinese actors accommodated the needs of the Philippine political elites in power exclusively and did not invest in building relationships with Philippine opposition figures or civil society actors. This was a good short-term arrangement for Duterte but, over the long term, it has meant that these Chinese-funded projects have served the political agendas of select powerful elites while marginalizing local communities. These actions seem certain to generate long-term resentment against Chinese firms that could backfire if and when power in Manila changes hands.\nSeveral lessons from this experience follow. First, although Chinese players extracted contract clauses that increase their commercial leverage, this does not reflect an especially strategic diplomatic approach in relation to a country like the Philippines, whose turbulent politics is marked by frequent power reshuffles among rival elite players. China can be both a more strategic and a more responsible development actor by demanding that host countries adhere to higher standards on land reclamation and environmental impact assessments.\nTo do this, Chinese actors could, for example, demand that host countries follow the procedures by the World Bank and other international organizations on social and environmental impact assessments. Chinese firms could coordinate with government officials in host countries on how to implement these policies. The Chinese government could even mandate that Chinese firms follow these procedures. Such coordination on the part of the Chinese government has been done on issues related to carbon emissions, where Chinese firms have committed to implementing less environmentally destructive coal-fired power plant technology, while increasing efforts to leverage carbon capture technology.\nSecond, Chinese players should broaden their outreach in countries like the Philippines\u2014not least by working with civil society organizations and social movements to secure the consent of local inhabitants, land, and environmental impact assessments. By working directly with community organizations, not just national officials and their associated local political allies, the Chinese state and firms can increase their legitimacy as development actors in the Global South.\nAs for the Philippines, the Duterte administration and those that follow should reject the temptation to expedite foreign-funded projects for political gain. Increasing the budget for the NCIP for protecting indigenous rights, securing the consent of local communities, and conducting thorough environmental impact assessments would do much to increase the legitimacy of major infrastructure projects while broadening trust and support among a wider swath of Philippine political actors and the public. Such policies should be enacted through laws, which would make it more difficult for future Philippine governments to circumvent established procedures on project design and implementation.\nAlvin Camba is an assistant professor at the Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.

Inflows and outflows cannot be disentangled from the sunk cost of investing; this means that if a firm invested during the Arroyo administration but reinvested during Aquino\u2019s tenure due to the amount of time it took to profit, the data would display as Chinese FDI during Aquino\u2019s administration. However, this inflow suffers from the timing discrepancy between investment negotiation and realization. In addition, reinvestment is not meaningful because sunk cost issues are weighed against past decisions.\n40 Alvin Camba and Janica Magat, \u201cHow Do Investors Respond to Territorial Disputes?

                    "value": "Check your email for details on your request.\nCheck your email for details on your request.\nLatin America\u2019s existing predicament stems from a complex set of interlinked social, economic, and political crises, which have been magnified by the advent of the coronavirus pandemic and a rising tide of isolationism and \u201cantiglobalism.\u201d These crises range from domestic polarization and economic travails, to ideological divergence, personal rivalries among the region\u2019s leaders and U.S.-Chinese geopolitical competition, and all are hampering regional governance and negatively impacting the prospects of cooperation.\nLatin American governments urgently need to work together to address the manifold challenges they face as events in recent decades have shown that unless better regional mechanisms can be found, domestic and transnational challenges\u2014from organized crime and environmental degradation to migration and anemic economic growth\u2014will become even more difficult to address, with potentially devastating long-term consequences. Yet, despite the high stakes, traditional regional governance mechanisms seem paralyzed, lacking even the capacity to discuss the current untenable situation, let alone address it. The conventional wisdom is that regional cooperation across Latin America is practically nonexistent because its heads of states have insurmountable ideological differences and because the region\u2019s dominant diplomatic institutions have failed to fulfill their purpose.\nAll is not lost in the realm of regional governance, however. While cooperation is either dysfunctional or nonexistent in many dimensions, in others it persists with surprising resilience and vigor, although it is often overlooked or underappreciated. Existing cooperation is for the most part technical and based on the committed work by government officials who, even during the bleakest moments of the pandemic, have shown adherence to principled norms and driven by a refreshing degree of pragmatism.\nEffective regional governance and cooperation in Latin America is necessary for a broader conversation on the region\u2019s role in a rapidly changing global order, shaped by technological transformation and genuinely global problems such as climate change, migratory pressures, and increasing security threats. As great power competition continues to shape the global order, Latin America often is regarded as a peripheral player. Yet far from being somehow apart or exempt from today\u2019s rising geopolitical currents, Latin America, for better or for worse, is very much affected by them. Regional governance is a fundamental instrument to help Latin America overcome its numerous daunting challenges. Even when ideological differences make cooperation difficult at the high politics level, it is crucial to find avenues of progress at other levels and in informal or less visible ways.\nLatin America is experiencing one of the most difficult moments in its recent history as it confronts three overlapping crises: the coronavirus pandemic, a steep economic contraction, and high levels of political polarization and democratic erosion. No region has been more impacted by COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, than Latin America, both in human and economic terms.1 As of April 30, 2021, Latin America had a total of 28 million confirmed cases (out of a world total of 150 million) and just over 900,000 deaths (out of a world total of just over 3 million). With around 8 percent of the world\u2019s population, the region has almost 19 percent of confirmed cases and 28 percent of total deaths. Also, as of April 30, Latin America had administered only 8 percent of the total vaccines.2\nThe economic impact has been equally devastating. The World Bank estimates that in 2020, 53 million Latin Americans saw their income fall below the region\u2019s poverty line of $5.50 per day, pushing up the percentage of those living in poverty to an estimated 37.7 percent\u2014a level not seen since 2006.3 According to the United Nations (UN) Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Latin America is suffering its worst economic crisis in 120 years, with gross domestic product (GDP) having declined by a staggering 9.1 percent in 2020, eliminating most of the progress made during the commodity boom years (2003\u20132013). As might be expected, governments across the region are grappling with serious fiscal limitations and seem hard pressed to offer even basic responses to their population\u2019s significant needs.4 All the while, a toxic mix of insecurity and pervasive social turmoil is crippling most countries. As if this were not enough, the region faces what is arguably the most acute migration crisis of its history, with the exodus in recent years of more than 5 million Venezuelans.5\nSeveral reasons explain why the region was hit so hard by the pandemic. First, even before the pandemic began, Latin America was economically vulnerable. Between 2014 and 2019, the region\u2019s GDP per capita shrank 4 percent, largely as a result of significant declines in commodity prices.6 As part of these economic difficulties, chronic underinvestment in public health limited most countries\u2019 capacity to treat COVID-19 patients, especially during the most acute periods of the disease. In addition, fiscal constraints limited governments\u2019 ability to provide emergency cash-transfer payments to the poorest in their societies. Labor productivity and the job market were also hit hard by lockdown orders and workplace closures: only about 20 percent of existing jobs in Latin America could be performed remotely, compared to 40 percent in advanced economies and 26 percent in the rest of the emerging world.7\nSecond, the region entered the pandemic in a politically vulnerable condition. Throughout 2019, large-scale protests rocked Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, and Venezuela, creating one of the most politically volatile years in memory.8 In most cases, social turmoil stemmed from popular frustration with low-quality public services, socioeconomic inequality, and detached political elites. Many people who joined Latin America\u2019s new middle class during the commodity boom of the 2000s slid back into poverty during the 2010s, and faced the realization that both they and their children are unlikely to escape poverty for many years to come. Popular demands for economic justice and support became more intense and difficult for governments to satisfy, creating openings for radical antiestablishment figures to come to power, like President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil or President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador.\nFinally, the region is beset by severe political polarization and democratic backsliding.9 In Mexico, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is undermining democracy by seeking to concentrate power in an already strong executive.10 In Nicaragua, the increasingly authoritarian administration of President Daniel Ortega has pushed through new laws to name \u201ctraitors\u201d and to pressure media and human rights groups opposing his grip on power. At the time of writing, there have been twelve opponents detained since June 2.11 In El Salvador, Bukele has enacted a series of controversial policies that many observers believe represent a serious threat to democracy. Neighboring Honduras is not faring much better, as an inflammable mix of corruption, violence, and authoritarianism under President Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez is generating massive outmigration. Ecuador recently has seen widespread discontent, while Peru witnessed massive protests and instability following the legislature\u2019s ousting of caretaker President Mart\u00edn Vizcarra in 2020.\nAnother regional trend, present in both Ecuador and Peru as well as in other countries, has been the acute fragmentation of political parties, which has made governance exceedingly difficult.12 Colombia is in the midst of a serious crisis with widespread protests and a resurgence of politically driven violence, with one social leader killed every forty-one hours.13 Argentina\u2019s economy has hit rock bottom as its government aims to reach a deal with the International Monetary Fund while tackling high inflation rates. Following former U.S. president Donald Trump\u2019s playbook, Brazil\u2019s right-wing Bolsonaro continuously glorifies dictatorship and tests the resilience of Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions. In May 2020, for instance, Bolsonaro, while facing allegations that he tried to meddle with law enforcement for personal reasons, had to be convinced by generals to not ask soldiers to close the Supreme Court.14 Chile, once regarded as one of the region\u2019s few bright spots due to its economic growth and political stability, also has witnessed massive demonstrations and violent riots against the establishment. It now has the daunting task of attempting to design a new constitution even as it struggles to respond to the pandemic and undertake a rapid vaccination program to protect its citizens.\nGiven this complex set of interlinked social, economic, and political crises, Latin American governments and nongovernmental actors urgently need to work together to address collective challenges. The events of recent decades have shown that unless better regional mechanisms can be found, transnational and even domestic problems\u2014from organized crime and environmental degradation to migration and lackluster economic growth\u2014will become even more difficult to address, with potentially devastating long-term consequences. Yet traditional regional governance mechanisms seem paralyzed, lacking even the capacity to discuss the current untenable situation, let alone address it. The popular narrative is that regional cooperation across Latin America is practically nonexistent because its heads of states have insurmountable ideological differences and because the region\u2019s dominant diplomatic institutions have failed to fulfill their purpose. In addition, domestic turmoil is fueling rising isolationism and \u201cantiglobalism,\u201d most prominently in Brazil. Such a pessimistic view, however, stifles any capacity to reimagine regional cooperation. The dramatic crisis in Latin America requires more creative thinking, not less, about ways to promote renewed channels for regional cooperation.15\nThe situation in Latin America is indeed dire and there is significant room for sweeping pessimism; however, this paper posits that not all is lost in the realm of regional governance. True, in many dimensions, regional cooperation is either dysfunctional or nonexistent. In others, it persists, but often is overlooked or underappreciated. For example, in the realm of migration, existing regional norms have enabled Latin American governments to respond to the Venezuelan migration crisis. Even during the bleakest moments of the pandemic, some degree of technical cooperation took place across the region, steered by refreshingly pragmatic government officials. Extensive research and interviews with current and former government officials and scholars reveal how, underneath the acrimonious high politics rhetoric that sows distrust and often closes the door to meaningful cooperation, areas such as migration, health, security, and the administration of justice all have benefited from such technical cooperation efforts.16\nFor those who seek to strengthen regional governance in Latin America, these cases are crucial to understanding the state of existing cooperation and assessing the prospects for deepening translational links in other relevant areas. Notably, these cooperation schemes often fall under the radar, as they do not involve presidential summits or other high-profile diplomatic activities. Rather, they may involve government bureaucracies, the judiciary, or the armed forces, as well as subnational actors such as governors or mayors.17 By default, foreign policy experts tend to focus primarily on high politics\u2014the doings of presidents and foreign ministers\u2014which are precisely the areas where cooperation seems near-absent.\nWith this background in mind, this paper is organized into three sections. The first describes the impact that domestic factors, including democratic erosion, political polarization, and socioeconomic turmoil, are having on regional cooperation. This discussion highlights the manifest gap between the urgent problems that demand attention and the regional institutional mechanisms to address them. The second section examines the condition of existing regional governance. It begins by assessing the current condition of regional organizations, including the Organization of American States (OAS), the Southern Economic Market (Mercosur), the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and the recently created Forum for the Progress and Development of South America (PROSUR). It then analyzes cooperation initiatives in six thematic domains: migration, health, security, trade, democracy and human rights, and great power competition. The final section offers ten proposals about how to reframe and revive regional cooperation.\nThe paper reflects the authors\u2019 belief that regional governance is a fundamental instrument to help Latin America overcome its numerous, daunting challenges.18 It also embodies the view that even when ideological differences make cooperation difficult at the high politics level, it is crucial to find avenues of progress at other levels and in informal or less visible ways. More broadly, the paper proceeds from the conviction that effective regional governance and cooperation in Latin America is necessary for a broader conversation on the region\u2019s role in a rapidly changing global order, shaped by technological transformation and genuinely global problems such as climate change, migratory pressures, and increasing security threats. As great power competition continues to shape the global order, Latin America often is regarded as a peripheral player.19 Yet far from being somehow apart or exempt from today\u2019s rising geopolitical currents, Latin America, for better or for worse, is very much affected by them.\nDespite the existence of historical rivalries among several countries, Latin America boasts a long and fruitful tradition of cooperation in diverse issue areas. The region\u2019s commitment toward collective approaches based upon a shared normative view is evident in its many cooperative mechanisms and institutions, including the diplomatic forum of the OAS, the UN-supported economic support structures of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the public health interests of the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). Regional cooperation in Latin America saw remarkable progress during the 1990s and 2000s, with the creation of many normative arrangements, particularly in the realm of democracy and human rights. The latter were protected and legalized at the regional level, with the OAS and other regional bodies signing democratic instruments. Despite their imperfections and shortcomings, agreements such as the Santiago Commitment to Democracy (1991), the creation of Mercosur (1991) and its democratic clause (1998), the Inter-American Democratic Charter (2001), and the South American Defense Council (2009) helped lay the groundwork for an unprecedented degree of cooperation.\nThe wave of democratization that swept the region in the 1990s disseminated a normative commitment to democratic values. This political shift, though far from comprehensive, helped stabilize political affairs in moments of crisis and created an unprecedented degree of trust between leading policymakers across the region.20 A pivotal event in the new democratizing movement was a meeting of all South American presidents in 2000\u2014the first summit of its kind, which led to numerous high-level meetings in the years that followed.21 Other notable moments of diplomatic success included efforts to reduce tensions between Peru and Ecuador in 1995 after a brief border dispute, successfully steering the two nations toward the signing of a peace deal in Bras\u00edlia in 1998. Similarly, regional leaders helped to ameliorate mounting political tensions that threatened democracy in Paraguay in 1996 and 1999. Regional actors also convinced Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to open a dialogue with opposition leaders after a failed military coup in 2002.22 South American governments strengthened their ties with Central America, Mexico, and some Caribbean nations in this period, as reflected by a growing number of visits of South American heads of state to their northern counterparts during the 2000s. Helped by the commodity boom, leaders across the region were able to increase social spending and enjoyed high approval ratings, facilitating frequent reelections. Since the end of the Cold War, many parts of the world have followed the trend of a greater emphasis on regional integration, and as a consequence regional organizations have proliferated. Latin America was no exception to this trend.23\nThat said, even though regional institutions and platforms have multiplied across Latin America, mounting divisions have caused the region to backslide in terms of the depth of regional cooperation and the capacity to address common challenges. Examples of this negative trend include Bolsonaro\u2019s refusal to congratulate his Argentine counterpart, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, on his victory in 2019; Venezuela\u2019s near-complete diplomatic isolation; and L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s frosty relations with fellow Latin American leaders.24 On a related matter, the Lava Jato corruption scandal involving Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht\u2014a company that traditionally had been the poster child of regional integration, owing to its activity in numerous countries across Latin America\u2014raised uncomfortable questions about the role Brazilian administrations had played in the region.\nThe struggles of regional cooperation have been most noticeable in moments of domestic political turmoil. As Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador witnessed massive political and social upheavals in 2019, regional actors not only failed to offer help\u2014by acting as mediators, for example\u2014but actually worsened the already volatile situations through untimely, inflammatory declarations. When Bolivia\u2019s security forces ousted then president Evo Morales after a disputed election, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared, without offering any evidence, that the United States had been involved. Argentina\u2019s government, similarly, described events in Bolivia as a coup, while Brazil\u2019s government called the process entirely legitimate.25 For their part, the governments of countries enduring social turmoil were too ready to blame their problems on their neighbors. When large-scale demonstrations erupted in Chile and Ecuador in 2019, authorities from both countries argued that Cuban and Venezuelan operatives were behind the unrest, also without providing concrete evidence for their claims.26 Rather than helping both countries address the crisis, the rumors about supposed foreign interference were fomented by the government of Brazil and, more worrisome still, by OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro of Uruguay.27\nDivisions widened further after countries adopted diametrically opposed strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. While Peru and Argentina embraced stringent lockdowns similar to European countries, the presidents of Brazil and Nicaragua opted for denialism and refused to acknowledge the severity of the threat. Bolsonaro dismissed three ministers of health in the midst of the pandemic, severely limiting the potential for health officials to articulate broader regional cooperation, including medical research, border closures, medicine distribution, and vaccine purchasing. At a time when Chile was making rapid progress vaccinating a growing percentage of its population, some other countries in the region, such as Venezuela, had not been able to provide shots even to high-risk groups.\nSeveral reasons may explain why regional mechanisms have ceased playing an effective role in the existing circumstances and, more broadly, why multilateralism in Latin America is facing what is arguably its worst crisis in decades.\nFirst, the region lacks leaders who are willing to champion regional cooperation or have the political clout necessary to promote a shared vision for the future. After the victories of Mexico\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro in late 2018, Latin America\u2019s two largest countries embraced a profoundly nationalistic discourse that openly rebuked regional cooperation and multilateral engagement. With few exceptions, the Brazilian government\u2019s \u201cantiglobalist\u201d faction largely sees international rules and norms as a threat to its sovereignty, frequently attacking institutions such as the UN.28 Similarly, L\u00f3pez Obrador prioritizes a domestic agenda with nationalist overtones and pushes for a transactional view of foreign relations. Having two of the region\u2019s largest and most influential countries shun multilateralism presents formidable problems.29 Yet even prior to the rise of nationalist leaders, concerns about sovereignty posed significant obstacles to deeper integration.\nSecond, several countries that have been more committed to multilateral approaches and could attempt to fill the vacuum are enduring severe internal crises that have prevented them from taking a leadership role. Chile is a case in point: in 2019, it was forced to withdraw as the host of the UN\u2019s Climate Summit in order to \u201cprioritize re-establishing public order\u201d30\u2014namely, widespread antigovernment protests. This decision was all the more embarrassing for Chile because it had stepped up and offered to host the summit when the previous host, Brazil, had backed out of holding the event. Because of the protests, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era opted to cancel not only the UN summit but also the 2019 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where Trump and China\u2019s President Xi Jinping were supposed to meet. In the same way, numerous other governments in the region, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, face too many domestic problems to project a coherent strategic vision, or lack the political weight to mobilize others. The few countries that defend multilateralism and enjoy political stability, such as Costa Rica, Panama, and Uruguay, lack the wherewithal needed to set in motion a regional agenda.\nThird, decreasing popular support is rendering governments across the region domestically vulnerable and politically paralyzed. This trend derives in part from the end of an unprecedented era of economic growth during the commodity boom in the 2000s, which furnished incumbents with the resources needed to increase public spending on social policies.31 Following the commodity bust, the popularity of incumbents plummeted, driven by their electorates\u2019 anger at the abrupt halt in social programs and investments and the slowing-down of inequality reduction\u2014the so-called Toqueville Effect, in which social frustration grows as social conditions and opportunities improve. In a sense, persistent inequality and the associated political ups and downs pose serious obstacles to building political legitimacy and intertemporal public policies. Regional governance efforts are especially vulnerable under such volatile conditions. In 2020, for instance, not a single president in the region won reelection\u2014the exception being Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whose election for a new term was broadly seen as being neither free nor fair. In addition, the surge of populist leaders in several countries who railed against the political establishment has reduced the space available to more experienced politicians. This phenomenon is particularly visible in (but not limited to) Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry, which at present is led by diplomats who had never even occupied ambassadorial posts abroad before joining the cabinet, and thus had a more limited international network.\nFourth, marked political antagonism between leaders, often linked to domestic considerations, has made cooperation exceedingly difficult. Rifts often pit far-right leaders such as Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro against their leftist counterparts such as Argentina\u2019s Fern\u00e1ndez and Mexico\u2019s L\u00f3pez Obrador. In August 2019, Bolsonaro utilized hostile rhetoric toward Fern\u00e1ndez, calling him a \u201cleftist bandit,\u201d and Fern\u00e1ndez enraged Bolsonaro by expressing his sympathy for Brazil\u2019s ex-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro\u2019s archenemy.32 The strong ideological divergence between heads of state in the region has produced rival alliances, such as PROSUR, a bloc of center-right governments, and the Puebla Group, an amalgam of left-wing and center-left presidents, former presidents, and intellectuals. Given their dependence on ideological alignment, none of these initiatives can be expected to outlive more than one electoral cycle.\nFifth, Latin American policymakers have failed to contain Venezuela\u2019s acute social, economic, and political crisis, which has been going on for nearly two decades and has poisoned regional multilateralism. Although the failed coup in 2002 was addressed in a relatively constructive manner, Venezuela\u2019s subsequent decline into an authoritarian state has polarized the region. For a time\u2014particularly until the death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2014Venezuela had remarkable financial and political influence in Latin America, and governments across the Western Hemisphere were sharply divided on their responses to it, to the point where it became it impossible to hold a regional meeting with all heads of state. Today, Latin American governments continue to disagree over whether Maduro is Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state, or how to address Venezuela\u2019s existential crisis. This rift is symbolized by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s decision in March 2021 to remove Argentina from the Lima Group, a platform established to coordinate the regional response to the Venezuela crisis.33 Latin American countries\u2019 influence over Caracas is also overshadowed by the growing role being played by major outside powers such as China, Russia, and the United States. Even though Venezuela\u2019s collapse has deeply affected the continent, Latin American governments have become mere bystanders to the crisis.\nVenezuela\u2019s negative impact on hemispheric affairs has become an even greater concern for countries in the region, given the flight of millions of Venezuelans to other parts of Latin America. The exodus has grown to such proportions that no country can afford to remain indifferent anymore. Unfortunately, however, many decisionmakers have found out that the crisis provides an opportunity to further their objectives and thus many have politicized the matter. Brazil is a case in point. While far-right leaders like Bolsonaro accuse left-wing politicians of supposedly seeking to transform Brazil into a Venezuela, the opposition frequently points to parallels between the president and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who also allowed the country\u2019s armed forces to take on extraordinary political powers.\nSixth, weakened states have had to confront ever more powerful organized criminal groups, many of which operate transnationally. Criminal activity has led to serious deterioration in security conditions across the region, marked by rising levels of violence and human rights violations linked to governments attempts to control crime. In several countries, including Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela, there is evidence of organized crime either collaborating with or infiltrating the country\u2019s security institutions. In the same way, organized crime has gained greater political influence by either funding political campaigns or, even more directly, launching their own candidates.34 There is growing evidence that the pandemic has strengthened the role of organized crime across Latin America.35 This trend has ominous consequences for the region\u2019s capacity to tackle not only security but also other issues including health, education, and the environment.\nSeventh, as will be discussed in the third section, the emergence of great power politics in Latin America adds a further layer to regional dynamics that is unlikely to strengthen multilateralism. The geopolitical competition between the United States and a rising China is constraining other countries\u2019 room for maneuvering and further undercutting the prospects for regional cooperation. Notably, it risks politicizing foreign policy\u2014as seen in Brazil, where Bolsonaro was one of the first Latin American presidents to be elected on an openly anti-China platform\u2014which makes a rational debate about the subject more difficult. The more that other leaders embrace one-sided approaches, in either direction, the more difficult it will be to find ways to successfully manage the consequences of the return of great power politics in Latin America.\nFinally, the region\u2019s challenging economic context must be considered. Numerous Latin American countries have stopped growing or did so at lower rates than in the early 2000s (see figure 1). When growth did take place, it happened at lower rates than other developing regions. Intraregional trade, for example, grew slower for most countries than extraregional trade.36 For most Latin American countries, trade with China and the United States is now far more important than trade with neighboring countries. Reflecting the growth of the commodities markets, particularly in China, Latin America\u2019s economic complexity has been reduced (see figure 2). This re-primarization of its trade does not favor more regional integration, as it is the faltering manufacturing sector that drives regional exchange.\nPerhaps most telling, trade between Brazil and Argentina declined in relative and absolute terms over the past decade. Brazil\u2019s exports to Argentina fell from 11 percent to 6 percent of total exports between 2000 and 2018. Uruguay\u2019s exports to Argentina and Brazil respectively likewise shrank from 17 percent to 5 percent and from 23 percent to 12 percent for the same period. Chile\u2019s exports to Argentina are one-third of what they were only 10 years ago.\nOnly in Central America does intraregional trade show a more positive trajectory.37 In 2020, for the first time, Brazil ceased to be Argentina\u2019s largest trading partner, being overtaken by China. As a consequence, individuals in many countries who have called for greater regional integration have seen their political influence decline.38 The case of Brazil is symbolic: when the Bolsonaro government questioned the usefulness of Mercosur, only a small and politically marginalized group, made up mostly of academics and retired policymakers, sounded the alarm. The bloc\u2019s thirtieth anniversary\u2014celebrated in March 2021 and dominated by mutual recriminations between Uruguay and Argentina\u2014produced little public reflection about the future of the region. Given the important role that the creation of Mercosur played in ending the geopolitical rivalry between Argentina and Brazil that shaped regional dynamics for decades, this omission was remarkable.\nThese eight reasons explain why regional cooperation in Latin America is facing so many difficulties. They also lay out the size of the challenge that policymakers, bureaucrats, and scholars face as they seek to articulate strategies to lessen the damage and identify ways to actually strengthen cooperation in specific areas. As suggested above, the price of inaction is far too high to simply accept the status quo as a political reality that cannot be changed. The next section unpacks regional cooperation and offers a more nuanced analysis on the main drivers of collective action in Latin America and the alternatives that lie ahead.\nIf the state of intergovernmental organizations is a barometer of regional cooperation in Latin America, then the picture looks bleak. The OAS, the oldest and most influential regional body, is going through what is arguably its worst institutional crisis since its creation in 1948. Divisiveness over thorny issues, in particular how to handle the Venezuelan and Honduran democratic crises, has led to bickering and paralysis. Particularly harmful were the attacks led by Venezuela and likeminded states of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America against some OAS divisions such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, one of the organization\u2019s most prestigious and important specialized bodies. These attacks sought to undermine the OAS as a whole and deflect attention from the accusers\u2019 problematic democratic and human rights records.\nYet other reasons have contributed to the organization\u2019s steady decline. A lack of levelheaded, skillful leadership on the part of the OAS secretary general has eroded the organization\u2019s stance and credibility. Although this problem dates back to the tenure of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza of Chile, it became particularly pernicious under Luis Almagro of Uruguay, the current secretary general. Almagro\u2019s tenure has been characterized by an abrasive, lopsided, and ultimately counterproductive style that has further dented the organization\u2019s credibility.\nOther organizations have not fared much better. UNASUR, created in 2008 as a purported South American alternative to the OAS (that excludes the United States and Mexico), predictably replicated the crippling divisions afflicting the Western Hemisphere. Acrimony and divisiveness became apparent almost immediately within the newly created body, as Brazil and Venezuela jockeyed for influence and countries such as Colombia and (to a lesser degree) Chile withheld their support and manifested their reservations. The worsening crises in Venezuela and Brazil ended up sinking the project in less than a decade. In Mercosur, meanwhile, steep divisions between member states have tested the limits of the trading bloc\u2019s economic integration capacity. The inception in 2019 of PROSUR, a recently created club of like-minded states promoted by Pi\u00f1era and Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque, promises to replicate many of UNASUR\u2019s shortcomings by advancing a center-right-wing agenda not shared by many countries in the region. Given its clear ideological tilt, PROSUR cannot be expected to survive the election of a leftist leader in one of its founding member states.\nHowever, while political antagonism, mistrust, and opportunism have greatly damaged regional cooperation, a resilient undercurrent of cooperation has continued to flow amid the paralysis in higher political circles. This cooperation has two main sources. The first is the stock of global multilateral norms that the region has been able to transfer into the domestic domain. These norms have provided a standardized vocabulary to facilitate regional cooperation. Migration is a case in point: the South American Conference on Migration resulted from the impetus provided by the Cairo Conference on Population and Development. In health, the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s International Health Regulations played a central role in organizing regional cooperation. For anticorruption issues, the UN Convention Against Corruption played a key role in promoting related initiatives at the OAS and the Inter-American Development Bank. Through these multilateral channels, regional engagement has been able to continue even when national leaders fail to see eye to eye on larger policy questions.\nThe second source of cooperation is the national bureaucracies, experts, and watchdogs in each country that have sought to go beyond the electoral cycle to think of regional solutions.39 With creativity and scarce resources, these actors\u2014together with civil society networks\u2014have been able to push, within limits, a technical cooperation agenda on issues as varied as security, health, migration, and human rights. This undercurrent seems crucial today and needs to be examined more closely, as it may offer clues to break the region\u2019s ongoing deadlock. The following sections, therefore, look at existing cooperation initiatives in six issue areas: migration, health, security, trade, democracy and human rights, and the return of great power politics. For each issue area, there are three fundamental questions about big-picture trends: (1) Why does the issue matter? (2) Why did cooperation work? and (3) What are the risks and prospects for future cooperation in this area?\nWhy it matters. Migratory pressures are placing great strains on Latin American transit and receiving countries to integrate growing numbers of economic migrants and refugees.40 Latin America is home to two serious migration crises that are among the most acute in the world. The Venezuelan exodus is second in size only to the migratory catastrophe connected with the Syrian civil war. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of January 2021, 5.4 million Venezuelans had left their country, 4.6 million of whom moved to countries in the Americas.41 In northern Central America, meanwhile, a toxic combination of poverty and violence coupled with the attraction of a better life in the United States has pushed around 1 million people to flee their homes.\nThe state of cooperation. The growth of intraregional migration has led to important levels of cooperation on this issue in both South and Central America over the past three decades, including the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees (1984), the San Jos\u00e9 Declaration on Refugees and Displaced Persons (1994), and the South American Conference on Migration (2000). The landmark Mercosur Residence Agreement (2002) extended permission for citizens of ten South American countries to reside and work in Mercosur member states for up to two years and offered a path to citizenship in member states and associated countries. This agreement came out of extensive dialogue and convergence between Argentine and Brazilian technical officials. Once Argentina and Brazil set the spirit and content of the agreement, a normative spillover followed suit in the region. The process enabled migrants in several receiving countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and as of late Colombia, to secure documentation to regularize their immigration status.42 Similarly in Central America, countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua have established the CA4 agreement, which grants free transit and other coordination mechanisms facilitating the free movement of people. Countries across the region also strived to implement the Cartagena Declaration, which introduces a more expansive interpretation of the conditions for granting refugee status\u2014beyond an individual\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution\u2014thereby opening their doors to thousands of people escaping situations of generalized violence and massive violations of human rights.43\nRisks and opportunities ahead. The sudden explosion of Venezuelan outmigration caused by the acute sociopolitical crisis afflicting the country has revealed some of the limitations of cooperation in this area (see figure 3). In the beginning, most countries adopted a pragmatic stance and opened their doors to Venezuelan migrants, opting for quick regularization. Peru, for instance, extended its Temporary Permanence Permit, and Ecuador and Brazil offered humanitarian visas. However, as the number of migrants kept increasing, solidarity started to wane. All countries struggled greatly to absorb the sudden arrival of masses of Venezuelans and extend to them critical social services such as housing, healthcare, and education. Stretched to the limit and concerned about the strain the new arrivals would have on their societies\u2019 highly informal labor markets, formerly welcoming countries began to place barriers to the entry of foreigners (such as visas or limited working permits), effectively undermining free movement. Matters worsened further still with the advent of the coronavirus pandemic, as most countries decided to close their borders to prevent further transmission of the virus. At the same time, domestic pressure for stricter controls over migration arose as public opinion demanded that governments prioritize nationals for vital social services.44\nA complex context characterized by simultaneous health and economic crises saw the emergence of virulent episodes of xenophobia, which have further strained the relationships between sending and receiving countries across the region. Free riding in the context of a crisis that ideally would be better tackled through collective burden sharing gave rise to regional tensions similar to those seen in Europe during the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis. Relations also have been strained by the creation of humanitarian corridors to expedite the movement of people to bordering countries, as well as unilateral and sudden border closures that have forced Venezuelan migrants and refugees to remain in transit countries, unable to reach their preferred destinations for the foreseeable future. Quito protested when Lima imposed visas on Venezuelans and temporarily closed its northern border with Ecuador.45 Ecuador then followed suit by closing its borders with Peru and Colombia. Bogot\u00e1 also protested. Later, Chile prevented Venezuelans from entering its territory via its northern port city of Arica. In other words, the region moved from cooperation to recrimination to the rise of unilateral measures to cope with the difficult international and domestic context of migration.\nA renewed effort to develop a regional strategy to address Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis could alleviate existing pressures. To start, governments could commit to adopting the same strategy and bureaucratic requirements at their borders, standardizing the process of regularizing migrants (for example, school registration for children). Second, they should develop a single monitoring system. With the help of their embassies in Caracas, it may be possible to collect data to design models that anticipate how many Venezuelans will leave each month\u2014and thus better prepare public services like care centers, schools, hospitals, and police in border regions. Third, governments in the region should develop a regional fund to support the countries hosting the highest number of migrants and refugees, such as Colombia. Finally, each government should name special envoys who meet monthly to oversee the entire process and discuss best practices for integrating newcomers. Colombia\u2019s announcement that it would regularize the status of 1.7 million Venezuelans who live in the country, and thus provide them access to work and social services, is one positive development that sets an important example and facilitates cooperation in this area.46\nIn Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle, where instability has produced a migratory crisis along the southern U.S. border, it is natural that the United States has taken the lead. Even there, a regionally inclusive rhetoric and approach that engages policymakers from across the region could help promote a sense that this is not only a problem between the United States and Central America but also a systemic problem that will bedevil the Americas for years and will require a joint effort to solve. One tangible consequence of the region\u2019s unwillingness to treat the twin migratory crises as a regional problem in the Americas is that the region received less aid from multilateral bodies (such as UNHCR) than was given to address other refugee crises. Latin American countries have received, on average, less than a tenth of the amount per capita that other countries received for the Syrian refugee crisis.47 Rarely, if ever, does the total number of migrants in all of the Americas appear in public debate, making initiatives like a regional summit on migration less likely.48\nFinally, involving subregional decisionmaking bodies, such as governors and mayors, will be crucial to assure that migrants can be successfully integrated. For example, cities like Barranquilla, which has the third-largest migrant population in Colombia, have made active efforts to boost migrant employment by launching social impact bonds that fund projects in which a percentage of jobs are reserved for migrants.49\nWhy it matters. The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the relevance of a more unified approach toward public health issues impacting Latin America. The pandemic has helped to raise awareness on common challenges in this field, from the fight against endemic diseases (for example, yellow fever, cholera, Zika virus disease, and tuberculosis) to the pressing healthcare needs of the region\u2019s migrant population, as the Venezuelan exodus has highlighted. Yet the reasoning goes beyond cooperation and solidarity; it has to do also with enlightened self-interest as the health of others is now part and parcel of national interest. Regional cooperation thus should not be seen as a reflection of altruism, but rather as mechanism enhancing states\u2019 national interest. Consequently, regional cooperation failures are better seen as rational\u2014not moral\u2014dilemmas.50 There is no doubt that regional cooperation in healthcare issues could make a significant difference in Latin America. Vaccinating people across countries will be a major test of the region\u2019s ability to cooperate.\nThe state of cooperation. Latin American countries traditionally have cooperated in the realm of health. PAHO, the oldest regional organization in the world to address global health, has been a successful venue for cooperation on public health at the regional level. It operates as both the health extension of the OAS and a regional office of the WHO. It coordinates twenty-seven offices and three specialized centers and is responsible for 185 of 813 WHO collaborating centers worldwide. For years, it has offered vital scientific and technical assistance to member states in eradicating and combating diseases and in devising sound public health programs.\nThese achievements and its robust reputation notwithstanding, for several years PAHO has been under scrutiny. In 2010, it was questioned for the difficulties it encountered in containing a cholera outbreak in Haiti. In 2015, both PAHO and the WHO were criticized for responding late and ineffectively to the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil that put the 2016 Olympic Games at risk. Three years later, PAHO was criticized again after the departure of 8,000 Cuban doctors who had earlier arrived in Brazil as part of the Mais M\u00e9dicos program, designed by then Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff in 2013.51 In August 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, the accumulated debt at PAHO was $162 million, with the United States holding 67 percent of that debt.52 Indeed, Trump was far more interested in blaming China for the pandemic than rallying an international response, his most noticeable move being to interrupt U.S. funding to the WHO and then have the United States leave the organization entirely.\nIn alternative fora, health was on the region\u2019s technical agenda but not the political menu. This was the case, among others, of the Andean Health Organization, composed of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This body was limited to technical discussions and constrained by existing political disputes between its member states\u2019 governments. Mercosur also established a working group on health and sought the harmonization of national health legislation as well as regional coordination to implement the International Health Regulations, first adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 and last revised in 2005. One of the merits of UNASUR was to raise the profile and importance of health. The result was the creation of the Health Council, driven mainly by Brazil, with an agenda based on the design of an epidemiological shield, universal access to medicines, and universal health systems\u2014three issues that the pandemic has brought back to the center of public health discussions. UNASUR not only promoted regional health governance but also took important steps to project itself externally through regional health diplomacy.53 Even though these initiatives have withered as a result of UNASUR\u2019s dramatic weakening, they sowed the seeds of cooperation by building transnational networks between professionals that could be reactivated in the future.\nRisks and opportunities ahead. In addition to the disparities among Latin American countries regarding their resources and health infrastructure, there are deep-seated internal inequalities that pose significant logistical challenges for vaccination programs. Vaccine distribution is set to be slower than expected. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s latest vaccine rollout forecast, only Chile and Uruguay can expect to see 60 percent of their adult population immunized by late 2021. A second group, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Peru, would reach that percentage by mid-2022. Ecuador would follow by late 2022. The worst estimates are for Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela, which are not expected to reach 60 percent until 2023.54\nThe coronavirus pandemic reintroduced the idea of universal health systems into discussions on public health planning. Over the past two decades, health status in Latin America has shown some positive signs in areas such as life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality. Yet the region still needs to make more significant investments in health across the board.55 Countries with delays in accessing vaccines will have to endure a longer pandemic than their better-resourced neighbors. Beyond global efforts to speed up vaccine distribution, such as the COVAX initiative, the region needs to be able to implement regional cooperation programs.56 In March 2021, the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) approved up to $1 billion to strengthen the region\u2019s health sector, including access to treatments, epidemiological surveillance, and medical procedures, as well as ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines and other supplies. Without projects like these, the region\u2019s recovery inevitably will be delayed even further.\nHow could countries in the region work together to address the pandemic? Governments could cooperate, for instance, by enhancing their respective capacity to secure the temperature-controlled supply chain, particularly to reach rural or remote areas. Governments with greater production capacity for medical supplies (like syringes and face masks) or instruments (like ventilators) could offer market access facilities. The same holds true for countries with greater experience in biohazard waste treatment. Specific initiatives, such as training for vaccine providers, could have an immediate impact in deprived areas. The software used to monitor the vaccines administered (particularly in cases where two doses are required) could be shared. Governments might develop joint campaigns against mistrust and lack of information about the safety and effects of vaccines, particularly at borders between countries.\nIn cases where a country\u2019s federal government does not share a science-based approach or is involved in spreading conspiracy theories, governors should be included. In Brazil, for example, governors of the major states including S\u00e3o Paulo, Bahia, and Rio Grande do Sul have actively sought to mitigate Bolsonaro\u2019s controversial policies and would most likely be interested in joining such an initiative. In border regions, cross-border hospital collaboration could compensate for shortcomings on either side, as proposed by the Mercosur Social Institute.57 In sum, Latin America should make a virtue out of scarcity and take advantage of this moment of limited vaccine supply to better plan its administration, attune time expectations, and coordinate the necessary aid among neighboring countries.\nWhy it matters. The sharp increase in violence in Latin America in the past twenty years has transformed it into one of the most dangerous regions in the world.58 The levels of violence are uneven from country to country, ranging from relatively low in Chile and Bolivia to extraordinarily high in Venezuela and El Salvador\u2014but violence is on the rise throughout the region. Violence occurs in epidemic proportions in the region, especially in the hardest-hit countries such as Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela. Not surprisingly, security has risen to the top of the political agenda. Insecurity is driven predominantly by armed nonstate actors of a criminal nature, many of them operating transnationally. Narcotrafficking in particular has had a severely negative effect on security across the region, while limited state capacity also plays a key role.59 Brazil\u2019s coastal city Rio de Janeiro, which was host to football\u2019s World Cup Final in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, provides an example of this challenge: An estimated 60 percent of Rio\u2019s territory is controlled by nonstate actors, largely militias that run extortion and drug rackets but are increasingly diversifying into other areas such as construction.60\nThe state of cooperation. While there is a pressing need to cooperate in security, it has not been easy to create encompassing mechanisms. Countries in the region consider security a sensitive domestic matter and therefore are reluctant to work together. Although the region exhibits an intricate web of collective security arrangements, security has been most effective when only a few like-minded players are involved: \u201cminilateralism\u201d rather than multilateralsim.61 Regional organizations, like OAS or UNASUR, have advanced confidence-building measures and conflict resolution mechanisms. However, when nonstate and interstate security are dangerously mixed, their leverage wanes. As in other areas, bilateral cooperation has been more fruitful, especially among the military and the police on the ground. The vast majority of cooperation schemes are anchored within defense ministries and thus have sidestepped traditional diplomatic channels that can be more politically sensitive. Technical cooperation, which includes information sharing, training, and border surveillance, often entails informal, low-key coordination mechanisms. Most of these schemes have been conducted through military channels.\nSecurity cooperation has been most fruitful in some particular bilateral contexts. One refers to bordering states with lingering rivalries that, in the hopes of improving their strained relations, have worked on confidence-building measures and other areas related to defense. A case in point is the cooperation between traditional rivals Chile and Argentina; their work has included information-sharing mechanisms regarding logistics and arms acquisition and the creation of the Cruz del Sur Combined Peace Force. Ecuador and Peru, also former rivals, have developed border cooperation initiatives that include information-sharing mechanisms, joint patrols, and the removal of mines in a large area of the border. There has also been cooperation in the fights against transnational criminal syndicates. Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, for example, have in place an interesting cooperation scheme in the Triple Border, though it has weakened over the years. The Brazilian Federal Police force has provided important support to Paraguay and Argentina in combating the Primeiro Comando da Capital, Brazil\u2019s largest criminal organization, which has extended its operations to bordering countries. Even at a time when Brazil and Venezuela no longer had diplomatic ties, their armed forces maintained regular but informal contact, providing a channel of last resort that could be of help in particularly tense situations. Regional exchange programs in military and police academies are therefore generally to be welcomed, even though the armed forces\u2019 broad involvement in politics\u2014such as in Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela\u2014is a growing concern.\nCooperation in the realm of security also arises as part of so called South-South schemes, whereby more resourceful countries offer training and technical expertise to less-developed neighbors, especially on matters related to policing.62 Brazil and Argentina, for instance, have provided important help to their Paraguayan counterparts, while the Chilean police (Carabineros de Chile) has had a long presence in Central America and participated extensively in the training of the newly created Haitian National Police, as part of the overall efforts on the part of Latin American countries in the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti.\nAn intriguing and emergent example of cooperation in the realm of security is the country of Colombia. Its successful experience in confronting formidable drug trafficking organizations and other powerful nonstate armed actors (including paramilitaries and guerrillas) involved in the drug industry has transformed Colombian security forces, in particular the Colombian National Police, into an important reference in matters related to drug trafficking control and, more generally, the combating of organized crime. Working with both active members and retired officers, Colombia has cooperated with many countries in the region facing major challenges related to organized crime. The Colombian National Police has assisted its Mexican and Central American counterparts, offering training and sharing good practices and expertise in matters including surveillance, money laundering, and infiltration of drug syndicates. It has also collaborated with the Chilean police (Carabineros de Chile), sharing expertise on methods to combat organized crime\u2013related activities.\nRisks and opportunities ahead. While the stakes could not be higher and cooperation in combating transnational crime renders better results when there is coordination and information sharing among security services, the future of cooperation hinges on building higher levels of trust and developing joint partnerships, as well as on good governance. Furthermore, governments in the region are overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic, political polarization, social turmoil, corruption scandals, and the surge of violent protests, and thus have little room for dialogue and consensus on building a common security culture. Corruption and the penetration of organized crime in law enforcement agencies also pose serious risks that may shatter trust and undermine efforts. Likewise, collective action problems and free riding, especially in regard to obtaining foreign high-tech military equipment, may also undercut future cooperation. Most importantly, mistrust and outright rivalry between countries may create dangerous scenarios. The situation in the Venezuelan-Colombian border is a case in point. Connivance, cover ups, and even support for criminal groups operating in the area has transformed the border into one of the most dangerous areas in the region, where contraband, extortion, kidnappings, and cross-border operations on the part of security forces are daily occurrences. 63\nWhere do the opportunities lie? Because of the political realities on the ground, this is not a time for grand initiatives.64 It is time to think pragmatically and take small but solid steps. First, governments must start with their neighbors and set specific agendas on how to secure better governance of their border crossings. The pandemic is an incentive to move down this path. Second, the pandemic has also deepened the need for more and better digital information systems. This should boost bilateral collaboration in the exchange of sensitive data on violent insurgent groups, organized crime, smuggling, or human trafficking. Third, the socialization of good practices and successful strategies against organized crime might be particularly relevant in a region short on ideas on how to move beyond a punitive approach. Fourth, the region needs to think more and better about the nexus between technology and security. Like-minded states could establish bilateral or multilateral fora to examine, for instance, the risks that technological advances in communication (such as 5G networks) and surveillance (such as drones and cameras) could pose to regional security. Fifth, governments should work together in elaborating shared assessments on the transnational threats undermining security and good governance. This approach might reduce cognitive biases (like in-group/out-group thinking) and increase social trust among policymakers.\nWhy it matters. In the wake of Latin America\u2019s existing economic challenges, trade continues to have a role to play as an anchor of integration and an engine for economic growth and, more generally, of stability. Increased integration in international trade and global value chains may support economic growth and boost the region\u2019s productivity. Amid shifting preferences in economic policy, Latin America still needs to take active steps to embrace productivity growth. It also needs to strike the right balance between economic openness and policy space to uphold national rules.\nThe state of cooperation. Latin America has always exhibited a consistent gap between trade integration commitments and a piecemeal approach to put them into action. Summits are held, plans are designed and loosely implemented, but over time progress stagnates\u2014until a new cycle begins. The long-term result has therefore not been an upward trend but rather a disjointed pattern of integration. The number of trade agreements has increased significantly since the 1990s, and the region\u2019s weighted average tariffs declined markedly during the same period. But the progress made in trade liberalization seems to have stalled since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nThe region\u2019s rugged geography makes commercial integration difficult. Distances are vast, communication channels (navigable rivers, railroads, or binational routes) are scarce or nonexistent, and natural barriers such as the Andes Mountains or the Amazon Rainforest make any attempt at communication costly. Beyond geography, Latin American economies are not complementary and exhibit similar export patterns (based on livestock, crops, and mineral resources) and lack of diversification. China\u2019s transformation into a major consumption market for Latin American products has made this trend more apparent as countries have begun to compete to place their exports there. China is now the main export destination for Brazil, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and Uruguay, and is the second destination for Argentina and Colombia (see figure 4).\nChanging politics and interests in the region also have not been of much help. Governments in the region look at each other largely through ideological lenses, and the distance or closeness through that lens dictates much of their regional, if not global, policies. UNASUR is a case in point. The bloc was born out of a left-wing ideological approach, but a convergence on the right wing left it moribund. Bilateral dialogue between Argentina and Brazil is at its lowest point, in part because of the ideological distance between the right-wing Bolsonaro and the left-wing Peronist coalition led by Fern\u00e1ndez but also because of a lack of consensus about the need to eliminate the many exceptions that continue to dominate intra-Mercosur free trade. In the Andes region, there is little diplomatic dialogue between Venezuela and Colombia or between Ecuador and Venezuela; neither dialogue involves trade. Colombia\u2019s exports to Venezuela represented 9 percent of its total in 2000. In 2018, they reached barely 1 percent.\nIn sum, there is no central regulatory body for Latin America like Brussels is for the EU, nor are there regional trade hubs in terms of network centrality, like China in Asia or Germany in Europe. Instead, there are myriad arrangements, with different clusters exhibiting mixed results. Central America, together with Mexico, is more open and closely linked to trade dynamics with the United States. Mexico and Brazil, the two largest countries, are not central to a Latin American trade network, and the role they play as regional hubs remains limited to their closer neighbors. Tariff and nontariff barriers are especially high among countries on the Atlantic Ocean (see figure 5).\nRisks and opportunities ahead. For the first time in two centuries, Asia has a higher share of global GDP than the rest of the world combined. The changing global flow of trade, investment, and aid is a function of Asia\u2019s rise. Trade in services is growing faster than trade in goods, and automation is reducing the importance of labor costs. Value chains have become less trade-intensive and more knowledge-intensive, demanding more and more skilled labor. These chains are also becoming less global and more regional in their production, favoring proximity to demand, particularly in Europe and Asia. Offshoring might be replaced by variants of reshoring and nearshoring.65 As protectionism increases and global trade liberalization stagnates, the digital, local, and global are forced to interact in new ways. The advance of new technologies is reshaping our patterns of information, production, and consumption.\nLatin America has found it extremely difficult to develop a regional conversation on how to address this shifting dynamic. Most of these issues are off the political agenda and, when they do enter, do so through outdated notions of how capitalism should work. The positions range from the critical embracing of neoliberal policies to entirely protectionist standpoints. For countries whose economies have been able to grow from an active trade policy\u2014such as South Korea and Taiwan\u2014their basis of success was strong institutions and a combination of methods including export promotion, subsidies, investment regulations, and domestic content requirements.66 Today, however, these methods would infringe existing trade rules.\nThe global pandemic has accelerated new thinking on economic policies. Indeed, planning is back, and policymakers are rethinking a new mode of capitalism: stakeholder capitalism. Against this backdrop, Latin America needs to find the appropriate balance between economic openness and safety nets to smooth the adjustment process. It also needs to improve the environment in which trade operates, particularly infrastructure, information and communications technologies, transport service, connectivity, and the quality of ports. Customs procedures and border control should be simplified. Much cooperation is needed on regulatory issues, bilateral investment, trade facilitation, and the harmonization of rules of origin (see figure 6). In the same way, growing global concerns about sustainability and deforestation are a reality, and attacking them as undue meddling in internal affairs or as necessarily bad for business\u2014ideas promoted by Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro\u2014are unlikely to help the region. Rather, the focus should lie on how Latin America can use this new global context to its advantage and integrate sustainability into governments\u2019 overall economic strategies.\nThe Pacific Alliance, comprising Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, has signaled its aim to further integration, yet its internal trade ties are currently limited. As for Mercosur, the bloc needs to be reimagined (see figure 7). Dante Sica and Andr\u00e9s Malamud condemn it as \u201ca zombie [that] favors the stability of the presidents and symbolically pleases the peoples. But it does not create its own markets, it does not gain foreign markets, it does not provide prestige and it does not favor structural reforms. It must be transformed or it will sink into irrelevance.\u201d67 Brazil and Uruguay are pushing to modify Mercosur\u2019s rules. They would like, if necessary, to be able to sign agreements with third countries independently. \u201cWe need to find those flexibilities,\u201d said Ernesto Araujo, Brazil\u2019s former foreign minister, in February 2021.68 They also would like to see a gradual reduction of the bloc\u2019s Common External Tariff, an issue that has been long debated within the bloc. True, the common tariff, the cornerstone of a custom union, still is high, contains many exceptions, and undermines the competitiveness of the bloc. Yet trade politics is also domestic politics, and therefore contains much more than an economic rationale. Argentina and Brazil have so far been reluctant to alter entrenched trade-offs between protection, employment, and political support.\nWhy it matters. Democracy and the protection of human rights can promote peace, economic interdependence, and growth, as well their associated benefits. As the Venezuelan case suggests, the erosion of democracy can lead to political unrest, economic insecurity, human rights violations, and migrant flows that will affect neighboring countries. For all its shortcomings and problems, democratic rule has proven indispensable to addressing the manifold socioeconomic challenges and to improving good governance and the rule of law.69\nThe state of cooperation. From the 1990s onward, Latin America developed many new normative arrangements. Human rights and democracy were given priority and were protected and legalized at the regional level, with the OAS and other regional bodies signing democratic instruments. This was a story of convergence and mutually reinforcing patterns of democratization at the national level and cooperation at the regional level to develop democracy support mechanisms. Regional commitments have increased the costs of antidemocratic conduct, thereby serving as a deterrent for potential coup-makers. These commitments have also become venues to socialize ruling elites into democratic norms.\nDespite remarkable progress in building a normative framework in the realm of democracy and human rights, the region has not completely translated these principles into concrete and consistent actions to defend and promote democracy. (A partial exception is the Inter-American Human Rights system\u2014made of a commission and a court\u2014which has been a bulwark in the defense of democratic principles.) For a number of reasons, the OAS and other regional bodies have been selective and at times inconsistent in their reactions across democratic crises or human rights violations. First, the region lacks a clear metric to assess democracy, and thus there is no collective agency to monitor progress in this area. The OAS Charter can be more efficient when the interruption in democratic principles is abrupt and clear\u2014a coup, for example\u2014but not when the erosion of the democratic order involves a slow accumulation of antidemocratic decisions. The result has therefore been a low equilibrium between conceptual ambiguity and low institutional coercion. Existing regional mechanisms therefore have to deal with high levels of uncertainty about the nature and scope of norm violations, as was the case with presidential crises in Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru.\nSecond, the OAS\u2019s biased reaction often has been a function of conflicting member interests. This fragility has to do partly with social pressures and partly with institutional conflicts within democratic regimes, typically between the legislative or judicial branch and the executive branch. In Peru, for example, the instability lies in the relationship of the Congress\u2014empowered by the institution of vacancy\u2014and the executive branch.70 All these events were deeply entrenched in the legal and institutional design of the country concerned, which naturally has made any foreign intervention more challenging.\nThird, the existence of alternative regional venues has always been an incentive for states to practice \u201cforum shopping,\u201d in which they use the most convenient regional body either to increase external pressure on a target state or to take refuge in the norm of nonintervention. As a result, democratic charters of sorts have evolved more toward so-called anticoup norms that protect incumbents, rather than toward interventionist instruments condemning authoritarian regimes.\nFourth, both the OAS Commission and the Court on Human Rights are primarily reactive organizations, and they take their time to do so. Some cases may take up to ten years to reach the court. Having full-time judges, for example, would be very helpful. The other problem is funding. As an interviewee from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights remarked in December 2020, the court\u2019s budget does not exceed $7 million, and Nordic countries (for instance) contribute more to the OAS than 70 percent of the countries in the region that contribute directly as members.\nFinally, in recent years, the OAS human rights agenda has generated even more polarization by introducing into the commission and the court hot-button issues such as in vitro fertilization, marriage equality, and the rights of transgender persons. This polarization was present in 2016, when the commission faced its worst financial crisis and several states were willing to let it die. It also could be seen in 2019, when Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Paraguay demanded that the commission intervene less in their internal affairs. Polarization also was apparent in 2020 with the conflict over the reelection of Commission Executive Secretary Paulo Abrao\u2014which was vetoed by Almagro himself.\nOver the past ten years, a regional dialogue has been established through judicial bodies dealing with political issues. This dialogue, which is rarely visible, involves national courts, judges, judicial operators, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The result is a piecemeal but useful cooperation among courts, primarily at the technical level. One such case is that of the Brazilian company Odebrecht S.A., which has come to represent arguably the most important case of transnational corruption in South America and led to the Lava Jato investigation. While discredited in Brazil due to violations, investigations continue across the region. Latin America offered another interesting example in implementing the powers of the UN Convention Against Corruption. This convention facilitated direct action by prosecutors or judges without the need to involve governments. With this norm and a major case such as Lava Jato, formal and informal cooperation between judicial actors in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru, among countries, took place.\nBeyond these trends, courts in the Americas, Africa, and Europe have advanced in a permanent dialogue based on meetings and discussions of jurisprudence that generate reciprocal influences. There is a quiet integration of law, based on shared values, that is moving beyond political dialogue and has shaped the work of the UN, human rights committees, and special rapporteurs. It reveals a pattern: Political dialogue may be absent or polarized, but the technical or middle-management levels cooperate more closely than political radars can detect. State officials, agents of international organizations, and civil society organizations often try to move forward in low-profile, informal ways, seeking alternatives to the lack of concerted action among executives.\nRisks and opportunities ahead. The V-Dem Institute\u2019s annual assessment on the state of democracy warns about a worrisome trend toward democratic backsliding around the world.71 Similarly, the Economist Intelligence Unit report on the state of democracy worldwide shows that the average global democracy score in 2020 is the worst it has been since 2006.72 Latin America has not been immune to these trends (see figure 8). A sentiment of dissatisfaction with democracy has continued to grow. Since the end of the commodity boom in 2014, Latin America\u2019s economy has grown at an annual average of merely 0.8 percent.73 Citizens are thus seeing their demands for more education, jobs, healthcare, and quality public transport frustrated while a small part of the population sees their fortunes grow. The pandemic has only increased this frustration. Furthermore, citizens observe their governments\u2019 often fruitless struggles to reduce corruption levels. In Peru, the past six presidents have been imprisoned or prosecuted (and one committed suicide) due to corruption cases, almost all of which were linked to the Lava Jato investigation.\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the region\u2019s overall average score fell for a fifth consecutive year, from 6.13 in 2019 to 6.09 in 2020.74 El Salvador ceased to be a \u201cflawed democracy\u201d and became a \u201chybrid regime.\u201d Venezuela continued its authoritarian drift, and the Andean countries (except for Ecuador) saw their scores drop as well. The general sense is that the health crisis and economic obstacles will bring more polarization and fragmentation, and they will likely bring more outsiders or conflicts between legislators and executives. As Malamud observed, \u201cdemocratic stability requires a minimum threshold of economic redistribution at the bottom, social access in the middle and political pacts at the top.\u201d75\nThe decline of democracy and the worrisome levels of human rights violations across the region are, of course, domestic problems that regional cooperation cannot address alone. Yet it would be a mistake to believe that regional engagement does not matter. As mentioned above, outside influence occasionally has helped countries protect their democracies\u2014such as in Paraguay in 1996 and 1999, or during the political crisis that shook Bolivia in 2005 when the Media Luna region pushed for secession. Presidential leadership remains essential when democracy is at risk, but a lot can be done to prevent backsliding in the first place.\nThe international community can play a role in engaging Latin American countries with the goal to lock in key democratic processes and institutions via international institutions such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Mercosur, the OAS (despite its many shortcomings), the WHO, and the World Trade Organization.76 None of these institutions are problem free, but they are still better than nothing. Even when antidemocratic leaders find it popular and politically useful to attack them, these institutions remain crucial to shed light on violations that otherwise gain little visibility and help opposition leaders gain a regional platform.\nIn addition, because international institutions often react only after it is too late, the real bulwark against the decline of democracy in Latin America are the centers that produce knowledge or hold political power: independent media outlets and universities, an independent judiciary, a strong civil society, and an independent legislature. All of these bodies can constrain the executive, which is the greatest threat to democracy today. In countries across the region where democracy is under attack, courageous judges, reporters, academics, activists, and legislators are the backbone of political plurality and respect for human rights. The more these groups can cooperate across the region, the better, exchanging best practices and providing mutual support. The best outside institutions can often do is not to intervene directly\u2014which always carries the risk of being heavy-handed and counterproductive\u2014but to support independent regional networks that can constrain the executive, whether they are women\u2019s rights activists, investigative journalists, academics, or judges.\nWhy it matters. Crafting a response to growing tensions between Washington and Beijing is one of the most complex challenges for foreign ministries around the world. The same is true for Latin America, a region shaped by its geographic proximity to the United States, its growing economic dependence on China, and its aversion to longstanding alliances that limit strategic autonomy. One revealing example involves the issue of 5G technology. After being subject to diplomatic pressure from both the United States and China over the past few years, numerous Latin American governments will have to decide who will build their 5G cellular networks.77 In the process, it will be difficult to maintain the neutral posture traditionally preferred by most leaders in the region. Yet the debate around initial 5G building contracts is merely the starting point of a broader standoff. The United States and China are on track to build their respective technological spheres of influence with different technological standards not only for 5G, but also with regard to any technological innovations that follow, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Huawei has filed more standard essential patents for 5G than any other 5G-related company. And China submits more technical documents to the International Telecommunication Union\u2014which serves as the basis for debates about new standards\u2014than any other nation, a move seen as an attempt to internationalize its own standards and make its companies more competitive.78 In other areas, too, great powers will jockey for influence in Latin America, as China\u2019s \u201cvaccine diplomacy\u201d across the region has shown.79\nThe state of cooperation. There is an increasingly vibrant debate among scholars and diplomatic communities about how the region should react to the return of great power politics in Latin America. Yet particularly in areas such as 5G, the dialogue between governments has been limited. Some governments, such as Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador, have joined the United States\u2019s Clean Network Initiative, which seeks to isolate the Chinese telecommunications supplier Huawei; however, the majority of nations have chosen not to be so exclusive. In this sense, China has sought to compete with the United States in its own neighborhood.\nRisks and opportunities ahead. It is possible that the region\u2019s nations will opt to join different spheres, which could make their technologies largely incompatible further down the line. Latin America has already paid a heavy price for its inability to jointly tackle challenges, as raging transnational crime, refugee crises, and incoherent responses to political crises suggest. Yet the geopolitical toll of diverging 5G decisions could be greater still, creating irreversible obstacles to future regional cooperation. After all, a significant part of the global economy will be tied to new technologies\u2014from autonomous cars and drones used for transport and warfare to communication and global finance\u2014and all of them will be subject to the new rules of the emerging \u201ctech war.\u201d80\nOverall, it is undeniable\u2014and largely inevitable\u2014that China\u2019s influence in Latin America will grow. In the past four years, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Panama have formally recognized China. This shift has increased the number of votes that China can obtain for its appointees to international organizations (see figure 10). Beijing has developed strategic partnerships with 10 countries; it has free trade agreements with Chile, Costa Rica, Peru; and it is negotiating another with Panama. It is now a central partner for infrastructure development. Already, nineteen governments across Latin America and the Caribbean have joined Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion trade and infrastructure network. China also seeks to introduce technological standards in regional infrastructure (such as dams, railways, ports, and mobile infrastructure) and thus secure long-term customers.\nAs U.S. President Joe Biden is poised to reengage with Latin America, the challenges and obstacles from both the United States and the region will keep piling up. It is no secret that Biden\u2019s main concerns will revolve around how to fight COVID-19 and get the economy back on track. When it comes to foreign policy, China will be at the center of this nexus. The emerging conventional wisdom holds that the switch in the United States and China toward more assertive bilateral relationships will be particularly uncomfortable for Latin America.81 It is starting to divide the globe into competing spheres of influence and undermine the rules of the existing model of globalization.\nNumerous Latin American scholars have contributed to the debate about how the region should react to the return of great power politics. Esteban Actis and Bernab\u00e9 Malacalza put forward the concept of \u201cliquid autonomy\u201d and attempt to limit outside influence to some extent, cognizant of the fact that the region\u2019s strategic options are limited.82 Irrespective of how the debate will evolve, it will be better for it to take place on a regional level, if only to avoid complete regional fragmentation in the coming years. In other words, Latin America should avoid internalizing the widening divide between a rising China and an incumbent United States. The United States may have become less credible to follow, and China may have become too powerful to ignore, yet Latin America needs to find a delicate balance between values and interest. A principled pragmatism might be the best option.\nRegional cooperation in Latin America is facing its worst crisis since the wave of democratization in the 1990s. After several decades of remarkable progress, the region is now riven by division and a lack of political will to work together to tackle the numerous challenges that no single country can solve on its own. Current geopolitical trends, such as the tech war between Beijing and Washington, risk creating irreversible obstacles to greater regional cooperation in Latin America in the future. In addition, while some leaders\u2014such as those of Chile, Colombia, and Peru, which are part of the Pacific Alliance\u2014promote debates about how they can adapt to global trends, there is a near-complete absence of broader discussions between heads of state regarding the future of Latin America and its place in the world. The longer this scenario continues, the more difficult it will become to strengthen and promote regional governance and cooperation. Because rising policymakers currently are not being socialized into a regional network, they may well lack the personal contacts abroad necessary to quickly identify opportunities for cooperation.\nIt would be naive to disregard the numerous existing obstacles. Nevertheless, this paper reveals a series of areas where cooperation continues to function reasonably well in spite of the challenging political scenario. Rather than lament nonexistent cooperation at the very top or develop sweeping proposals that would not work with existing political realities, the best way forward will be to look carefully at the examples of functioning cooperation and apply their lessons to other areas where cooperation is currently lacking. The following 10 concrete ideas may help initiate a constructive dialogue on rekindling regional cooperation in Latin America.\nThese ten steps could lay, against all odds, the foundation for a revival of regional cooperation in Latin America and help mitigate the corrosive impact of populist ideology across the region. As Latin American governments take on the lasting damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, effective regional cooperation has never been more important.\nFederico Merke is an associate professor of international relations at the Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s, Argentina.

                    "value": "California has a habit of going up in flames on a yearly basis, leaving Cyberpunk-worthy scenes as a result. Why does this happen and where is it going is the topic of this post.\nThere is broad consensus in the scientific community that wildfire behavior is changing across the American West in general, and in California in particular. Figure 2.3 highlights trends in wildfire activity in California since 1990. All indicators shown\u2014wildfire occurrence, total area burned, and average fire size\u2014display an upward trend in the last several decades across the state (The Costs of Wildfire in California)\nFrom the chart below, it seems clear that there is an increasing trend in burned yearly acreage. Taking for example the worst 5 years in the period covered by the graph (67) years, they all take place in fairly recent years. But we should also note another peculiarity, that in any given year it is far from certain that, even with an overall increasing trend, one would observe a particularly bad year.\nIt didn't stop there, if we add the rest of the years until and including 2020, we get to the worst year ever. Note also that the distribution of fires per year is highly variable; there is an increasing number of fires and area burned per year, but this doesn't mean any given year is guaranteed to have many fires.\nMost investigators are unfamiliar with these historical fire records and are sometimes sceptical of their accuracy. For example, Stephens (2005) contended that USFS data before 1940 were inaccurate, but cited a source (Mitchell 1947) that provided no evidence of this. Likely, the idea comes from Donoghue\u2019s (1982b) comment \u20181940 marked the modern era of fire reporting\u2019. However, that comment was in reference to the fact that \u2018the report issued at this time was the first designed for automated data processing and easy readability\u2019 and was not in reference to reliability. Historians have generally been confidant in these early California fire records (Brown 1945; Show 1945; Clar 1969; Cermak 2005). The first author, J. E. Keeley, examined all of the California fire-related materials stored at the state and federal archives and believes collectively they show managers have always been conscientious about reporting accuracy and completeness. For example, beginning in 1905, USFS recordkeeping required 15 items of information on the fire reporting Form 944, including the specific cause (Donoghue 1982b). On state-protected lands there was an incentive in that the 1911 Federal Weeks Law provided fiscal aid to states based on statistics of fire protection (see http://www.calfire.ca.gov/ about/about_calfire_history2, accessed 23 May 2018).\nIn 1919, the California state legislature appropriated money for fire prevention and suppression, and records in the state archive show that, by 1920, there were more than 400 fire wardens distributed throughout the state who were charged with firefighting and fire reporting. In 1920, there were 800 flights of the Army\u2019s 9th Aero Squadron fire patrol that covered 426 500 km during the 5-month California fire season (Cermak 1991).\nRegarding even older fire areas inferred from fire scarring, it's an imperfect metric for multiple reasons: trees may not have scars even if they burned, trees may all just die and not leave a trace of the fire, and the composition of a given forest may have changed: if one finds a handful of trees with fire scars, is that a small fire, or was that part of a larger fire but where the rest of the forest died? Then one is forced to turn to statistical techniques to correct for these factors. There are some studies that aim to measure how well looking at fire scars correlate with the written record for old fires (Fule et al., 2003). This is what the correlation for the written record and fire scar-derived data (by two different methods) looks like, showing reasonable agreement in one area studied over the period 1937-2000 (Farris et al., 2010; for a less optimistic view, Shapiro-Miller 2007, though here it seems to be a lack of good written records rather than fire-scars being wrong),\nSatellite data matches ground-based data as well, although we can only see this for more recent data when we have satellite imagery (Soja et al., 2006).\nThere are some that argue that this is not because of climate change based on the extended record of yearly burned acreage. The plot above only goes back to 1950. The data they point to there is indeed real: The National Interagency Fire Center did say that fires were at its very worst back a century ago, getting better until perhaps all the way to 1996. In fact, even with the chart above, if one squinted at the 1950-1996 data, one might still conclude that it is trending down. The original source of the data caveats the figures with Prior to 1983, sources of these figures are not known, or cannot be confirmed, and were not derived from the current situation reporting process. As a result the figures prior to 1983 should not be compared to later data.\nThe same trend can be glanced in Figure 21 from Syphard & Keeley (2016), a review of various long-run wildfire data sources. The authors do not dispute the underlying data (i.e. they agree that there is no secular increasing trend).\nThis finding is surprising because it is often heard that climate change is leading to an increase in wildfires. But if there is no increase, then maybe climate change doesn't have much of an impact here? That is, are we living through a period with an unusually low amount of fire and what we're seeing now is a return to normal?\nThis is a position held by some like Michael Shellenberger, see here, here, and especially here. He points to other factors driving the recent increase in fires, especially fire suppression, or rather fire exclusion: the practice (that I will discuss later) of not allowing any fire in the environment, which leads to the accumulation of fuels, and larger fires years later. Shellenberger has many things right but the overall message is wrong, there is enough evidence that climate change is a key player in the wildfire situation in California. More on this later.\nAnother factor others point to is a substantial increase in housing construction in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), which is mentioned by a scientist cited in the piece (Keeley) leading to more fires. More people living near wildland areas means also more roads (vehicles are a nontrivial source of ignitions), more powerlines, more campfires (easier to go camping when nature is close to home), and more accidents that can lead to fire in general.\nYet another factor that modulates the role of climate on wildfires (Keeley & Syphard, 2019), in the short term at least, is that higher rainfall in one year leads to more fires the next (more vegetation grows). Indeed the \"wettest\" year in California ever far (2016-2017) was followed by intense fires (2018).\nAnd in turn these periods of higher or lower rainfall may be driven by natural oscillations in the climate (like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or the related Atlantic Multidecadal oscillation). A paper from 2007, Kitzberger et al. noted that A current warming trend in AMO suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades., which is precisely what happened.\nIf one wanted to see how much of the trend is attributable to climate change one would have to model those oscillations (and control away the impact of human activities like forest management). Most such analyses use data from 1950 onwards, like Abatzoglou & Williams (2016). Nothing wrong with that! That time period should cover a chunk of cold and warm Pacific Decadal oscillations, but ideally we'd like to see a model that reconstructs the entire observed dataset of fires. Be that as it may, what the authors find is that half2 of the increase in aridity of the fuels present in US forests (and presumably, California) was due to anthropogenic climate change, with the rest being natural variation (possibly the oscillations described earlier). In turn, aridity is strongly correlated with burned area in a given year,\nNote that the Abatzoglou et al. paper does not account for a long list of effects, including human activity preventing or fighting fires, and this list contains causes that could both increase or decrease the fraction of wildfires attributable to climate change.\nIn focusing exclusively on the direct impacts of ACC on fuel aridity, we do not address several other pathways by which ACC may have affected wildfire activity. For example, the fuel aridity metrics that we used may not adequately capture the role of mountain snow hydrology on soil moisture. Nor do we account for the influence of climate change on lightning activity, which may increase with warming (40). We also do not account for how fire risk may be affected by changes in biomass/fuel due to increases in atmospheric CO2 (41), drought-induced vegetation mortality (42), or insect outbreaks (43). Additionally, we treat the impact of ACC on fire as independent from the effects of fire management (e.g., suppression and wildland fire use policies), ignitions, land cover (e.g., exurban development), and vegetation changes beyond the degree to which they modulate the relationship between fuel aridity and forest fire area. These factors have likely added to the area burned across the western US forests and potentially amplified the sensitivity of wildfire activity to climate variability and change in recent decades (2, 22, 24, 44). Such confounding influences, along with nonlinear relationships between burned area and its drivers (e.g., Fig. 1), contribute uncertainty to our empirical attribution of regional burned area to ACC. Our approach depends on the strong observed regional relationship between burned area and fuel aridity at the large regional scale of the western United States, so the quantitative results of this attribution effort are not necessarily applicable at finer spatial scales, for individual fires, or to changes in nonforested areas.\nFour metrics were calculated from monthly data for 1948\u20132015: (i) reference potential evapotranspiration (ETo), (ii) VPD, (iii) CWD, and (iv) Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). The other four metrics are daily fire danger indices calculated for 1979\u20132015: (v) fire weather index (FWI) from the Canadian forest fire danger rating system, (vi) energy release component (ERC) from the US national fire danger rating system, (vii) McArthur forest fire danger index (FFDI), and (viii) Keetch\u2013 Byram drought index (KBDI).\nAs an aside, if we pick one of them, like vapor pressure deficit, we get the same results.\nVPD measures the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air could potentially hold when it\u2019s saturated.It\u2019s often measured in pounds per square inch (psi) or kilopascal (kPa).A high VPD (greater than 1.0 kPa) means that the air can still hold a large amount of water. High VPD means that rather than droplets of water staying on or in plants, they will be sucked up into the air (warmer air can carry more water), thus high VPD leads to drier terrains and drier terrains leads to, in general, more fire. VPD also correlates reasonably well with burned area across the Western United States in general and California specifically (Higuera & Abatzoglou, 2020, Park Williams et al. 2019). The relationship seems exponential: More VPD, exponentially more fires.:\nIt won't be too surprising to say that VPD is going up as temperatures rise, but also note that it also presents an oscillatory component (black) that is not well captured by the CMIP5 climate model ensemble (red). This oscillation may help explain why there were so many fires pre 1950, why there was so little fire in the intermediate years, and why there is so much fire now. Eyeballing the period of the oscillation, it may be caused by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. If so, we may have reached a peak and will get some rest from the rising trend from a few years, but given the underlying rising trend from climate change, that won't be more than a temporary slowdown of the increase rather than an absolute respite:\nNote that the correlation should break down at sufficiently high VPDs: once a lot of California has burned, that naturally delays the occurrence of further fires.\nCalifornia is indeed getting more dry over the years even when considering data going back more than 100 years which should cancel our periodic oscillations: there remains a trend towards dryness.,\nSo climate change is acting in the expected direction: California is getting warmer and drier and these two, by virtue of the thermodynamics of combustion will lead to, ceteris paribus, more fire in the future. Note that effect is true in general but not always. While drier fuels burn more, if the weather is sufficiently arid, plants will just stop growing: in the very extreme case, that's a reason why the Sahara desert doesn't see much fire activity despite it being an extremely hot and dry place. Later on I discuss a study that finds this dynamic in a specific area of California.\nI also created an animated version which helps to emphasize how weather conditions during California's fire season have evolved over time. #CaliforniaFires #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/gkuRrdn2ZG\nAs I mentioned earlier, a key point of the \"it's not climate change\" argument is that there used to be substantially more fire in the pre-1800s past than there is now.\nIn 2020 around 4.4M acres burned which was considered to be the most acres ever burned in the record. And indeed it is, unless we go before 1950. If we do that, going all the way pre-1800, we find that the average acres that burn in any given year is 1.8M hectares, or around 4.4M acres (Stephens et al., 2007). This average is equal to the worst year ever in recent history, so one could tell a story here of California returning to normal after a period of trying to fight the inevitable (the climate-given steady state of burned acres per year). Should we tell this story? Michael Shellenberger goes for that, where the rarity is not the recent uptick in fires, but the anomalously low amount of burns that preceded the current era, fruit of a century of aggressively fighting fires, which leads to overgrown forests, creating more fuel for fires to spread. This wouldn't mean that climate change is not contributing to the effect, increased temperatures and aridity would contribute to an increase in that steady state of burned acres per year, it's just that we are now being pulled back from an unsustainably low level. Shellenberger goes as far as saying that we should probably stop blaming climate change for the fires. As I hope my discussion above clarifies, climate change is playing a role.\nThere's more to pre-1950 fire records than the 1800s data. That was also an era of building railroads, burning forests to clear up land for farming, and having less knowledge of firefighting or even having means to suppress some of those fires. We should go even further into the past, and there's some work doing that: Marlon et al. (2011) say that considering even longer time scales while there was a peak in fire activity centered in ~1890 that wasn't the situation all the way into the past. Prior to that there was, it is true, more fire than there is now, but not as much as that intermediate era.\nMarlon et al. note that there is, as of the date of writing the paper, a \"fire deficit\" (noted also by Baker, 2015) relative to what one would expect from historical climatic patterns: not enough is burning. A decade later, we're perhaps now seeing how that gap is being closed by means of the most damaging fire seasons ever.\nThis fire deficit is even more striking if one plots (as Marlon et al. did, in the supplement) the historical record of predicted charcoal influx (a proxy for fire) using climate and the observed record,\nIf curious about that \"Reynolds and Pierson (1941)\" reference there for historical fires, I managed to track down something that claims to be a scanned text of that. It contains this figure, which should be the figure \"A\", stretched over a longer axis. How much should we trust this? I don't know! It contains causes of tree destruction other than fire, but converting board feet per decade to acres is not trivial. At say 5-15k board feet per acre, the surface burned in the 1600s might have been between 1.3 and 4 million acres per year (this latter being closer to the figure from Stephens earlier so the order of magnitude checks out).\nThough perhaps some of that bump is not real, but rather prescribed fire (or woods clearing) done illegally (albeit in a controlled fashion) that the Forest Service would regardless classify as wildfire.\nTypically most of the damage caused by wildfire is due to a handful of fires (Strauss et al., 1989); in the 2020 California wildfire season, the aggregated 38 fires that comprised the August Fire Complex burned almost a quarter of the entire surface area that burned that year, despite those 38 fires being just 0.38% of the 9917 fires reported during 2020. This particular fire was due to lightning storms. The same is true for the rest of the mega fires of 2020, the SCU Lightning Complex, LNU Lightning Complex, North Complex, or SQF Lightning Complex.\nBut we should remember that what matters is not necessarily what starts the most fires, but rather what leads to the most damage.\nAccording to Cal FIRE, 6 out of the top 20 most destructive fires (by structures burned and deaths) were due to faulty powerlines. Some of the other ones are due to trivial incidents as in the Carr fire case where Coincidental to the name of the incident, the fire was started when a flat tire on a vehicle caused the wheel's rim to scrape against the asphalt, creating sparks that set off the fire. Or the Valley fire where a wire at a poorly connected hot tub overheated, melted and ignited dry brush nearby at a home in Cobb town. Or the Mendocino fire where the [Ranch] Fire was started by a rancher who had inadvertently sparked dry grass while hammering a metal stake while trying to find a wasp nest.\nThus, from a prevention side, whereas there is a long tail of potential causes of fire that are hard to control, maintaining or under grounding powerlines is the one thing that could be done to reduce the most devastating of fires in terms of human lives and damaged structures.\nOn the other hand if we care about acres burned the thing to do is worry about lightning-started fires, and we should care about this because it's likely that the structures that burned+deaths approach to quantifying damage underestimates the true costs of wildfires. One would have to add the economic costs of individual wildfire mitigation (buying air purifiers), the inability to enjoy the relevant natural areas (from which many derive great value), or the damage from millions of people breathing polluted air. Acreage should not be \"the\" metric to reduce (as suggested here), but it is still a major part of the equation. To make the point more clear, there is work attempting to quantify the impact of wildfire-produced air pollution on health; Wang et al. (2021) estimate that the California wildfires of 2018 alone, via increases in mortality risk, caused the death of 3652 people which is 35x more than the lives lost directly due to the fires3. This is a very important point: this kind of indirect damage due to pollutants is not always considered in cost-benefit analyses of the wildfire equation: The National Fire Protection Association, which is often quoted as an authority for cost of wildfires does not include health-related costs in their calculations. Or the wikipedia cost calculation figure the 2018 wildfires cites a 26.35bn$ loss whereas the Wang et al. paper, adding in health losses and indirect (counterfactual loss of economic activity) losses has a total of 148.5bn$. Chapter 5 of this has an extensive review of the effects of wildfires on health. The reason why this might be is that it's easier to notice that the damage is there (a burning building is easier to see than inflamed lungs) and assigning a value to rebuilding a building is easier than modeling the cost of that particulate matter getting into people's lungs. Fortunately, this is starting to be acknowledged and the California's Wildfire and Forest Resilience and Action plan has a section on reducing the health effects of smoke (p.34). The Cost of Wildfire in California (2020) report considers health effects as well.\nThis is a very basic understanding of the issue, but one that gets us to a more informed level than this PBS article that claims that 95% of fires are due to human causes. That may be the case, but most of fires are small and irrelevant, what we care about is causes, weighted by seriousness: fires caused by lightning strikes still should be a major cause of concern.\nMany people in California live in the so-called Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). I recently took a trip up to Larkspur (Marin County) to do some research. This is what the WUI might look like at that particular place,\nFirst, there's the point that new construction at the WUI has been increasing rapidly increasing both the damage caused to humans (hard to have wildfires in tree-less San Francisco) because of urban dwellers being pushed out of cities due to increasing house prices as well as increased odds that human activity will cause more fires. This point is correct.\nSecond, as a prescriptive measure resulting from the above diagnosis, there are calls for moving people out of the WUI. A few of the fires I mentioned earlier started here: the faulty hot tub that started the Valley Fire is another example of WUI. More people, more chances someone does something that could start a fire. Having more people near forests also requires having more electric lines (that for cost reasons tend to be built overground) which can also lead to accidental fires. To me the key issue is not whether people expose themselves to risks to their person and property by building there; rather the issue is that they are exposing others to huge risks by being there.\nI am very reluctant to try to get people out of the WUI. As you can see from the linked StreetViews, WUIs are a great place to live! Depriving some of that opportunity to save California is for now a false dilemma: progress means not having to make tradeoffs and it may be that we can have our WUI cake and eat it as well.\nThere is a way out of this: Insurance. If people living in the WUI are both a major cause of fires as well as victims, can't insurance solve the problem? Higher premia would dissuade people from moving there, and -in a more extreme case worth exploring- could shift the responsibility of paying for causing the damage from the State to the insurers and through them, to the potential culprits, the same way it is done for nuclear reactors or cars. Mandatory third-party insurance, perhaps baked into location-dependent property taxes for wildfires would be a solution.\nThe closest we have, or rather used to have, to this is the CAL FIRE fee levied on habitable buildings in state land that are not incorporated. The problem with this fee is twofold: one, it's the same for everyone (unlike regular insurance), where higher risk areas should be charged a higher premium. Second, it doesn't apply to everyone! While hot tub owners of Cobb would be paying it, those of South Lake Tahoe would not.\nThe insurance mechanism on the victim side (paying those that suffer from wildfire damage) is sadly broken due to government regulation. What should happen is that premia should increase in areas prone to fire which in turn help dissuade new construction there on the margin. The California government, for example prevents insurers from dropping coverage in wildfire-prone areas. Where they can, insurers are in fact dropping customers. Why would insurers want to drop valuable customers? Because again the California government doesn't let them increase premia to actuarially fair levels: they have to ask for permission to raise them. Instead of a free market where insurers compete to fairly price risk, the imposition of price caps leads to the absence of service. There's a state-operated insurer of last resort, the FAIR plan which fortunately offers less comprehensive coverage than the private plans (So it ends up being expensive; perhaps not as expensive as it should be, but better than it would be if it were more comprehensive). Of course, California being California, the plan is to move in that direction, in effect offering a subsidy to those living in fire-prone areas.\nAnother potentially easy solution is to have building standards that enforce so called defensible space around the house, clearing up vegetation around the building, or building using fire-resistant materials (Sure we get it timber is cheap but concrete blocks are not that expensive4). Unfortunately again California is California: Whereas in San Francisco crime is de facto legal, current construction codes already ask for house builders to build houses in a reasonable way to reduce damage from fire and for owners to upkeep those standards. But if you look at any WUI area lots of people just don't do that. This is a broader theme in California: there is a gap between instituting laws and action plans and actually getting those executed. In any case, even when complied with, one could always demand even more restrictive standards here.\nThe creation of defensible space around a property, according to specific horizontal and vertical spacing criteria, is required by state law in State Responsibility Areas and in High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Local Responsibility Areas, and/or by local ordinance. The specific requirements for defensible spaces are found in the Public Resources Code 4290- 4294 within California Building Code: Chapter 7A. Amendments to the CA building code in 2005, 2008 (SB 1595 Kehoe, Chapter 366, Statutes of 2008) and 2018 (AB 2911 Friedman, Chapter 641, Statutes of 2018) provided major updates to the code that increased defensible space requirements, including increasing the defensible space up to 100 feet and requiring more intense fuel management within the first 30 feet around a structure. State law applies fines of no less than $100 for a first infraction, increasing to a potential misdemeanor charge and a fine of no less than $500 for a third infraction. State law also allows insurance carriers to require more restrictive defensible space criteria than the 100-foot criteria in California\u2019s building code. **There is no statewide audit of defensible space compliance with the state requirement and anecdotal evidence suggests compliance is uneven. **(The Cost of Wildfire in California)\nIt wouldn't be a Nintil post without some plots. I took data from the Fire Perimeters database from CAL FIRE and plotted the area burned, the number of fires and so forth, divided by cause. The notebook used to generate the figures is available at the Open Nintil repository.\nNote that this dataset focuses on the largest fires and not all fires so the figures for number of fires or acres burned must be interpreted with the caveat \"by large fires\". The difference between FRAP and other data sources is documented in Syphard & Keeley 2016, though 5 years have passed since that so possibly FRAP data is now more up to date. I checked a few years with other datasets like this and the numbers roughly add up.\nRegarding some of these trends; is is that we are seeing more lightning, or that the same amount of lightning is striking more arid fuels, leading to more fire? We know the latter is true, is the former true? Seemingly not, the amount of lightning (at least in the 1985-2000 period) has remained constant (van Wagtendonk & Cayan, 2008). It may be that lightning is overall increasing, but at least that period is evidence that we can see increasing lightning-caused fires without lightning itself being the variable that's driving it. This is not to rule out that lightning strikes are trending up in general (or in the 2000-2021) period.\nIs the same the case for the human causes? Trying to disentangle that is harder because lightning is a discrete event whereas human factors include fire suppression, urban construction, roads, or power lines. Mann et al. (2016) tried to disentangle these relative contributions and find that even after controlling away the effect of climate change, on net human activity has still contributed to more fire.\nIn these maps, red represents human-started fires after 2000. Blue represents fires of unknown cause. Green represents fires due to natural (i.e. lightning) causes:\nStarrs et al. (2018) have a convenient chart showing who owns what, and importantly, who is responsible for fighting fires where. In State areas, it will be CALFIRE doing the firefighting whereas for federal land it'll be firefighters from any of the agencies that manage the relevant land:\nOur results clearly demonstrate that non-federal lands have seen far less of an increase in fire probability than have federal lands. Our results also showed a consistent pattern of lands with federal firefighting\u2014regardless of ownership or reserve status\u2014nearly always having a higher fire probability than lands with state firefighting\nLands for which the State and Federal Agencies are responsible for wildland fire protection are intermingled and/or adjacent in some areas, and wildland fires on these lands may present a threat to the lands of the other.\nIt is to the mutual advantage of the Agencies to this Agreement to coordinate efforts in the investigation, prevention, detection and response to wildland fire, and projects related to fuels management including prescribed fire in and adjacent to their areas of responsibility. This improves efficiency and effectiveness and limits duplication.\nAnd institutes a bunch of cross-agency entities, mainly the California Wildland Fire Coordinating Group which is the closest California have to a single entity in charge for the entire territory. The agreement effectively pools all firefighting resources into a single loosely held coalition. However what it does not do is to effectively unify forest management practices across agencies. This is why, if an agency runs out of money for prevention activities, firefighters from another can't just jump in to do their job in their stead,\nSo real work on the ground to reduce the intensity of fires isn't getting done or is being delayed,\" says Ken Pimlott, the director of Cal Fire. \"It really just further exacerbates the intensity of fires because we can't get on the federal ground in particular to get the fuels treated.\nTo make it worse, tree NIMBYism is a thing, and so proposed activities to manage a forest (e.g. prescribed burns) often face opposition;\nCreating solutions is complicated by the array of overseers of wildlands \u2014 a tangle of federal, state and local agencies and thousands of private owners. A permit to cut or burn any parcel might stall if public officials can\u2019t answer concerns about air quality, water purity, wildlife preservation and cultural and historical preservation.\nAn Environmental Impact Statement and Decision Notice were released in May of 2001. The project was subsequently appealed. At the appeals resolution meeting, eight individual landowners requested the appellants withdraw their appeal, which they did not. The project decision was upheld in August of 2001. The appellant filed a complaint with Federal District Court to permanently enjoin the project which was granted. A hearing date was set for October of 2003; however in July of 2003 approximately 45% of the project area burned in a running crown wildfire. The chronology (Exhibit 2) of this project shows how process and procedural delays hamper the ability to get on top of forest health restoration needs especially when treatment needs are time sensitive. Often delay is the objective of individuals or groups that do not want to see any trees harvested.\nThe image below, taken from the California Public Utilities Commission shows historically where fires in California have occurred. Hover over the image to see areas deemed to be of high risk. They largely match and with the exception of the Central Valley (which is basically a relatively humid area literally tiled with farms) the entirety of California is at risk.\nThere are not good records of the distant past in the US in general or California specifically. But there might be for other countries. Canada shows a declining number and area of wildfires over the years after an increasing trend culminating in the 90s. Like the US, Canada engaged in a policy of fire suppression up until the 70s, but maybe they transitioned more aggressively to prescribed burns? Spain (Urbieta et al., 2019; Montiel-Molina et al. 2019) and the Mediterranean region more broadly are seeing less fire despite increase risk of fire (due to better management techniques), but not in Australia (Where there's an upward trend in some areas that's partially but not fully due to climate change).\nGlobally, there is a trend towards fewer, but larger fires (Doerr & Santin, 2016). The concluding section, in line with the \"fire deficit\" idea from earlier is worth quoting at length because back then they make the claim that there was no trend: and that may have been true once but not anymore (the article was written in 2016).\nFew studies exist that have explicitly examined trends in fire severity. These have mainly focused on the western USA, an area where there are particular concerns about increased fire activity [42,70]. Examining trends from 1984 to 2006 for large ecoregions in the north- and southwest USA, Dillon et al. [71] found no significant increase in the proportion of annual area burned at high severity for five of the six regions considered, with the southern Rockies being the exception. For the Sierra Nevada region (California), which was not covered in the previous study [71], Hanson & Odion [72,73] found no general increase in fire severity within the period 1984\u20132010. Considering ten national forests in California for the same period, Miller & Safford [74] found a significant increase in burn severity for yellow pine\u2013mixed conifer forests. They attribute this largely to decades of fire suppression and other management practices rather than climate, which have led to major changes in forest composition and structure, increases in density and fuel-loading, and hence fire behaviour. Covering the much larger area of the dry forest landscapes of the western USA, including large parts of those examined in the aforementioned studies, Baker [75] found that the rate of high-severity fire in the period 1984\u20132012 was within or below that of historical century- to millennial-scale estimates.\nThus, while there is evidence of a recent increase in proportional fire severity for a specific forest type in California, these independent studies do not support the notion of an overall increase in fire severity over the past few decades in the fire-adapted forested landscapes in the western USA. Indeed, a longer term perspective focused on the Californian Sierra Nevada and Cascades by Mallek et al. [49] suggests that the annual area burned at high severity between 1984 and 2009 was only half that prior to European settlement (approx. 1500\u20131850), associated with an overall smaller area burned compared to pre-European times. Whether or not the overall lack of change in burn severity applies also to other regions where perceptions of increases in fire severity exist too has to remain unanswered until robust data emerge to test this notion.\nThe set of activities that have as a goal extinguishing fires called fire suppression. Fire exclusion on the other hand the a policy putting off all fires as fast as possible, and not starting any new fires. By default wildfires would burn until it there is no more fuel to burn but this is not ideal as all that fire can generate pollution, and loss of life and property. So it seems natural to want to suppress every single fire. Fire is kind of scary and hard to control.\nBut this is one of the Talebian cases where systems require some volatility to stay more stable than otherwise. It is now commonly agreed that such policies (fire exclusion) are bad: they allow for too much fuel to accumulate, leading to larger and more devastating fires.\nAfter a series of large fires in 1910 the US decided it had gotten enough of that and aimed to prevent any and all fires from ever happening. In 1935 a policy was instituted such that every fire should be suppressed by 10 a.m. the day following its initial report. Why even fight wildfires in the first place? It was not so much safety or health concerns, but an economic one: burnt forests are not forests you can profit from by logging them. Now that logging and wood-related activities are a minor part (~1%) of California's GDP (39 billion/ 3 trillion) this justification is weaker, compared to the other considerations (like health and protecting life and property).\nIn 1970 a reversal of these policies started, and now the consensus position is that starting some fires is can be a valuable tool (Stephens & Ruth, 2005).\nThat maximum protection or fire exclusion inevitably increases hazard by the encouragement of undergrowth is, of course, true, but such added hazard in no way vitiates the reasons for protection. It is an additional danger, but one that can willingly be accepted. (Show & Kotok, 1924; see also Keeley, 2021 who notes that part of the reason the policy was put into place seems to be some amount of lobbying by the logging industry: burnt trees are less valuable)\nBut despite official proclamations that prescribed fire is okay now, it still seems to be not as practiced as most reports say it should. I guess because changing firefighting culture takes more than saying 'We have a different culture now'.\nShortly after the NPS revised its fire policy, the USFS did so as well. Henry Debruin, Director of Fire and Aviation Management for the USFS, stated \u2018\u2018we are determined to save the best of the past as we change a basic concept from fire is bad to fire is good and bad\u2019\u2019 (DeBruin 1974:12). While this statement represented a major shift in the philosophy of the USFS, fire suppression was still to dominate agency policy for the coming decades (Franklin and Agee 2003). (Stephens & Ruth, 2005)\nEven in 2020, one can still find articles talking about bottlenecks in further pursuing this policy (Miller et al., 2020). Not only California is not doing enough prescribed burns, but it's not even doing the ones that are planned (dashed line is planned, black is actual). At least it's trending up:\nBut the 30k acres burned in 2018 are not enough: The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimated in 2010 that 20 million acres would require treatment. Even when upping the yearly burn to 100k acres per yer it would still take 200 years to get all the burning done. The number Miller et al. actually call for is 1.01 million a year, which is substantial, around 20% of the total surface that burned in the 2020 wildfires.\nSo what's preventing California from reaching that target? Miller et al. asked a range of stakeholders:\nIn any one given year, a firefighting agency has to allocate resources between fighting fires and preventing them. In some platonic scenario, one models what's going to happen by doing each activity and how that affects fire hazard over time, and allocates resources accordingly.\nThis is not how agencies operate in reality. For example CAL FIRE has no choice but to extinguish any and all fires under its area of responsibility regardless of any other consideration, the only real constraint being firefighting crew availability. The crews that do prevention also do suppression and with a lengthening fire season, the money and crews that would otherwise be preparing for the next season are fighting the current one. The firefighting trap (Moreira et al., 2020) is the situation that happens when fighting fires in the short term, at the expense of disregarding prevention and preparation for future fires, yields an increasing amount of fire. Breaking this cycle of self-defeating firefighting practices would involve potentially politically hazardous actions, like modifying CAL FIRE's charter to allow them not to intervene in wildfires, or even not to intervene by default unless there fire is predicted to cross a certain threshold of expected damage. Savings from this policy would allow prevention activities to take place more often. More realistically, CAL FIRE should have a ring-fenced budget for one and other kinds of activities, but even then, is it politically acceptable to have some crews working unmolested on prevention projects while other crews are desperate for reinforcements miles away, trying to save lives? The temptation to shift resources to suppression activities is always there.\nA point I encountered repeatedly is that Native Americans were engaging in prescribed burns before it was cool the arrival of Europeans to America. There seems to be some political coding around prescribed fires, where \"prescribed fires is how to solve the problem, the government made it worse\" is the conservative position and \"actually, wildfires are due to climate change\" is the progressive position.\nAdding that \"Native Americans were doing it\" may be an attempt to make the position sound more progressive and natural sounding or something (where prescribed fire is a return to ancestral practices). Be that as it may, were they really?\nNative Americans indeed used fire for various reasons, from religious to clearing land to increasing agricultural yield to reducing places where rival tribes could hide and ambush (Keeley, 2002). But the extent to which these practices affected large swathes of territory remains debated. For what's worth Keeley does think that the practices did lead to substantial amounts of fire, enough to shape large parts of the region.\nOther ecological effects of burning and other traditional management practices that are apparent today may not have been so obvious or primary in the world of the Native Americans. The beneficial effects of understory and spot burning in several forest types as a preventive to wildfires, disease outbreaks, and extensive forest burns, now so apparent to Northwest forest managers, have become timely because of the ill-advised, unnatural (and culturally specific) practice of fire suppression\nI'm agnostic as whether these practices were enough to substantially alter the landscape of California at large. Ultimately I think of the practice of prescribed burning as aiming not to give the environment what it \"naturally needs\"; nature does not do prescribed burning, rather it's an attempt to first undo what the longstanding fire suppression policy (also an alteration over the natural course of things) did, and make California a more livable place than what nature would let us have: maybe more fires, but in safer ways with less pollution and damage.\nThere is only a handful of paper trying to consider climate change and fire exclusion jointly. Hanan et al. (2021) examine two different locations (Johnson Creek and Trail Creek) in Idaho using the most detailed model of coupled hydrology-fire-ecology-climate that I've seen so far (RHESSys-WMFire) and... it's complicated. Fire exclusion (zero-tolerance policy against fire) can both worsen and improve the number and area of fires. And the same is true for climate change! This latter result is because while increasing aridity makes for more flammable fuels, at some point of increased aridity (and for a given vegetation type), the growth rate of new vegetation is stunted and so one gets less fires.\nFire regimes\u2014characterized by the frequency, intensity, size, season, and severity of fire over time\u2014 exist along an aridity continuum that ranges from being limited by flammability (i.e. climate) to being limited by fuel (Krawchuk and Moritz 2011, Pausas and Paula 2012). In climate-limited systems, there is typically enough fuel for fire to spread, but moisture is too high; these systems are characterized by infrequent, severe fires, which occur during unusually arid conditions. In fuel-limited systems, the climate is relatively arid and conducive to fire, so fire activity is mostly driven by the amount of live and dead plant material present; these systems typically experience frequent, low-severity surface fires.\nCould it then be that the \"fire deficit\" is actually caused by climate change, rather than fire exclusion? This is very unlikely: If California as a whole were at the point the vegetation-reducing effect of aridity overwhelms the fire-inducing effect we would see an inverse correlation between aridity and fire in the last few decades; but the Abatzoglou et al. papers cited above show otherwise: Right now more aridity means more fire.\nHere I have reviewed various strands of evidence regarding what's going on with wildfires in California and where it is going. I have explicitly not gone into what should we do about the matter, that will come in part 2 of this series. To sum up, this is what is going on:\nThe post was getting somewhat long so I've left some interesting questions unexplored here."

As the number of Indian-origin residents in the United States has swelled north of 4 million, the community\u2019s diversity too has grown.\nToday, Indian Americans are a mosaic of recent arrivals and long-term residents. While the majority are immigrants, a rising share is born and raised in the United States. Many Indian immigrants might have brought with them identities rooted in their ancestral homeland, while others have eschewed them in favor of a nonhyphenated \u201cAmerican\u201d identity. And despite the overall professional, educational, and financial success many Indian Americans enjoy, this has not inoculated them from the forces of discrimination, polarization, and contestation over questions of belonging and identity.\nThere is surprisingly little systematic data about the everyday social realities that Indian Americans experience. How do Indian Americans perceive their own ethnic identity? How do they respond to the dual impulses of assimilation and integration? And how might their self-conception influence the composition of their social networks?\nThese are not merely academic questions. As the profile of the Indian American community has grown, so too has its economic, political, and social influence. But how Indian Americans choose to deploy this influence remains an open question. To what extent do people of Indian origin encounter discriminatory behavior\u2014on what grounds and by whom? As the United States witnesses a resurgence of violence and hate speech targeting Asian Americans, how might it affect Americans of Indian origin?\nThis study draws on a new source of empirical data to answer these and other questions. Its findings are based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian American residents in the United States\u2014the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS)\u2014conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020, in partnership with the research and analytics firm YouGov. The survey, drawing on both citizens and non-citizens in the United States, was conducted online using YouGov\u2019s proprietary panel of 1.8 million Americans and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.8 percent.\nThis study is the third in a series on the social, political, and foreign policy attitudes of Indian Americans. The major findings are briefly summarized below.\nU.S. President Joe Biden remarked in a March 2021 phone call with Swati Mohan, an Indian-origin scientist charged with overseeing the highly anticipated landing of the Perseverance Mars rover for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Indian\u2014of descent\u2014Americans are taking over the country: you, my vice president [Kamala Harris, whose mother was born in India], my speechwriter, Vinay [Indian American Vinay Reddy]. . . . You guys are incredible.\u201d1\nWhile some in the media interpreted Biden\u2019s off-the-cuff remark as an unfortunate gaffe, others viewed it as affirmation of the growing influence of the Indian American diaspora. In the same exchange, Biden later added: \u201cOne of the reasons why we\u2019re such an incredible country is we\u2019re such a diverse country. We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their dreams run forward.\u201d2\nThese sentiments are a far cry from those expressed by a special commission established by the U.S. Congress whose 1911 report declared that Hindus were \u201cuniversally regarded as the least desirable race of immigrants thus far admitted to the United States.\u201d3 More than a century later\u2014from Silicon Valley CEOs to White House power brokers and influential members of Congress to leaders in fields like journalism, health, science, and engineering\u2014the emergence of the Indian diaspora is a remarkable coming-of-age story.\nU.S. Census data affirm that Indian Americans enjoy a standard of living that is roughly double that of the median American household, underpinned by substantially greater educational attainment\u2014the share of Indian Americans with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree is twice the national average.4 However, these aggregate figures mask severe inequalities within the community. Although overall levels of poverty are lower than the American average,5 there are concentrated pockets of deprivation, especially among the large number of unauthorized immigrants born in India and residing in the United States.6\nAdditionally, a narrow focus on demographics such as income, wealth, education, and professional success can obscure important (and sometimes uncomfortable) social truths. What are the social realities and lived experiences of Indian Americans? How does this group perceive itself, and how does it believe others perceive it? To what extent does the community exhibit signs of shared solidarity, and are there signs of division as the group grows in number and diversity? These are some questions this paper attempts to address.\nWhile the social realities of Indian Americans are often glossed over, recent events have brought them to the fore. In 2020, California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against U.S.-based technology company Cisco Systems after an employee from one of India\u2019s historically marginalized caste communities (\u201cDalits\u201d) alleged that some of his upper caste Indian American colleagues discriminated against him on the basis of his caste identity.7 The suit, and subsequent media melee, triggered a wave of wrenching testimonials about the entrenched nature of caste\u2014a marker of hierarchy and status associated with Hinduism (as well as other South Asian religions)\u2014within the diaspora community in the United States.8\nMore recently, there has been a troubling surge in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Indian Americans do not appear to be among the primary targets of this violence\u2014as they were in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks\u2014the disquieting crime wave has cast a spotlight on the bigotry and violence many Asian immigrant populations experience in the United States.9\nThe official classification and self-identities of the Indian American community have posed a conundrum for more than a century, from \u201cHindoo\u201d to \u201cAsian\u201d to \u201cSouth Asian\u201d to \u201cAsian Indian\u201d to \u201cIndian American\u201d to \u201cAmerican.\u201d Indeed, even the use of the term \u201cIndian American\u201d is contested, as some members of the diaspora prefer the term \u201cSouth Asian American,\u201d10 which signifies solidarity with other groups hailing from the subcontinent. Still others reject hyphenation entirely, preferring to be known simply as \u201cAmerican.\u201d For instance, former Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal declared in 2015, \u201cI do not believe in hyphenated Americans. . . . My dad and mom told my brother and me that we came to America to be Americans. Not Indian-Americans, simply Americans.\u201d Around the same time, Nina Davuluri (who was crowned Miss America 2014) remarked, \u201cThe fact that I am rooted in Indian culture helped me win [the] Miss America pageant.\u201d11\nThis study utilizes a new source of empirical data to better understand the social realities of people of Indian origin residing in the United States. Its findings are based on a nationally representative online survey of 1,200 Indian American residents in the United States\u2014the 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS)\u2014conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020, in partnership with research and analytics firm YouGov. The survey, drawing on both citizens and non-citizens in the United States, was conducted online using YouGov\u2019s proprietary panel of 1.8 million Americans and has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.8 percent.\nThis study is the third in a series of empirical papers on the Indian American community. The first, released in October 2020, explored the political attitudes and preferences of Indian Americans in advance of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election.12 The second, published in February 2021, explored how Indian Americans view changes underway in Indian politics.13\nIndian Americans are the second-largest immigrant group in the United States.14\nAccording to data from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS)\u2014which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau\u2014there are 4.2 million people of Indian origin residing in the United States. Although a large proportion are not U.S. citizens (38 percent), roughly 2.6 million are (1.4 million are naturalized citizens and 1.2 million were born in the United States).\nThe data for this study are based on an original online survey\u2014the IAAS\u2014of 1,200 Indian American U.S. residents conducted by YouGov between September 1 and September 20, 2020. The IAAS sample includes both citizens and non-U.S. citizens; the former category accounts for 77 percent of the survey respondents. Table 1 provides a demographic profile of the IAAS sample in comparison to the Indian American sample in the 2018 ACS.\nYouGov recruited respondents from its proprietary panel comprising 1.8 million U.S. residents. Only adult respondents (ages eighteen and above) who identified as Indian American or a person of (Asian) Indian origin were able to participate in the survey. YouGov employs a sophisticated sample matching procedure to ensure that the respondent pool is representative of the Indian American community in the United States, using data from the ACS as a target sample frame. All the analyses in this study employ sampling weights to ensure representativeness.15\nThe overall margin of error for the IAAS is +/- 2.8 percent. This margin of error is calculated at the 95 percent confidence interval. Further methodological details can be found in Appendix A, along with a state-wise map of survey respondents.\nThe survey instrument contains 157 questions organized across six modules: basic demographics; immigration, citizenship, and family background; presidential campaigns and voting; U.S. politics and foreign policy; culture and social behavior; and Indian politics. Respondents were allowed to skip questions save for important demographic questions that determined the nature of other survey items. All attitudinal and perceptual measures and variables discussed in this paper are self-reported measures by respondents. For complete survey topline results, please visit Appendix B online.\nThis section provides a snapshot of the Indian American population in the United States, as captured by the IAAS. It covers five broad areas: citizenship and residency status; educational attainment; marital status; Indian region of origin; and religion, religious practice, and caste identity.\nAs table 1 indicates, 77 percent of IAAS respondents are U.S. citizens, although there is significant variation within that category.16 Thirty-nine percent of all respondents immigrated to the United States and later became naturalized U.S. citizens. Thirty-three percent were born in the United States but with at least one parent who was born outside of the United States. Another 4 percent were born in the United States to parents also born in the United States. The remaining 23 percent of the sample consists of immigrants residing in the United States who do not hold U.S. citizenship.\nNot surprisingly, of the non-U.S. citizen population, 88 percent of IAAS respondents claim Indian citizenship. But members of this group exhibit significant variation in terms of their visa status (see figure 1).\nThirty percent of non-citizen IAAS respondents possess a green card (or a permanent residency card), which places them on a pathway to gaining U.S. citizenship. Twenty-seven percent are H-1B visa holders, a visa status for high-skilled or specialty workers in the United States that has historically been dominated by the technology sector. On average, an H-1B visa holder reports living in the United States for eight years, although 36 percent of H-1B beneficiaries report spending more than a decade in the country (that is, they arrived before 2010). Eighteen percent of non-citizens reside in the United States on an H-4 visa, a category for immediate family members of H-1B visa holders. Fourteen percent of non-citizens are on F-1, J-1, or M-1 visas\u2014categories of student or scholar visas\u2014while another 5 percent hold an L-1 visa, a designation available to employees of an international company with offices in the United States. A small minority of non-citizen respondents\u20146 percent\u2014claim some other visa status.\nOf the non-citizen population residing in the United States, the survey finds that 80 percent of them would accept U.S. citizenship if offered\u2014an important preference given that Indian law forbids dual citizenship.\nFor those respondents who immigrated to the United States, over half (60 percent) arrived in the year 2000 or after (see figure 2).17 Seventeen percent arrived in the 1990s, 13 percent immigrated in the 1980s, and just 10 percent arrived before the year 1980. There is a similar trend in naturalization for those who immigrated and later took U.S. citizenship. Sixty-four percent of this subset of respondents were naturalized after the year 2000, while the remainder received U.S. citizenship before that.\nThe Government of India maintains an Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) designation for persons of Indian origin residing abroad who do not hold Indian citizenship. OCI status effectively functions as a lifetime visa and also grants recipients the ability to live and work in India on a permanent basis. Forty-two percent of respondents who are not Indian citizens have taken advantage of the program.18\nOf course, many Indian Americans\u2014irrespective of citizenship\u2014remain tied to India thanks to direct family connections. At the time of the survey, more than half (55 percent) of Indian Americans reported that they had an immediate family member (spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, son, or daughter) currently residing in India.\nThe survey also asks respondents about their educational attainment, which provides insight into the socioeconomic profile of Indians in America.\nOverall, the Indian American population is highly educated compared to the U.S. average (see figure 3), as other studies have suggested.19 Nearly three-fourths have a college education\u201440 percent of respondents have completed a postgraduate education and another 33 percent have finished four years of undergraduate study. Four percent have completed at least a junior college (two-year program) education, while 9 percent have completed some college. Thirteen percent have a high school diploma and just 1 percent have not finished high school.\nThese numbers are actually a lower bound of Indian Americans\u2019 educational attainment. Many respondents are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five and, thus, are plausibly in the middle of their educational training. If one restricts attention to respondents aged twenty-five and older, nearly 80 percent have either a college or postgraduate degree (compared to 73 percent in the overall sample).\nIn all, 52 percent of Indians in America completed their education in the United States. Of that segment that was educated abroad, 42 percent arrived in the United States with an undergraduate degree and another 38 percent had completed a graduate or professional degree before their arrival. Eleven percent finished high school elsewhere, while only 8 percent had less than a high school education. These data suggest that the vast majority of the Indian immigrant population in the United States were already highly educated prior to arriving in the country.\nIndian Americans exhibit high rates of marriage and low rates of divorce. Data from the ACS show that the share of married couple households in the community is 50 percent greater than the U.S. average.20 In the IAAS sample, 66 percent of respondents were married or in a domestic partnership.\nExisting research has found that among major Asian American communities, Indian Americans\u2014both men and women\u2014have the highest rate of endogamy (the custom of marrying within one\u2019s community) in both the first and second generations, although there is a noticeable increase in marriage outside of the community among members of the second generation.21\nIAAS data confirm this finding. Eight out of ten respondents say they have a spouse or partner of Indian origin (ranging from 85 percent of foreign-born respondents to 71 percent of U.S.-born respondents).\nThe label \u201cIndian origin\u201d itself masks variation in terms of one\u2019s place of birth. Figure 4 unpacks this further and looks at three categories of spouses or partners: Indian origin but born in India; Indian origin but born in the United States; and non-Indian origin. Responses are disaggregated by respondents\u2019 place of birth.\nAs the figure demonstrates, foreign-born Indian Americans are significantly more likely to have a spouse or partner who is of Indian origin and born in India. Seventy-seven percent of foreign-born Indian Americans fall into this category, compared to just 40 percent of U.S.-born Indian Americans. However, when compared to their foreign-born counterparts, U.S.-born Indian Americans are four times as likely to report having a spouse or partner who is of Indian origin but born in the United States (31 percent versus 8 percent). Finally, respondents born in the United States are also significantly more likely to report that they have a spouse or partner who is not of Indian origin: 29 percent of U.S.-born respondents compared to just 15 percent of foreign-born respondents.\nOverall, 19 percent of respondents report having a spouse who is not of Indian origin, but this is slightly more common among men (22 percent) than women (16 percent). Interestingly, among foreign-born respondents, twice as many men (20 percent) have a spouse of non-Indian origin compared to women (10 percent), but the gap more than disappears among those born in the United States: while 27 percent of men have a spouse of non-Indian origin, this rises to 31 percent among women.\nIn order to discern the region of origin of IAAS respondents, the survey asks whether they identify one or more state(s) of India as their home state(s). Sixty-four percent of respondents call a single state their home state, while 12 percent identify with multiple home states. Nearly one in four respondents reports no particular attachment to a state of origin.\nFigure 5 maps respondents\u2019 states of origin in India. In cases where the respondent identifies with multiple states, both states are counted as a home state. (Hence, the percentages do not add up to 100.) The western state of Gujarat emerges as the most common home state, with 14 percent of respondents calling it their home, followed by Maharashtra (12 percent), Andhra Pradesh (10 percent), and Tamil Nadu (9 percent). Other popular home states include Delhi (9 percent), Punjab (8 percent), and Kerala (7 percent).\nAnother way of examining respondents\u2019 regional connections in India is to look at their linguistic backgrounds. The survey asks respondents to identify the primary language (other than English) spoken by their mother\u2014a narrow, literal definition of the concept of one\u2019s mother tongue. Table 2 presents results of the most common languages among respondents, restricting attention to languages identified by at least 2 percent of respondents. The ordering in table 2 roughly corresponds with the map shown below.\nOverall, Hindi is the most common mother tongue (19 percent), followed by Gujarati (14 percent), English only (10 percent), and Telugu (10 percent)\u2014the latter is the primary language of the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.22 Eight percent of respondents report Tamil as their mother tongue, while 7 percent apiece report Punjabi or Bengali. Malayalam (6 percent), Urdu (5 percent), Marathi (4 percent), and Kannada (3 percent) round out the list. The balance (around 7 percent) consists of less frequently listed languages, ranging from Sindhi to Santali.\nAccording to IAAS data, 54 percent of respondents report belonging to the Hindu faith (see figure 6). The next most common response\u2014those claiming no religious affiliation (a category that includes agnostics and atheists)\u2014accounts for 16 percent of the sample. Thirteen percent of respondents are Muslim, 11 percent are Christian, and another 7 percent belong to a variety of other faiths including Buddhism and Sikhism. In certain cases, these larger groupings consist of smaller denominations that have been aggregated upward.\nIn addition to asking respondents about their religious identity, the survey also asks them about the role religion plays in their life. This emulates a standard set of survey questions that has long been asked by the Pew Research Center.23\nWhen asked how important religion is in their life, 72 percent of respondents reply that religion is either very important or somewhat important. This statistic is nearly identical to the average of the American population at large. According to a 2019 Pew survey, 70 percent of Americans said religion is very important or somewhat important in their lives.24 Notably, responses to this question in the IAAS sample do not vary greatly by place of birth; respondents born in the United States are nearly as likely to report that religion is important to them as those born outside of the country.\nThere does appear to be some variation based on respondents\u2019 religious identity (see figure 7). Muslims and Christians are significantly more likely than Hindus to say that religion is very important to them\u2014a gap of nearly 30 percentage points. Hindus, in turn, are much more likely than Christians or Muslims to state that religion is somewhat important, not too important, or not at all important in their lives.\nIn terms of attending religious services, there is also significant variation within the Indian American community. Twenty-seven percent of respondents report that they attend religious services (apart from weddings and funerals) once a week or more than once a week. This is identical to the share of all Americans who report attending services at least once a week, based on a 2020 Pew survey.25 Forty percent, the modal category, of Indian Americans report attending religious services once or twice a month or just a few times a year. Another 31 percent report little or no participation in religious services, claiming they do so seldom or never.\nThese patterns break down quite differently by religion, however (see figure 8). Christians are the most observant group as far as attending religious services is concerned. Fifty-eight percent of Christians report attending church at least once or several times per week. Nearly half of all Muslims (48 percent) say they attend religious services regularly as well. This proportion declines dramatically for Hindus, with only 21 percent reporting regularly attending religious services. A majority of Hindus (52 percent) report attending religious services once or twice a month or just a few times a year, while another 25 percent report seldom or never attending religious services.\nApart from attending religious services, the survey asks respondents how frequently they pray (outside of the times they attend religious services). Forty percent of respondents report praying either several times a day or once a day\u2014significantly more than the 27 percent of the sample that attends religious services at least once a week. The share of Indian Americans who pray either several times a day or once a day is slightly below the U.S. average (46 percent according to Pew survey data).26 Another 20 percent of Indian Americans report taking part in prayer a few times a week or once a week, while 11 percent pray at least a few times a month. Twenty-four percent of Indian Americans report seldom or never praying.\nClear differences along religious lines are evident in the responses to the question on the frequency of prayer (see figure 9). Not only are Hindus less likely to report attending religious services, but they are also less likely to say that they pray. Forty percent of Hindus say they pray once or several times a day\u2014substantially less than the 58 percent of Muslims or 66 percent of Christians who answer similarly. Hindus are also more likely than Muslims or Christians to state that they pray a few times a month, seldom, or never.27\nFinally, the survey explores the issue of caste. Caste has long been a sensitive and controversial issue in discussions about the Indian American community. Media reports about caste discrimination in the technology hub of Silicon Valley\u2014where a large number of Indian Americans are employed\u2014and a heated controversy over whether caste should be a part of history textbooks in the state of California have brought the issue to the forefront once more.28 A 2018 survey of 1,500 South Asian Americans found that many low-caste members of numerous diaspora communities had endured firsthand experience of caste discrimination. However, the study is not based on a representative sample, raising questions about the generalizability of its findings.29\nWhile caste is most commonly associated with Hinduism, caste hierarchies and caste self-identification are prevalent in most, if not all, of India\u2019s major religions. For instance, the category Other Backward Classes (OBC) is common among Muslims, while Scheduled Castes or Dalits can also be found in Buddhist, Sikh, Christian, and Muslim communities. The survey\u2019s initial question on whether respondents personally identify with a caste grouping is restricted to respondents who identify with Hinduism (and make up slightly more than half of the IAAS sample), where caste categories are reasonably well-defined.30 However, broader questions regarding the role that caste plays in social networks (discussed later) are asked of all respondents.\nForty-seven percent of Hindu respondents report identifying with a caste, which means the majority (53 percent) said that they do not personally identify with a caste group of any kind. However, there is marked variation by place of birth. Whereas 53 percent of foreign-born Hindu Indian Americans affiliate with a caste group, 34 percent of U.S.-born Hindu Indian Americans do the same. There is no variation at all based on duration of stay in the United States. Hindus who recently arrived in the United States are just as likely to identify with a caste group as those who have been here for a quarter-century or more.31\nOverall, there are 632 respondents in the IAAS sample who belong to the Hindu faith but only 293 who report identifying with a caste group. Of this latter group, the overwhelming majority\u201483 percent\u2014categorize themselves as General or upper caste. Sixteen percent identify as a member of OBC and 1 percent each identify as Adivasi/Scheduled Tribe (ST) or Dalit/Scheduled Caste (SC).\nOne should treat these findings with caution. First, as noted above, the data on caste identification is restricted to Hindu respondents. Therefore, the sample size from which these percentages is derived is small\u2014just one-half of the overall IAAS sample. Second, given the presence of SCs among some non-Hindu religious groups, it is likely that the absolute number of SCs\u2014if not the percentage\u2014in the IAAS sample is higher. Finally, given the sensitive nature of caste identity, nonresponses in the survey could mask those who do not wish to disclose their caste affiliation even if they are aware of their family\u2019s caste identity.\nIn order to be eligible to serve as a respondent for the IAAS, members of YouGov\u2019s panel must self-identify as a person of (Asian) Indian origin who resides in the United States. But self-identification as a person of Indian origin tells us little about the strength of a respondent\u2019s Indian identity. This section explores how Indian Americans view the subject of their own identity.\nFirst, the survey asked respondents how important being Indian is to their identity. Overall, 41 percent of respondents rate it as very important and another 37 percent rate it as somewhat important. Taken together, more than three-quarters of Indian Americans place a high value on their \u201cIndian-ness.\u201d Around 22 percent state that their Indian identity is either somewhat or very unimportant.32\nOne might expect, however, that the importance of a respondent\u2019s Indian identity might vary by their place of birth. For instance, it is plausible that Indian Americans born in the United States would place less emphasis on their \u201cIndian-ness\u201d than their counterparts who immigrated. In fact, that is precisely what the data suggest (see figure 10).\nEighty-three percent of foreign-born Indian Americans claim being Indian is either very or somewhat important to their identity, compared to 70 percent of U.S.-born Indian Americans. The differences are most pronounced among those who say being Indian is very important to them. On the other end of the spectrum, 30 percent of Indian Americans born in the United States answer that being Indian is either somewhat or very unimportant to their identity\u2014a response given by just 17 percent of foreign-born Indian Americans.\nThere is some evidence to suggest that there are \u201cvintage\u201d effects: the longer a respondent has spent in the United States, the less emphasis they place on their Indian identity\u2014perhaps a reflection of their gradual integration into their adopted homeland. However, the magnitude of the effect is modest. Fifty percent of respondents who have been in the United States for ten years or less say that being Indian is very important to their identity, compared to 42 percent for those who have been in the United States for more than twenty-five years. Indian Americans in this latter category are also more inclined to state that being Indian is somewhat or very unimportant to them.33 Respondents who identify as Republicans are also significantly less likely to place importance on the \u201cIndian-ness\u201d of their identity compared to Democrats or independents.\nReligious affiliation too correlates with one\u2019s feelings toward their Indian identity. Eighty-eight percent of Hindus say being Indian is very or somewhat important to them, compared to 79 percent of Christians and 66 percent of Muslims. This is possibly a reflection of India\u2019s current political climate. The February 2021 IAAS paper found that almost seven in ten Hindus approve of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s performance, while just one in five Muslims feel the same.34 However, without longitudinal data, it is unclear to what extent the religious divide reflects the specificities of the current context\u2014in which Muslims in India feel especially marginalized and discriminated against\u2014or is instead a product of longer-term trends.\nThe variation in respondents\u2019 feelings of \u201cIndian-ness\u201d begs the question of how Indian Americans navigate multiple identities linked both to their country of origin as well as their country of settlement.\nThe IAAS asks respondents how they self-identify; after all, identities are liminal and individuals might identify with any number of identity categories. To probe this issue, the survey provides respondents with eight identity categories and asks them which of the following best describes their background. The results are displayed in figure 11.\nInterestingly, while three-fourths of respondents identify with an \u201cIndian\u201d nomenclature, this masks exactly how that term is used. Only 43 percent of IAAS respondents believe that \u201cIndian American\u201d is the term that best captures their background. One-quarter of all respondents self-identify as \u201cIndian\u201d while 7 percent choose the term \u201cAsian Indian.\u201d\nTen percent of IAAS respondents identify as \u201cSouth Asian American,\u201d a term which refers to diaspora populations from countries across the region such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Six percent choose no hyphenation at all and identify only as \u201cAmerican\u201d and another 6 percent classify themselves as \u201cAsian American,\u201d an identity category that includes a wide range of diaspora groups from the Asian continent. Two percent of respondents identify as \u201cOther,\u201d indicating that none of the declared options satisfy them, while just 1 percent identify as \u201cNon-resident Indian,\u201d the official appellation used by the Government of India to refer to Indian passport holders living outside of India.\nAs one might expect, first-generation (foreign-born) and second-generation (U.S.-born) respondents approach this question differently (see figure 12). Indian Americans who are born in the United States are more likely to identify as Indian American (48 to 40 percent) and markedly less likely to identify as Indian (just 11 percent compared to 33 percent of foreign-born Indian Americans). Conversely, second-generation Indian Americans born in the United States are more likely to embrace the terms South Asian American, Asian American, and the nonhyphenated American.\nSelf-identification also varies by religion. While 86 percent of Hindus report identifying with some kind of \u201cIndian\u201d identity, 71 percent of Christians and 52 percent of Muslims do the same. Relative to Muslims, Christians and Hindus are equally likely to self-identify as \u201cIndian American\u201d (47 percent each versus 32 percent for Muslims), and Hindus are substantially more likely to self-identify as \u201cIndian\u201d (32 percent versus 17 percent for Christians and 12 percent for Muslims). On the other hand, Muslims are much more likely to self-identify as \u201cSouth Asian\u201d (27 percent compared to 7 percent of Christians and 5 percent of Hindus). Finally, Christians are more likely to self-identify as \u201cAmerican\u201d without any hyphenation (9 percent versus 6 percent for Muslim and 4 percent for Hindus).\nThe length of one\u2019s stay in the United States also plays an important role in shaping self-identification. Just 24 percent of Indian Americans who have lived in the United States between one and ten years identify as Indian American, compared to 41 percent of those who have been here for eleven to twenty-five years and 53 percent of those who have been here for more than twenty-five years. The reverse is true when it comes to identifying as \u201cIndian\u201d: the majority of Indian Americans who have lived in the United States between one and ten years (54 percent) feel most comfortable with this term, while that share declines to just 21 percent for those here for more than twenty-five years.\nAlthough \u201cIndian American\u201d is a contested category, the survey attempts to understand how respondents perceive the push and pull between different aspects of their identity. For instance, do respondents feel more Indian than American, more American than Indian, equally Indian and American, or neither Indian nor American?\nAccording to the data, the modal response of Indian Americans is that they weigh the two sides of their identity equally: 45 percent feel equally Indian and American. Thirty-one percent state that they feel more American than Indian and 19 percent state the converse\u2014that they feel more Indian than American. A very small proportion, just 5 percent, state that they feel neither Indian nor American.\nPredictably, responses vary by place of birth (see figure 13). Indeed, a plurality (44 percent) of Indian Americans born in the United States say that they feel more American than Indian (compared to 23 percent of foreign-born respondents). At the other end of the spectrum, 24 percent of foreign-born respondents feel more Indian than American, a sentiment shared by just 11 percent of their U.S.-born counterparts.\nInterestingly, those born outside of the United States are most likely to say that they feel equally Indian and American\u2014nearly one in two fall into this category (as do 38 percent of U.S.-born Indian Americans).35 A slightly higher share of U.S.-born Indian Americans (7 percent) than foreign-born Indian Americans (4 percent) claim that they feel neither Indian nor American.\nThis section reviews two aspects of the social context within which Indian Americans operate. The first part looks at three types of engagement: civic, political, and cultural. The second part examines the social networks of Indians in America and how they vary by respondents\u2019 demographic characteristics.\nThe survey asks respondents whether\u2014in the past one year\u2014they participated in any of four common methods of civic engagement: working with others in their community to solve a problem; performing voluntary community service without pay; attending a public meeting, such as for a school board or city council; or attending a protest march, demonstration, or rally. The most common activity is performing community service, something 20 percent of respondents engaged in, followed by working with others in their community (15 percent), attending a public meeting (13 percent), and attending a protest or demonstration (11 percent).\nFigure 14 disaggregates the results by place of birth and citizenship status. Respondents are classified as belonging to one of three categories: U.S.-born citizen, foreign-born citizen, and non-citizen. U.S.-born citizens report the highest levels of civic engagement, followed by foreign-born citizens and, in all categories save for one, non-citizens report the lowest levels of civic engagement.\nA much higher share of U.S.-born citizens report attending a protest (18 percent) than either foreign-born citizens (8 percent) or non-citizens (4 percent). Seventeen percent of U.S.-born citizens report attending a public meeting, while 12 percent of foreign-born citizens and 6 percent of non-citizens report doing so. Community service is the most popular form of civic engagement for Indian Americans of all types. Twenty-six percent of U.S.-born citizens report taking part in voluntary service compared to 18 percent of foreign-born citizens and 14 percent of non-citizens.\nThe one slight deviation in the overall pattern of civic engagement is found in the final category\u2014working with others in your community to solve a problem. Once more, U.S.-born citizens lead the pack with 22 percent of them reporting participation in this activity. However, non-citizens are about as likely as foreign-born citizens to engage in the resolution of community issues (12 percent versus 11 percent).\nThe survey also queries respondents about whether they participated, over the past twelve months, in any of five political activities: volunteering or working on a political campaign; posting comments online about politics; discussing politics with friends and family; contributing money to a candidate, party, or campaign organization; or contacting their elected representative or another government official.\nNearly one in two respondents (45 percent) report discussing politics in the past year\u2014by far the most common activity. Twenty-one percent report posting comments about political issues online. Contributing financially to campaigns (14 percent), contacting an elected representative or government official (12 percent), and volunteering on a political campaign (9 percent) are less popular activities.36\nAs with civic engagement, U.S.-born citizens are the most engaged, followed by foreign-born citizens and non-citizens (see figure 15). This finding tracks with other studies of immigrant communities.37\nWhen it comes to discussing politics with family and friends, there are only small differences across citizenship status. Forty-seven percent of U.S.-born citizens report engaging in this activity, but 45 percent of foreign-born citizens and 41 percent of non-citizens did so as well. When it comes to online discussions of politics, 28 percent of U.S.-born citizens posted comments about political issues on an online forum, compared to 18 percent of foreign-born citizens and 14 percent of non-citizens.\nOn the matter of campaign finance, one-fifth of U.S.-born citizens report contributing to a political campaign, while just 13 percent of foreign citizens and 5 percent of non-citizens said they did so. The low rate of political giving for non-citizens is expected given that non-citizens are forbidden from making political donations unless they are permanent residents (that is, they possess a green card). Relatively few Indian Americans across the board report contacting an elected representative or other government official: 15 percent of U.S.-born citizens, 11 percent of foreign-born citizens, and 9 percent of non-citizens engaged in this class of activities. Finally, volunteering or working on a political campaign appears to be the least common form of political engagement. Unsurprisingly, just 4 percent of non-citizens participated in this activity, while 8 percent of foreign-born citizens and 14 percent of U.S.-born citizens reported working on a campaign.\nIt is worth pointing out that nearly one-third (32 percent) of respondents report not engaging in any of the civic or political activities listed on the survey. However, non-citizens and foreign-born citizens report nonparticipation at roughly twice the rate of U.S.-born citizens: 47 and 41 percent, respectively, compared to 22 percent of U.S.-born citizens.\nThe February 2021 IAAS study examined the degree to which Indian Americans remain connected to India through cultural outlets such as Indian food, movies or television, and art, dance, or music.38 This paper looks at one additional aspect of cultural engagement: participation in select holidays regularly celebrated in India.\nThe survey asks respondents whether they participate in a set of holidays, some associated with India and others that are either associated with the United States or are more global in nature. Interestingly, among IAAS respondents, Diwali emerges as the most celebrated holiday\u201463 percent of respondents report that they celebrate the Indian festival of lights (see figure 16). U.S. Independence Day (July 4) ranks second (57 percent), followed by Christmas (54 percent). Given the relatively small share of Christians in the Indian American community, this suggests that Christmas is celebrated more on cultural than religious grounds. Rounding out the list, 41 percent report celebrating Holi (the Indian festival of colors that traditionally marks the beginning of Spring), 39 percent celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, 35 percent mark Indian Independence Day (August 15), and 20 percent commemorate Eid. Fewer than one in ten respondents (9 percent) do not participate in any of these seven holidays.\nForeign-born Indian Americans are much more likely to commemorate Diwali, Holi, and Indian Independence Day than respondents born in the United States. The differences are especially stark for Diwali and Indian Independence Day, where the gap between the two groups is on the order of 20 percentage points. There is also important variation by one\u2019s religious identity. Diwali and Holi are largely celebrated by Hindus, while very few non-Muslims commemorate Eid. Interestingly, more than half of all Hindu respondents (56 percent) celebrate Christmas compared to just one in five Muslim respondents.\nThis section reviews some basic characteristics of the social networks of Indian Americans. The objective of this inquiry is to assess to what extent Indian Americans associate with other Indian Americans relative to those from outside the community.\nThe IAAS asks respondents, \u201cWhich of the following best describes your personal group of friends?\u201d Respondents choose from a list of five possible responses (not counting \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d): that all, most, some, very few, or none of their friends are of Indian origin.\nThe modal response\u2014selected by 38 percent of respondents\u2014is that some of their friends are of Indian origin. Thirty-six percent report that either all or most of their friends are of Indian origin, while 21 percent report that very few or none of their friends are of Indian origin. Five percent responded \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d Overall, the distribution is skewed in favor of a social network populated with relatively more people of Indian origin.\nOf course, the composition of one\u2019s social networks is likely to be affected by their location. As the number and/or concentration of Indian Americans in a geography increases, one might expect that respondents\u2019 social networks might become more insular. For instance, the social networks of an Indian American in Wyoming (where there are very few Indian Americans) will likely be dominated by non-Indian Americans. But in New Jersey, where there is a significant concentration of Indian Americans, Indian Americans are more likely to associate with their own.\nIndeed, the survey finds that in counties with more Indian American households, respondents are significantly more likely to say their social networks are dominated by fellow Indian Americans (see figure 17).39 This effect appears to be roughly linear, although there is a steep rise once more than 5 percent of households in a county are Indian American.\nAs one might expect, the composition of respondents\u2019 social networks varies by their birthplace. As figure 18 shows, 43 percent of foreign-born Indian Americans have a social network dominated by Indian-origin friends, compared to 25 percent of respondents born in the United States (adding up the shares of those who say all or most of their friends are of Indian origin). U.S.-born Indian Americans, however, are more likely to report a social network with a limited number of Indians (stating very few or none of their friends are of Indian origin) or to take the middle ground\u201442 percent of them report that some of their friends are Indian origin, compared to 35 percent of foreign-born respondents.40\nHomophily\u2014the tendency of individuals to associate with people similar to themselves\u2014is a strong determinant of social networks.41 But which dimension\u2014religion, region of origin, or caste\u2014drives one\u2019s associations? The survey asks a follow-up question to respondents who report having any friends of Indian origin (of the entire sample of 1,200 respondents, 1,093 fall into this category): \u201cAmong your Indian origin friends, how many a) belong to the same religion as you; b) are from same region of India as you; and c) are of the same caste as you?\u201d The purpose of this question is to investigate whether Indian-origin social networks are internally homogenous or heterogeneous.\nFigure 19 displays the responses to this question, collapsing five response categories into three for ease of exposition. It appears that respondents\u2019 social networks are more homogenous in terms of religion than either region or caste. Forty-eight percent of respondents report that most or all of their Indian friends share their religious faith, while another 36 percent report that some of their friends are coreligionists. Just 12 percent report that hardly any or none of their friends share the respondent\u2019s religion.\nIn contrast, there is more variation on the dimensions of region and caste. Twenty-nine percent of respondents report that most or all of their friends are from the same region of India. Forty-three percent report that some are, while 23 percent say that hardly any or none are. The pattern is similar when it comes to caste, although nearly one-quarter of respondents claim they do not know what share of their friends belong to their caste group, suggesting that caste is a less salient category for a significant segment of IAAS respondents.\nGiven the relative religious homogeneity of Indian Americans\u2019 social networks, figure 20 investigates whether there is variation by respondents\u2019 religion, focusing on the three major religious groups in the Indian American community\u2014Christian, Hindu, and Muslim. Several interesting patterns emerge from this breakdown.\nFirst, Hindus are more likely to report that most or all of their Indian friends are also Hindus, underscoring a greater degree of religious homogeneity in their social networks. Fifty-eight percent of Hindus respond in this way, while 48 and 46 percent of Muslims and Christians, respectively, report that their networks are comprised of those of the same religion. Second, around one-third of Christians and Hindus and two-fifths of Muslims are situated in the middle, reporting that some of their Indian American networks are made up of friends of the same religion. Third, Christians are much more likely to report that hardly any or none of their Indian friends share their religion. Nearly one in five (19 percent) identify this way, compared to 10 percent of Muslims and only 6 percent of Hindus.\nThe smaller the size of a given group, the fewer opportunities individuals have of meeting someone from their same group. Conversely, the larger the size of a group, the greater the likelihood of meeting someone from that group. Given that there are many more Indian Americans who are Hindu in the IAAS sample\u2014and the fact that nearly half of Christians and Muslims report that all or most of their friends share their religion\u2014this means that both Christians and Muslims have substantially more religious homophily, relative to Hindus.\nFigure 21 looks more closely at the caste composition of social networks among Hindus. Seventy-four percent of Hindu respondents who report not identifying with a caste nevertheless know enough to be able to identify the caste identities of their social networks. Only 26 percent of Hindus who do not identify with a caste respond to questions about the caste composition of their social networks by answering \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d This indicates that even though a large proportion of Hindu respondents say they do not identify with a caste, only a small fraction are unaware of the caste composition of their networks.\nWhat is also striking is how relatively small the differences are between respondents who identify with a caste versus those who do not. While the former report that a slightly higher share of their social network comprises people of the same caste, if one sets aside the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses, the relative differences between caste identifiers and non-identifiers is marginal. For instance, 27 percent of Hindu respondents who identify with a caste report that all or most of their Indian friends share their caste affiliation. Nineteen percent of those who do not identify with a caste group answer similarly. Respondents who acknowledge a caste identity are only slightly more likely to report that some of their social network is made up of people of the same caste (41 percent versus 33 percent for those without a caste identity).\nThe previous section demonstrated that, for many Indian Americans, shared religious affiliation is the most important characteristic of respondents\u2019 social networks. This could be the result of circumstance and context, or it could be the product of social distance\u2014the relative distance that one feels toward members of an out-group (religious, ethnic, partisan, and so on) relative to members of one\u2019s own in-group.\nQuestions that measure social distance are often used to understand the salience of group identity and perceptions of group hierarchy, and as a basis of prediction of inter-group prejudice. The IAAS draws on a series of questions adapted from the political science literature in order to measure inter-group social distance in the Indian American community.42 Namely, the survey explores how Indian Americans feel about having close interactions with out-group members along two prominent cleavages: those who are of a different religion, or who carry a different partisan affiliation. The examination of partisanship, in turn, further distinguishes between partisan support in India and in the United States.43\nTo measure interreligious social distance, the survey asks respondents how comfortable they would be having close friends that are Hindu or Muslim. Respondents can select from one of three responses: very comfortable, somewhat comfortable, or not comfortable. The results are shown in figure 22.\nAs one might expect, both Hindus and Muslims are overwhelmingly comfortable having close friends who share their faith: 97 percent of Hindu respondents report being very or somewhat comfortable having close Hindu friends, and 96 percent of Muslims report the same.\nHowever, Hindus and Muslims exhibit less comfort when it comes to having close friends of the opposite faith. Overall, 89 percent of Hindus and Muslims apiece report they are very or somewhat comfortable having friends of the other faith. However, the major distinction has to do with the intensity of this feeling, exemplified by the sharp difference in the share of respondents who report being very comfortable with friends of the opposite faith: 52 percent of Hindus are very comfortable having close Muslim friends, while 46 percent of Muslims are very comfortable having close Hindu friends. There are, consequently, a large share of respondents who are only somewhat comfortable having close friends of the opposite faith. Christians, whose views are represented in the bottom two horizontal bars of figure 22, hold roughly similar attitudes toward both Hindus and Muslims.\nGiven the degree of partisan polarization present in U.S. politics, the survey examines how much this polarization is present within the Indian American community as well. The October 2020 IAAS study found that Indian Americans who identify as Democrats rate the Republican Party and former president Donald Trump very unfavorably.44 Republicans, for their part, view the Democrats, current President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris in equally unfavorable terms. However, whereas the earlier data looked at political leaders and organizations, this section reviews interpersonal attitudes. The data described below unambiguously reveal a high degree of polarization, although its structure is asymmetric.\nThe key takeaway is that Republicans are more comfortable having close friends who are Democrats than the converse (see figure 23). Fifty-four percent of Republicans say they are very comfortable having Democratic friends. Thirty-six percent say they are somewhat comfortable and 10 percent say they are not comfortable at all.\nDemocrats, however, are more strident in their views toward individuals from the other party. Just 27 percent say they are very comfortable having Republican friends\u2014half the number of Republicans who feel that way toward Democrats. Fifty-one percent of Democrats say they are somewhat comfortable with Republican friends and 22 percent say they are not comfortable (more than twice the number of Republicans who felt that way about Democrats). The survey\u2019s findings are notable in this regard because previous research on polarization among the American general public has generally found that Republicans, not Democrats, possess greater antipathy toward members of the other party.45\nIndian Americans who have no allegiance to either major party hold slightly asymmetric views as well. They are more likely to say they are very comfortable having Democratic than Republican friends, and three times as many say they would not be comfortable having close Republican friends than close Democratic friends.\nThe February 2021 IAAS study found several indications that polarization in India had successfully metastasized in the Indian American community in the United States. Religious differences, in particular, have emerged as a salient divide both in India and among members of the diaspora. This paper explores a different cleavage\u2014partisan affiliation in India\u2014by examining how Indian Americans who favor the Congress or the BJP view supporters of the other party.\nAs with political parties in the American context, there is a certain degree of asymmetric polarization as far as supporters of the Congress and the BJP are concerned, although both groups are generally more hostile toward supporters of the opposing Indian party than is true in the analogous case of Republicans and Democrats (see figure 24).\nThirty percent of Congress supporters are not comfortable having close friends who support the BJP; this is double the share of BJP supporters who are uncomfortable having close friends who are Congress supporters. Thirty-seven percent of Congress supporters are somewhat comfortable having friends who support the BJP (identical to the share of BJP supporters who are somewhat comfortable having Congress friends), but just 23 percent say they are very comfortable having BJP supporters as friends (for BJP supporters, the analogous share is 35 percent).\nRespondents who support neither the BJP nor the Congress\u2014listed as \u201cOther\u201d\u2014appear more favorably inclined toward the Congress. Nineteen percent of them are not comfortable having close friends associated with the BJP. Just 9 percent of them hold the same views vis-\u00e0-vis the Congress. This too mirrors the American political context, where supporters of smaller parties or those who are unaffiliated hold more favorable views toward Democrats.46\nThese findings raise two questions worthy of further exploration: Why does political polarization among Indian Americans differ from that characterizing Americans at large? And to what extent are these differences being driven by political polarization in the country of origin (in this case, India)? Immigrants often import social norms from their home countries to their newly adopted homes. However, their political views in the latter might also be influenced by politics in their country of origin. These views, in turn, are further affected both by selection effects (who emigrates) and political dynamics in the country of settlement.\nThis section reviews respondents\u2019 views on discrimination against Indian Americans. It explores this contentious subject in three ways. First, the survey asks respondents to consider how discrimination against Indian Americans compares to discrimination directed toward other minority communities in the United States. Second, the survey asks respondents about their own lived experience with discrimination. Finally, the survey examines the identity of the person(s) responsible for engaging in discriminatory behavior.\nIn the last few years, there has been much greater recognition of the discrimination faced by minority groups in the United States. For instance, a March 2020 Pew survey found that 79 percent of Americans agree that there is a lot or some discrimination against African Americans. Seventy-six percent believe there is a similar degree of discrimination against Hispanic people, while 71 percent say the same about discrimination against people of Asian origin.47\nThe IAAS survey first asks respondents if they think discrimination against people of Indian origin is a major problem. Thirty-one percent respond that it is a major problem, 53 percent believe it is a minor problem, and a small minority (17 percent) believe it is not a problem at all.\nOne way to understand the dynamics of discrimination at play is to place discrimination against Indian Americans in a comparative context. The survey asks respondents whether they believe other minorities experience a greater degree of discrimination relative to Indian Americans (see figure 25).\nA narrow majority\u201452 percent\u2014of respondents believe that people in the United States discriminate more against all of the other minority groups listed than they do against Indian Americans. That means just less than half of all respondents believe that Indian Americans face a greater degree of discrimination than at least one other minority group. Seventy-three percent of respondents believe that Asian Americans who are not of Indian origin face more discrimination than Indian Americans. Much larger shares believe that other minority groups face greater discrimination than Indian Americans, including Latino Americans (90 percent), LGBTQ Americans (89 percent), African Americans (86 percent), and women (86 percent).\nIn addition, the survey asks respondents whether, in the last twelve months, they have personally felt discriminated against. To broaden the aperture, the survey asks about discrimination along several dimensions beyond country of origin: skin color, gender, religion, and caste.\nThe data in figure 26 show that one in two Indian Americans reports being subject to some form of discrimination in the past year. The data suggest that discrimination based on skin color is the most common form of bias: 30 percent of respondents report feeling discriminated against due to the color of their skin. An equal percentage of respondents\u201418 percent apiece\u2014report that they have been discriminated against due to their gender or religion.\nMuslims report the greatest degree of religious discrimination by far (39 percent), followed by Hindus (18 percent), Christians (15 percent), and believers of other faiths (9 percent). Sixteen percent of Indian Americans report being discriminated against by virtue of their Indian heritage. And, finally, 5 percent of all respondents report having encountered discrimination due to their caste identity.\nWhen it comes to discrimination experienced by Indian Americans, a significantly larger share of foreign-born Indian Americans (59 percent) state that they have not been discriminated against on any grounds in the past year, compared to just 36 percent of U.S.-born Indian Americans (see figure 27).\nBoth U.S.- and foreign-born Indian Americans report significant discrimination based on skin color\u201435 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Interestingly, respondents born in the United States report twice as much discrimination along gender and religious lines than those born outside of the United States. Reported discrimination based on country of origin and caste is roughly similar for both groups (around 15\u201316 and 5\u20136 percent, respectively). The heightened levels of discrimination that U.S.-born respondents report compared to immigrants hold true across categories\u2014whether skin color, gender, religion, or even caste. Although the latter difference in perceptions of caste discrimination is tiny, it is nonetheless interesting given the lower degree of caste consciousness among U.S.-born Indian Americans.\nOne might expect that foreign-born respondents might face greater discrimination given that they are more likely to bear obvious markers that tie them to India (such as accents or dress). However, the results point in the opposite direction. There are a host of plausible reasons why U.S.-born Indian Americans might report greater discrimination, including differences in social norms, greater awareness of discriminatory practices, or less fear of retaliation.48\nIf half of all Indian Americans report some form discrimination, this begs the question: Who is discriminating against them? For respondents who experienced discrimination, the survey asks whether the perpetrators of discrimination were Indian, non-Indian, or both (see figure 28).\nA few findings merit attention. First, respondents overwhelmingly blame non-Indians when it comes to discrimination on the basis of country of origin or skin color. In both instances, roughly three-quarters of perpetrators were identified as non-Indians. In about one-fifth of instances, both Indians and non-Indians were perceived to be jointly responsible.\nSecond, while respondents suggest Indians hold somewhat greater responsibility for engaging in discriminatory practices along religion and gender lines, here too they point mainly to non-Indians or a combination of Indians and non-Indians as primary sources of discrimination.\nThird, caste discrimination is a surprisingly equal opportunity offense. Responses are divided neatly into thirds when it comes to who is doing the discriminating: Indians, non-Indians, and people of both categories are almost equally to blame.49\nHow might non-Indians discriminate against Indians on the basis of caste if caste is not a salient category for them? This is a genuine puzzle. One possibility is that the person or persons engaged in caste discrimination could be from another South Asian country, where caste might be a meaningful marker of status and hold greater salience.50 Another possibility is that respondents interpret caste discrimination as a stand-in for other forms of discrimination\u2014on the basis of skin color or country of origin, for example. Given that only 5 percent of IAAS respondents report being victims of caste discrimination, any subgroup analysis must be interpreted with due care given the small sample sizes involved.\nThis final section examines how respondents relate to the Indian American community. It focuses on three issues: membership in Indian American organizations, divisions within the Indian American community (and the drivers of those divisions), and the role the Indian American community plays in U.S.-India relations.\nThe survey asks respondents if they are a member of any Indian American organization or group, such as a cultural, regional, religious, caste, community, or school-based organization. Overall, one-third of respondents report membership in an Indian American organization. While this does not necessarily mean that two-thirds of Indian Americans are disconnected from their community, it does suggest that formal participation is somewhat limited. Forty percent of respondents born in the United States report being a member of an Indian American organization, compared to 29 percent of those born elsewhere.\nThe survey furthers asks respondents to assess whether they believe that domestic politics in India might be creating or exacerbating divisions within the Indian American community. Responses are very divided. Twenty-eight percent respond in the affirmative\u2014that political divisions in India are infecting dynamics within the Indian community in the United States. But this remains a minority view: 40 percent of Indian Americans do not believe that domestic politics are dividing the Indian diaspora in the United States. Fully one-third of respondents\u2014a large proportion\u2014do not express an opinion either way.\nFor the 28 percent of respondents who perceive that polarization in India is impacting the diaspora community, the survey asks what specific features of India\u2019s domestic politics are responsible (see figure 29). (Respondents can select multiple choices from a preselected menu of options, so the percentages in the figure do not add up to 100.)\nAs the figure demonstrates, religion leads the way\u201459 percent of Indian Americans believe it is responsible for creating internal divisions in the community. But religion only narrowly edges out the role of India\u2019s political leadership (56 percent) for the top spot, and political parties (47 percent) are not far behind. Rounding out the list are caste (35 percent), economic policy (29 percent), and language (24 percent). One percent of respondents point to some other factor.\nTo a certain extent, however, many of these factors are inseparable. For instance, for Indian Americans who skeptically view the rise of Hindu majoritarianism in India, it is unclear how they might apportion blame given that religion, leadership, and political parties are all deeply intertwined, especially in the current political scenario. Although Indian Americans born in the United States assess India\u2019s present trajectory more critically than those born outside of the United States\u2014a finding the February 2021 IAAS study established 51\u2014the latter are somewhat more likely to blame religion (62 percent versus 55 percent) as well as political leadership (61 percent versus 48 percent).\nWhere does this leave the Indian American community and its role in promoting U.S.-India relations? After all, for more than two decades, the Indian diaspora in the United States has been a critical bridge-builder between the two countries.52 But with divisions in the community more apparent and increasingly linked to political disputes in India, we have suggested elsewhere that the diaspora\u2019s unity of purpose could suffer a setback.53\nAs a final step, the survey asks respondents whether they agree or disagree with the following statement: \u201cOverall, the Indian American community has a positive impact on U.S.-India relations.\u201d As of now, the community is quite bullish about the diaspora\u2019s achievements in this regard. Seventy percent state that they strongly or somewhat agree with the statement. A very small minority, around 10 percent, strongly or somewhat disagrees. Around 21 percent express no opinion either way. This suggests that the evidence of polarization, while real, should not be overinterpreted either.\nMore than half a century after the passage of the historic 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which allowed for a new wave of Indian migration to the United States, the Indian American community has come of age. Its rapidly growing size, economic success, and growing political visibility have given it greater salience in American life. In many ways, the community is often portrayed as the poster child of America\u2019s historic opening to new immigrants who\u2014in ways big and small\u2014have transformed the country.\nBut that same visibility also invites greater scrutiny, shedding light on tensions within the community. This paper argues that while there is much that binds the community, there are also nascent signs that these common bonds are being tested as religious cleavages, generational divides, and political polarization invite fragmentation. In that sense, the currents coursing their way through the Indian diaspora are perhaps reflective not only of broader developments in American society but also\u2014and perhaps even to a greater extent\u2014the turbulence afflicting India.\nAt the time of writing, India is reeling under a devastating resurgence of the coronavirus. Members of the Indian American community\u2014both individually and collectively\u2014are mobilizing in response. Motivated by their emotional ties to India, as well as their rights and responsibilities as American citizens, Indian Americans have pushed the U.S. government to mount a large-scale humanitarian response.54\nFor Indian Americans, the past is not just a distant country. On the contrary, India continues to exist in the present as it influences the lives of the diaspora\u2014even as its members chart a new path in their adopted home.\nThis study is the third in a series on the social, political, and foreign policy attitudes of Indian Americans. Click here for the second part of this series, an examination of how Indian Americans view Indian politics, and click here for the first part of the series, which explores how Indian Americans view U.S. politics.\nRespondents for this survey were recruited from an existing panel administered by YouGov. YouGov maintains a proprietary, double opt-in survey panel comprised of 1.8 million U.S. residents who have agreed to participate in YouGov\u2019s surveys.\nOnline panels are not the same as traditional, probability-based surveys. However, thanks to the decline in response rates, the rise of the internet and smartphone penetration, and the evolution in statistical techniques, nonprobability panels\u2014such as the one YouGov employs\u2014have quickly become the norm in survey research.55 For instance, the Economist partnered with YouGov to track political attitudes around the November 2020 U.S. presidential election using a customized panel.56\nThe data for this survey are based on a unique survey of 1,200 adults of Indian origin conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020. To provide an accurate picture of the Indian American community as a whole, the full sample contains both U.S. citizens and non\u2013U.S. citizens. Given the fact that the majority of younger Indian Americans below age twenty-seven are born in the United States while the opposite is true of those above age twenty-seven, YouGov oversampled younger Indian Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-seven to ensure that the study\u2019s analyses can make inferences about generational differences within the Indian American community.\nTo produce the final data set, respondents were matched to a sampling frame on gender, age, and education. The main sample was matched to a frame corresponding to all adult Indian Americans, and the oversample was matched to a frame corresponding to Indian Americans ages eighteen to twenty-seven. Both frames were constructed by stratified sampling from the full 2018 ACS one-year sample. Within strata, matches were selected by weighted sampling with replacements (using the person weights on the ACS public use file).\nThe matched cases were weighted to the sampling frames using propensity scores. The matched cases and the frames were combined, and a logistic regression was estimated for inclusion in the frames. The propensity score function included age, gender, years of education, and region. The propensity scores were grouped into deciles of the estimated propensity score in the frames and post-stratified according to these deciles.57\nSampling weights were then post-stratified on 2016 presidential vote choice, as well as a three-way stratification of gender, age (four categories), and education (four categories), to produce the final weight.\nAll of the analyses in this study were conducted using the statistical software R and employ sample weights to ensure representativeness.\nThe margin of error for the full sample of 1,200 respondents is +/- 2.8 percent. This margin of error is calculated at the 95 percent confidence interval.\nFigure 30 provides the geographic distribution of survey respondents by state of residence.\nFor complete survey topline results, please visit Appendix B here.\nWe would like to acknowledge numerous individuals and organizations for making this study possible.

Bheel, and Prathap Balakrishnan, Caste in the United States: A Survey of Caste Among South Asian Americans (Equality Labs, 2018). This study relied on a nonrepresentative snowball sampling method to recruit respondents. Furthermore, respondents who did not disclose a caste identity were dropped from the data set. Therefore, it is likely that the sample does not fully represent the South Asian American population and could skew in favor of those who have strong views about caste. While the existence of caste discrimination in India is incontrovertible, its precise extent and intensity in the United States can be contested.\n30 For an overview of the debate over caste categories in Islam in South Asia, see Julien Levesque, \u201cDebates on Muslim Caste in North India and Pakistan: From Colonial Ethnography to Pasmanda Mobilization,\u201d Institut Francais de Pondichery and Centre de Sciences Humaines, June 1, 2020, https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02697381/document.\n31 Richer, more educated respondents are more likely to identify with a caste group. Thirty-six percent of Hindus with a household income below $50,000 identify with caste, but that share rises to 50 percent among households making between $50,000\u2013$100,000 and 52 percent for those above $100,000. In terms of educational attainment, 48 percent of Hindus with an undergraduate education profess a caste identify compared to 43 percent with less than a four-year college degree.\n32 The latter figure might be even greater if there are those who consider their Indian identity to be so unimportant that they do not self-identify as a person of (Asian) Indian origin in the YouGov panel to begin with.\n33 One might also expect variation based on a respondent\u2019s age. Further analysis shows that both age and duration of stay in the United States are important. Young people place less importance on being Indian, even after controlling for how long they have been in the United States. However, duration of stay remains significant.\n34 Badrinathan, Kapur, and Vaishnav, \u201cHow Do Indian Americans View India?,\u201d 20\u201322.\n35 While this might seem counterintuitive, this finding is explained by the fact that U.S.-born respondents are significantly more likely to identify as more American than Indian.\n36 A November 2020 Pew survey of American voters found that 36 percent of respondents demonstrated support for a candidate on social media, one quarter contributed money to a political campaign, 10 percent said they attended a virtual political rally or online campaign event, and 6 percent attended an online campaign event.

our nations and our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allied militaries have supported the civilian response to the pandemic, while ensuring our collective defence and the effectiveness of our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We have also provided critical assistance to a number of partners through the delivery of vital medical supplies.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to all those who combat this pandemic in our countries and around the world.\n5.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 At our December 2019 meeting in London, we asked the Secretary General to carry out a forward-looking reflection process to further strengthen NATO's political dimension, including consultations.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the important contribution of the independent group appointed by the Secretary General to support NATO 2030.\u00c2\u00a0 As a result, today we agree NATO 2030 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a transatlantic agenda for the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Throughout its history, NATO has continuously adapted to a changing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda complements and builds on our ongoing political and military adaptation, strengthens our ability to deliver on the three core tasks and contributes to making our strong Alliance even stronger and ready for the future.\n6.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 To that end we agree to:\n7.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda sets a higher level of ambition for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 It provides clear guidelines for further adaptation to address existing, new and future threats and challenges, building on the ongoing political and military adaptation of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Delivering on the NATO 2030 agenda, the three core tasks and the next Strategic Concept requires adequate resourcing through national defence expenditure and common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on requirements, we agree to increase such resourcing, including as necessary NATO common funding starting in 2023, taking into account sustainability, affordability and accountability.\u00c2\u00a0 When we meet in 2022, we will agree, alongside the Strategic Concept, the specific requirements for additional funding up to 2030 and the resource implications across the NATO Military Budget, the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Civil Budget, as well as identify potential efficiency measures.\n8.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's fundamental and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means.\u00c2\u00a0 The evolving security environment increasingly requires us to address threats and challenges through the use of military and non-military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will take a tailored and structured approach.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance's three core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It also serves as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication as an essential element to support all three of NATO's core tasks.\n9.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 For more than twenty-five years, NATO has worked to build a partnership with Russia, including through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO stands by its international commitments, Russia continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the NATO-Russia relationship.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our decisions towards Russia agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit and all our subsequent NATO meetings.\u00c2\u00a0 We have suspended all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while remaining open to political dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 Until Russia demonstrates compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities, there can be no return to \"business as usual\".\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions we have taken are fully consistent with our international commitments, and therefore cannot be regarded by anyone as contradicting the NATO-Russia Founding Act.\n10.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to rescind the designation of the Czech Republic and the United States as \"unfriendly countries\" and to refrain from taking any other steps inconsistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n11.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia's growing multi-domain military build-up, more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, the continued military build-up in Crimea, the deployment of modern dual-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, military integration with Belarus, and repeated violations of NATO Allied airspace, increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond.\n12.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to its military activities, Russia has also intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.\u00c2\u00a0 This includes attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; political and economic pressure and intimidation; widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory, including those who target and disrupt critical infrastructure in NATO countries.\u00c2\u00a0 It also includes illegal and destructive activities by Russian Intelligence Services on Allied territory, some of which have claimed lives of citizens and caused widespread material damage.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand in full solidarity with the Czech Republic and other Allies that have been affected in this way.\n13.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has continued to diversify its nuclear arsenal, including by deploying a suite of short- and intermediate-range missile systems that are intended to coerce NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has recapitalised roughly 80 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is expanding its nuclear capabilities by pursuing novel and destabilising weapons and a diverse array of dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia continues to use aggressive and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and has increased its ongoing emphasis on destabilising conventional exercises that include dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia's nuclear strategy and comprehensive nuclear weapon systems modernisation, diversification, and expansion, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons, increasingly support a more aggressive posture of strategic intimidation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to work closely together to address all the threats and challenges posed by Russia.\n14.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova within their internationally recognised borders.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with its international commitments, we call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in all three countries without their consent.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\u00c2\u00a0 The human rights abuses and violations against the Crimean Tatars and members of other local communities must end.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia's recent massive military build-up and destabilising activities in and around Ukraine have further escalated tensions and undermined security.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to reverse its military build-up and stop restricting navigation in parts of the Black Sea.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to stop impeding access to the Sea of Azov and Ukrainian ports.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Ukraine's posture of restraint and diplomatic approach in this context.\u00c2\u00a0 We seek to contribute to de-escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up our support to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements by all sides, and support the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia, as a signatory of the Minsk Agreements, bears significant responsibility in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to stop fuelling the conflict by providing financial and military support to the armed formations it backs in eastern Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our full support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We stress the importance of ensuring its safety and full and unhindered access throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and the Russia-Ukraine border, in accordance with its mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia as independent states; to implement the EU-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement; to end its militarisation of these regions and attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the continued construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our firm support to the Geneva International Discussions.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to engage constructively in the Transnistria Settlement Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to supporting the Republic of Moldova's democratic reforms and providing assistance through our Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative.\n15.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to a periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue with a Russia willing to engage on the basis of reciprocity in the NRC, with a view to avoiding misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, and to increase transparency and predictability.\u00c2\u00a0 NRC meetings have helped us communicate clearly our positions, and we are ready for the next meeting of the NRC.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to focus our dialogue with Russia on the critical issues we face.\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in and around Ukraine is, in current circumstances, the first topic on our agenda.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to making good use of the existing military lines of communication between both sides to promote predictability and transparency, and to reduce risks, and calls on Russia to do so as well.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia when its actions make that possible.\n16.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, continues to pose a direct threat to the security of our populations, and to international stability and prosperity.\u00c2\u00a0 We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 While nations retain the primary responsibility for their domestic security and their own resilience, the fight against terrorism demands a coherent, long-term effort by the international community as a whole, involving a wide range of instruments and actors.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance, and is an integral part of the Alliance's 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Cooperation in NATO adds value to Allies' national efforts and capacity to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and be resilient against acts of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn all financial support of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We also recognise the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on the fight against terrorism.\n17.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain fully committed to NATO's enhanced role in the international community's fight against terrorism, including through awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement our 2019 Action Plan and will update it by the end of this year, to take account of the evolving terrorist threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to meet our commitments under UNSCR 2396, including through NATO's new Battlefield Evidence Policy, supported by improved information and data collection, preservation, sharing, and analysis, within NATO's mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our work to defend against improvised explosive devices and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing capabilities to protect our forces against terrorist misuse of technology, while capitalising on emerging technologies to help us in the fight against terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up support to partner countries to fight terrorism themselves and deny terrorists safe haven, which in turn strengthens NATO's own security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with partner countries and other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to play its part in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da'esh, including through our Airborne Warning\u00c2\u00a0& Control System (AWACS) surveillance flights and staff-to-staff support.\n18.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 After almost 20 years, NATO's military operations in Afghanistan are coming to an end.\u00c2\u00a0 We have denied terrorists a safe haven from which to plot attacks against us, helped Afghanistan to build its security institutions, and trained, advised, and assisted the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces; they are now taking on full responsibility for security in their country.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to those who have lost their lives or have been wounded, and express our deep appreciation to all the men and women who have served under the NATO flag, and to their families.\n20.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains a leading and active contributor to international security through operations, missions, and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their substantial contributions to these efforts. \u00c2\u00a0NATO and Allies support Iraq in its fight against ISIS/Da'esh and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued efforts to combat ISIS/Da'esh.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on a request from the Iraqi Government, we will strengthen our support to Iraq through our NATO Mission Iraq.\u00c2\u00a0 We will broaden our non-combat advisory, training, and capacity building mission to support Iraq in building more effective, sustainable, accountable, and inclusive security institutions and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 This expansion of NATO Mission Iraq, including additional support to the Iraqi security institutions, will be demand-driven, incremental, scalable, and based on conditions on the ground.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors, including the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da'esh, the United Nations, and the European Union.\n21.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united and resolute in our ability and commitment to defend one another.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain and further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to ensure credible deterrence and defence and provide the Alliance with a wide range of options to tailor our response to specific circumstances and to respond to any threats, from state and non-state actors, from wherever they arise, and potentially from multiple directions in more than one region simultaneously.\u00c2\u00a0 While reaffirming our commitment to the three core tasks, we have placed a renewed emphasis on collective defence, and have also ensured that NATO retains the ability to project stability and fight against terrorism.\n22.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the significant progress already made to implement our previous decisions to strengthen NATO's deterrence and defence posture and reaffirm our commitment to their full and speedy implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have accelerated our military adaptation with increased defence spending, modern capabilities, enhanced political and military responsiveness, and higher readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is taking forward a new military strategy through the implementation of two significant military concepts that will further strengthen our ability to deter and defend against any potential adversary and to maintain and develop our military advantage now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 The deterrence and defence concept provides a single, coherent framework to contest and deter and defend against the Alliance's main threats in a multi-domain environment, and will strengthen our preparedness to address challenges, particularly pervasive instability and strategic shocks. \u00c2\u00a0The warfighting concept provides a long-term vision for maintaining and developing NATO's decisive military edge.\u00c2\u00a0 The implementation of the deterrence and defence concept will guide enhanced advance planning to respond to potential crisis and conflict, as well as further improve the use and organisation of Allied forces and capabilities in all operational domains and ensure more effective command and control.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing strategic, domain-specific and regional military plans to improve our ability to respond to any contingencies and ensure timely reinforcement.\u00c2\u00a0 We will emphasise persistent activities in peacetime to support deterrence, including through the presence and dynamic posture of our military forces and exercises, based on enhanced coordination amongst Allies and NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Through the implementation of the warfighting concept, we will ensure that the Alliance continuously develops its military and technological advantage, as the character of conflict evolves.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to the full implementation of these new concepts, and to taking the necessary steps to enhance the coherence between relevant national and NATO activities and plans and the concepts.\n23.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to further strengthening and modernising the NATO Force Structure to meet current and future deterrence and defence needs.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure a flexible, agile, and resilient multi-domain force architecture with the right forces in the right place at the right time.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen modern command and control tailored to support our 360-degree posture, dynamic force management, improved response system, and plans.\u00c2\u00a0 In doing so, we will place increased emphasis on the interdependence of geography, domains, and readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 As part of these overall efforts, we are committed to continue increasing the readiness of our forces and the Alliance's rapid response capability, including through the ongoing implementation of the NATO Readiness Initiative, which is designed to strengthen the culture of readiness and help to provide forces at 30 days readiness or less.\u00c2\u00a0 We have sourced all the combat forces of the NATO Readiness Initiative with 30 major naval combatants, 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, and 30 kinetic air squadrons.\u00c2\u00a0 They are being organised and trained as larger combat formations for reinforcement and high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis intervention.\n24.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure that the NATO Command Structure is robust, resilient, and able to undertake all elements of effective command and control for simultaneous challenges across all domains and the full spectrum of missions, including large-scale operations for collective defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Our two new commands, Joint Force Command Norfolk headquarters and Joint Support and Enabling Command, as well as the Cyberspace Operations Centre, have achieved Initial Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allied contributions to command and control through the NATO Force Structure and national headquarters as well as their strengthened relationship with the NATO Command Structure, including by providing host nation support, remain essential to improve the Alliance's regional understanding, vigilance, and ability to rapidly respond to any threat from any direction.\n25.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will not be constrained by any potential adversary as regards the freedom of movement of Allied forces by land, air, or sea to and within any part of Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 Our deterrence and defence posture is underpinned by credible forces, both in-place and ready for reinforcement within Europe and from across the Atlantic.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance's ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to give high priority, both nationally and in the Alliance, to ensuring enablement of SACEUR's Area of Responsibility to improve our ability to support the deployment and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 These efforts include taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate that NATO's efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies with the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued, including with regard to military mobility related procedures that should apply to all Allies equally.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to reinforce our maritime posture and to protect our sea lines of communication.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the NATO Maritime Security Centre of Excellence in Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain awareness of any potential threats to our critical undersea infrastructure and will continue to address them nationally and, where needed, collectively.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the Full Operational Capability of NATO's Rapid Air Mobility which was activated and utilised by Allies for relief flights carrying critical supplies to Allies and partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n26.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to respond in a measured, balanced, coordinated, and timely way to Russia's growing and evolving array of conventional and nuclear-capable missiles, which is increasing in scale and complexity and which poses significant risks from all strategic directions to security and stability across the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to implement a coherent and balanced package of political and military measures to achieve Alliance objectives, including strengthened integrated air and missile defence; advanced defensive and offensive conventional capabilities; steps to keep NATO's nuclear deterrent safe, secure, and effective; efforts to support and strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation; intelligence; and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 We have no intention to deploy land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.\n27.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, which contributes to deterrence and defence and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO's capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions.\n28.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has enhanced its IAMD mission and we have taken steps to improve our IAMD forces' readiness and responsiveness in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, strengthening our ability to ensure that all necessary measures are implemented for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We are taking into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats from state and non-state actors ranging from simple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles.\n29.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to work on NATO IAMD to ensure that it remains flexible and adaptive.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to effectively train and exercise their IAMD forces.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies have committed to improving NATO IAMD capabilities, including sensors, interceptors, and command and control, in particular through the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of NATO's new IAMD Centre of Excellence in Greece.\n30.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience is essential for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance's core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a national responsibility and a collective commitment, anchored in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the significant progress achieved since our Resilience Commitment at the 2016 Warsaw Summit, we have agreed today a Strengthened Resilience Commitment that sets out further steps we intend to take in the coming years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to take a whole-of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of our societies, and achieving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil-military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagement with our populations, the private sector, and non-governmental actors; and the centres of expertise on resilience established by Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience in Romania.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, will maintain and enhance the security of our critical infrastructure, key industries, supply chains, and communication information networks, including 5G.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will further strengthen its own resilience, ensuring our ability to consult, decide, and act together. \u00c2\u00a0We will continue to work closely with our partners and other international organisations engaged in similar efforts in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.\n31.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Our nations continue to face threats and challenges from both state and non-state actors who use hybrid activities to target our political institutions, our public opinion, and the security of our citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 While the primary responsibility for responding to hybrid threats rests with the targeted nation, NATO is ready, upon Council decision, to assist an Ally at any stage of a hybrid campaign being conducted against it, including by deploying a Counter Hybrid Support Team.\u00c2\u00a0 In cases of hybrid warfare, the Council could decide to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as in the case of an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies will continue to prepare for, deter, and defend against hybrid threats.\u00c2\u00a0 Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing our situational awareness and expanding the tools at our disposal to counter hybrid threats, including disinformation campaigns, by developing comprehensive preventive and response options.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges.\n32.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent.\u00c2\u00a0 This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm.\u00c2\u00a0 To face this evolving challenge, we have today endorsed NATO's Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which will support NATO's three core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture, and further enhance our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 Reaffirming NATO's defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.\u00c2\u00a0 We will promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict by supporting international law and voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We will make greater use of NATO as a platform for political consultation among Allies, sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses.\u00c2\u00a0 If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us.\u00c2\u00a0 Our response need not be restricted to the cyber domain.\u00c2\u00a0 We will enhance our situational awareness to support NATO's decision-making.\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience and the ability to detect, prevent, mitigate, and respond to vulnerabilities and intrusions is critical, as demonstrated by malicious cyber actors' exploitation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO as an organisation will therefore continue to adapt and improve its cyber defences.\u00c2\u00a0 Five years since the adoption of our Cyber Defence Pledge, we remain committed to uphold strong national cyber defences as a matter of priority.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement cyberspace as a domain of operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We will enhance the effective integration of sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into collective defence and Alliance operations and missions, in the framework of strong political oversight.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent opening of the NATO Communications and Information Academy in Portugal.\n33.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the growing importance of space for the security and prosperity of our nations and for NATO's deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Secure access to space services, products, and capabilities is essential for the conduct of the Alliance's operations, missions and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We will accelerate our work to deepen and expand our use of space as an operational domain, including through the NATO Space Centre in Germany and the upcoming establishment of the Space Centre of Excellence in France, which we welcome.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen NATO's space domain awareness and better integrate space in our activities, including training and exercises, resilience, and innovation efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 Consistent with the Overarching Space Policy, NATO's approach to space will remain fully in line with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the international efforts to promote responsible behaviour in space.\u00c2\u00a0 We consider that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance, the impact of which could threaten national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability, and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.\u00c2\u00a0 Such attacks could lead to the invocation of Article 5.\u00c2\u00a0 A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\n34.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to stand and act together in response to the challenging security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 As it continues to evolve, the Alliance will continue to respond and adapt as necessary.\u00c2\u00a0 Since the Warsaw Summit, we have established a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to improve our enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland through alignment with plans and by ensuring the ability of the four combat-ready battlegroups to operate with national home defence forces in an integrated manner.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored Forward Presence on land, at sea, and in the air in the Black Sea region, and we remain committed to its full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 Our assurance measures, including exercises and various other air, land, and maritime activities, remain in place and continue to provide the fundamental baseline requirement for assurance and deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored assurance measures for Turkey, and we remain committed to their full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have a range of forces, including the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which are ready to deploy on short notice to respond to any contingencies and reinforce Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The full implementation of NATO's Framework for the South, as an enduring component of NATO's deterrence and defence posture, is ongoing.\u00c2\u00a0 Building on the progress achieved since 2016, including the establishment of the Hub for the South, we will continue to strengthen our capacity to deal with the threats and challenges emanating from the South, including in the Mediterranean Sea region and its approaches, by enhancing our strategic awareness, our plans, and the readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0 In the High North, we will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities in support of the Alliance's security interests.\u00c2\u00a0 We will seek to strengthen cooperation with relevant and like-minded partners in the interests of NATO's agreed deterrence and defence objectives, in line with NATO's decisions, policies and procedures, as appropriate, and with consideration of political implications.\n35.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all aspects of the Defence Investment Pledge agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Fair burden sharing underpins the Alliance's cohesion, solidarity, credibility, and ability to fulfil our fundamental Article 3 and Article 5 commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We are, individually and collectively, committed to further improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of Alliance membership. \u00c2\u00a0We have made considerable progress since the Wales Summit with seven consecutive years of real growth in non-US defence expenditure, which reinforces our shared responsibility to provide capabilities to the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 All Allies have increased the amount they spend on defence in real terms and this trend is set to continue.\u00c2\u00a0 Since 2014, European Allies and Canada will have added 260 billion US dollars by the end of this year.\u00c2\u00a0 Furthermore, ten Allies are expected to spend 2% or more of GDP on defence this year.\u00c2\u00a0 About two-thirds of Allies plan to reach or exceed the 2% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally, 24 Allies are spending more than 20% of their defence expenditures on major equipment, including related research and development, and, according to their national plans, 27 Allies will meet the 20% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Our overall security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend it.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies continue to make valuable force and capability contributions that benefit the security of the Euro-Atlantic area through NATO's operations, missions, and other activities, as well as through the operations and missions conducted under national authority and the authority of other organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies invest considerable resources in preparing their forces, capabilities, and infrastructure for Alliance activities and Allies' operations.\u00c2\u00a0 In the years ahead, in line with the Defence Investment Pledge and building on the good progress to date, we affirm our commitment to continue our efforts as a matter of priority across the three pillars of cash, capabilities, and contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 We must and will do more.\n36.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are investing in our military capabilities in order to meet new and enduring challenges across all operational domains.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to deliver an array of robust and sophisticated capabilities across all domains, including heavier, more high-end, technologically advanced, better-supported forces and capabilities at the required readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve and adapt the sustainability, deployability, and interoperability of our capabilities for a demanding strategic environment, as well as high-end operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Our national capability development plans will support the full and timely implementation of the capabilities, in particular those required by the Alliance in line with the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 In light of the pace, breadth, and scale of technological developments, as we further develop our forces and capabilities, we recognise the vital importance of research and development and innovation to exploit the opportunities and to address the challenges posed by emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 This will help to ensure, individually and collectively, our technological edge now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue working to address, as appropriate, existing dependencies on Russian-sourced legacy military equipment through national efforts and multinational cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the modernisation of the NATO AWACS fleet and the progress of the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control programme, as well as the initial operations of the new Alliance Ground Surveillance Force.\u00c2\u00a0 Through NATO-supported multinational cooperation projects, Allies are committed to working together to develop or acquire new capabilities in key areas such as air-to-air refuelling, training, precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.\n37.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The speed of technological change has never been higher, creating both new opportunities and risks in the security environment and to the way NATO operates.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve our technological edge, and ensure Alliance interoperability, in order to maintain the credibility of our deterrence and defence posture.\u00c2\u00a0 We have recently taken important steps to that end, building on the Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) Roadmap we agreed in 2019, and have now adopted our strategy to foster and protect EDTs.\u00c2\u00a0 This strategy outlines a clear approach for identifying, developing, and adopting EDTs at the speed of relevance, guided by principles of responsible use, in accordance with international law, and taking into account discussions in relevant international fora.\u00c2\u00a0 Moreover, this strategy seeks to preserve our interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments by others, both now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Drawing on the extensive innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to maintain our technological edge.\n38.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territory and our populations against attack, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. \u00c2\u00a0No one should doubt NATO's resolve if the security of any of its members were to be threatened.\u00c2\u00a0 Faced with a highly diverse, complex, and demanding international security environment, NATO is determined to maintain the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our populations, wherever it should arise.\n39.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Credible deterrence and defence is essential as a means to prevent conflict and war and will continue to be based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 A robust deterrence and defence posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides an essential political and military transatlantic link, through an equitable and sustainable distribution of roles, responsibilities, and burdens.\u00c2\u00a0 We acknowledge the increasingly challenging security environment with risks arising from changes in the posture, doctrine, and behaviour of potential adversaries and their significant investments to develop, modernise, and expand capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to adapt and remains steadfast in its resolve to take all necessary steps to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture remains credible, coherent, resilient, and adaptable to the security environment.\n40.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies' goal is to continue to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defence and to contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 In response to the more challenging security environment, NATO has taken steps to ensure its nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure, and effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 These Allies' separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned.\u00c2\u00a0 National contributions of dual-capable aircraft to NATO's nuclear deterrence mission remain central to this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in the agreed nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies concerned will continue to drive forward progress on sustaining leadership focus and institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to ensure greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO's deterrence and defence posture, strengthen effective strategic communications and enhance the effectiveness of NATO exercises to maintain and demonstrate a credible deterrence and reduce strategic risk.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO supports efforts towards strategic risk reduction which constitute important contributions to regional and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 In particular, transparency and dialogue can help avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.\n41.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.\u00c2\u00a0 Given the deteriorating security environment in Europe, a credible and united nuclear Alliance is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 Nuclear weapons are unique.\u00c2\u00a0 The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO reiterates that any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.\u00c2\u00a0 If the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened, however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve.\n42.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to continue to deliver a NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability, to pursue the Alliance's core task of collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is purely defensive.\u00c2\u00a0 The aim and political principles of NATO BMD remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 These principles are the indivisibility of Allies' security and NATO solidarity, equitable sharing of risks and burdens as well as reasonable challenge, taking into account the level of threat, affordability, and technical feasibility, and in accordance with the latest common threat assessments agreed by the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Should international efforts reduce the threats posed by ballistic missile proliferation, NATO missile defence can and will adapt accordingly.\n43.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Turkey, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Full Allied political control and oversight are essential, and full implementation will be ensured and monitored.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with third states on a case-by-case basis to enhance transparency, build mutual confidence, and increase ballistic missile defence effectiveness.\n44.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is not directed against Russia and will not undermine Russia's strategic deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is intended to defend against potential threats emanating from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We have explained to Russia many times that the BMD system is not capable against Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent and there is no intention to redesign this system to have such a capability in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Hence, Russian statements threatening to target Allies because of NATO BMD are unacceptable and counterproductive.\u00c2\u00a0 Should Russia be ready to discuss BMD with NATO, and subject to Alliance agreement, NATO remains open to the discussion.\n45.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance's security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.\u00c2\u00a0 After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 We regret that the conditions for achieving disarmament have not been realised since the 2018 Brussels NATO Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome and fully support the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty for five years.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies believe the New START Treaty contributes to international stability, and Allies again express their strong support for its continued implementation and for early and active dialogue on ways to improve strategic stability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will welcome new strategic talks between the United States and Russia on future arms control measures, taking into account all Allies' security.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will support further arms control negotiations, with the aim of improving the security of the Alliance, taking into account the prevailing international security environment.\n46.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains clear-eyed about the challenges Russia poses, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance will be guided by experience, not least Russia's material breach of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which ultimately led to the termination of that agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to respond in a measured and responsible way to the significant risks posed by the Russian 9M729 missile, and other short- and intermediate-range missiles, to Allied security.\u00c2\u00a0 We have agreed a balanced, coordinated, and defensive package of measures to ensure NATO's deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective, including through potential arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia's proposal for a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe is inconsistent with Russia's unilateral and ongoing deployment of such systems on the continent and would not prevent Russia from building up such missiles outside of its European territory; this proposal is therefore not credible and not acceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 At the same time, NATO Allies remain open to meaningful arms control discussions and dialogue on reciprocal transparency and confidence-building measures that would take into account security interests of all Allies and increase security across the Alliance.\n47.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons, the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT in all its aspects, as an irreplaceable platform, and the strengthening of the NPT across its mutually reinforcing three pillars.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to working towards a meaningful outcome at the upcoming Tenth Review Conference, which presents a major opportunity to contribute to the preservation, universalisation, and full implementation of the NPT.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms its resolve to seek a safer world for all and to take further practical steps and effective measures to create the conditions for further nuclear disarmament negotiations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, including Article VI, in an ever more effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT, which remains the only credible path to nuclear disarmament.\u00c2\u00a0 The enduring success of the NPT cannot be taken for granted and requires sustained effort to further its achievements.\u00c2\u00a0 In this spirit, we call on all NPT States Parties to work together towards a successful Tenth Review Conference.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which is inconsistent with the Alliance's nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty's impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament.\n48.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO is not itself party to any arms control agreement, Allies will make best use of NATO as an important platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts that will support Alliance unity, political cohesion, and solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue actively to address the collapse of the INF Treaty due to Russian actions, and we are committed to maintain appropriate consultations among Allies on these issues.\n49.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain deeply concerned by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), as well as their means of delivery and related materials, by states and non-state actors, which represents a growing threat to our populations, territory, and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as use in Iraq, Russia, Malaysia, and, for the first time since NATO's foundation on Allied territory, the United Kingdom.\u00c2\u00a0 The use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, for any reason is unacceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 There can be no impunity for those who use chemical weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We therefore welcome, as an important step towards accountability, the decision by the April 2021 Conference of the State Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to suspend Syria's rights and privileges under the CWC.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to uphold the CWC and the global norm against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and to hold those who use chemical weapons accountable for their actions, including through our joint commitment within the International Partnership Against the Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the full implementation of the CWC and the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in addressing WMD threats and condemn those who seek to impede its work.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to ensuring that Allies can protect their populations, forces, and territories against CBRN threats, including through reviewing NATO's Comprehensive, Strategic Level Policy for Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Defending against CBRN Threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united in our resolve to promote the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline the need to bring the treaty into force and we support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission, including the International Data Centre and International Monitoring System.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.\u00c2\u00a0 In the meantime, the Alliance calls on all states to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n50.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to conventional arms control as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve, strengthen, and modernise conventional arms control in Europe, based on key principles and commitments, including reciprocity, transparency, and host nation consent.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia's continuing aggressive military posture, its refusal to fully comply with its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, its ongoing selective implementation of the Vienna Document, and its long-standing failure to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, continue to undermine security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies call on Russia to return to full implementation of, and compliance with the letter and spirit of all of its international obligations and commitments, which is essential to rebuilding trust and confidence, military transparency and increasing predictability in the Euro-Atlantic region.\u00c2\u00a0 We specifically call on Russia to be open and transparent about its no-notice snap exercises, large-scale exercises and large-scale troop movements, in accordance with its Vienna Document commitments, particularly in light of its recent unprovoked and unjustified military build-up in and around Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies underscore the importance of modernising the Vienna Document, and welcome the broad support for its comprehensive modernisation package.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to intensified discussions in the Forum for Security Cooperation leading to consensus on an updated Vienna Document at the 2021 OSCE Ministerial.\u00c2\u00a0 To maintain the contributions of the Treaty on Open Skies to the security of all State Parties, it is essential that all State Parties fully implement its provisions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to actively support ongoing discussions at the OSCE, including the Structured Dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to engage constructively on all these efforts.\n51.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the Alliance's full support to the goal of the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea, in accordance with relevant UNSCRs.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to engage in meaningful negotiations with the United States towards achieving this goal.\u00c2\u00a0 We urge the DPRK to fully implement its international obligations; to eliminate its nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capabilities and ballistic missiles; to return to the NPT and its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and to abandon all related programmes.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on nations to fully implement existing UN sanctions.\n52.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that Iran will never develop a nuclear weapon.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the substantive discussions between Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) participants, and separately with the United States, to accomplish a mutual return to compliance with the JCPoA by the United States and Iran.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the goal of restoring the non-proliferation benefits of the JCPoA and of ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.\u00c2\u00a0 It is vital that Iran preserves the space for these discussions by avoiding any further escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly support the IAEA in its crucial monitoring and verification work to help ensure Iran's compliance with the NPT-related safeguards obligations, as well as its other commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 A restored and fully implemented JCPoA could also pave the way to further address regional and security concerns, including in support of the non-proliferation regime.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn Iran's support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, including through financing, training, and the proliferation of missile technology and weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231, refrain from destabilising actions, and play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace.\nSyria retains an inventory of short-range ballistic missiles whose range covers parts of NATO's territory and some of our partners' territories.\u00c2\u00a0 Syria has used these missiles extensively against its own population.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain vigilant over missile launches from Syria which could again hit or target Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to monitor and assess the ballistic missile threat from Syria.\nThe increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the vicinity of the south-eastern border of the Alliance has been, and remains a driver in NATO's development and deployment of a ballistic missile defence system, which is configured to counter threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\n53.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in Syria has entered its eleventh year and continues to have significant consequences on the stability of the region and the security of NATO's south-eastern border.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned and vigilant over its ramifications.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our determination to defend NATO territory and borders against any threats and to address challenges emanating from Syria.\u00c2\u00a0 The presidential elections held on 26 May 2021 by the Syrian regime cannot be considered as free and fair and do not contribute to the efforts to achieve a political solution.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline that stability and security cannot be reinstated in Syria without a genuine political process in line with UNSCR 2254.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for a nationwide ceasefire and the reauthorisation and expansion of the UN cross-border humanitarian assistance for a period of at least 12\u00c2\u00a0months in order to meet the needs of the Syrian people.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our appreciation to our Ally Turkey for hosting millions of Syrian refugees.\n54.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain deeply concerned about developments in Belarus since August 2020.\u00c2\u00a0 The policies and actions of Belarus have implications for regional stability and have violated the principles which underpin our partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will remain vigilant of and monitor the implications for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 The\u00c2\u00a0unacceptable diversion of a civilian aircraft in May 2021 and the subsequent arrest of a journalist and his partner travelling on board endangered the safety of civilians and was a grave affront to political dissent and freedom of the press.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the independent investigations, including by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\u00c2\u00a0 We support measures taken by Allies individually and collectively in response to this incident.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Belarus to abide by international law, respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including those belonging to the Union of Poles in Belarus.\u00c2\u00a0 A democratic, sovereign, and stable Belarus is in all of our interests.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies stand ready for a mutually beneficial NATO-Belarus partnership, taking into account political and security conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will follow the scale, scope, and aftermath of the Zapad-2021 exercise, and continue to call on Russia and Belarus to act in a predictable, transparent way in compliance with their international obligations and OSCE commitments.\n55.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are concerned by those coercive policies which stand in contrast to the fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad.\u00c2\u00a0 It is opaque in implementing its military modernisation and its publicly declared military-civil fusion strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 It is also cooperating militarily with Russia, including through participation in Russian exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned with China's frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on China to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains, in keeping with its role as a major power.\n56.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO maintains a constructive dialogue with China where possible.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on our interests, we welcome opportunities to engage with China on areas of relevance to the Alliance and on common challenges such as climate change.\u00c2\u00a0 There is value in information exchange on respective policies and activities, to enhance awareness and discuss potential disagreements.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge China to engage meaningfully in dialogue, confidence-building, and transparency measures regarding its nuclear capabilities and doctrine.\u00c2\u00a0 Reciprocal transparency and understanding would benefit both NATO and China.\n57.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are working together as an Alliance and with like-minded partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect critical infrastructure, strengthen resilience, maintain our technological edge, and address these challenges to the rules-based international order.\n58.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a threat multiplier that impacts Allied security, both in the Euro-Atlantic area and in the Alliance's broader neighbourhood.\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Today we have endorsed an Action Plan to implement our NATO Agenda on Climate Change and Security, which increases our awareness, adaptation, mitigation, and outreach efforts, while ensuring a credible deterrence and defence posture and upholding the priorities of the safety of military personnel and operational and cost effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 To increase awareness, NATO will conduct annual assessments of the impact of climate change on its strategic environment as well as on missions and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 To adapt to climate change, NATO will incorporate climate change considerations into its full spectrum of work, ranging from defence planning and capability development to civil preparedness and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, drawing on best practices of Allies, and taking into account their different national circumstances, NATO will develop a mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations, which could contribute to formulating voluntary goals to reduce such emissions.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also strengthen exchanges with partner countries as well as with international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security issues.\n59.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Energy security plays an important role in our common security.\u00c2\u00a0 A stable and reliable energy supply, the diversification of routes, suppliers, and energy resources, including the integration of sustainable energy sources, and the interconnectivity of energy networks, are all of critical importance and increase our resilience against political and economic pressure.\u00c2\u00a0 It is essential to ensure that the members of the Alliance are not vulnerable to political or coercive manipulation of energy, which constitutes a potential threat.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will therefore continue to seek further diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 While these issues are primarily the responsibility of national authorities, energy developments can have significant political and security implications for Allies and also affect our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Consequently, we will continue to enhance our strategic awareness, including through regular Allied consultations and intelligence sharing, and will strengthen our links with relevant international organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further develop NATO's capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical infrastructure, including against malicious hybrid and cyber activity.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure reliable energy supplies to our military forces.\n60.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has long recognised the importance of Human Security, which focuses on risks and threats to populations in conflict or crisis areas and how to mitigate and respond to them.\u00c2\u00a0 Taking a Human Security approach is a reflection of our values and makes us more operationally effective.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that all efforts are made to avoid, minimise, and mitigate any potential negative effects on civilians arising from our missions or activities, as underscored in our Policy for the Protection of Civilians.\u00c2\u00a0 Today, we endorse NATO's new Policy on Preventing and Responding to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, a landmark demonstration of our commitment to addressing such violence, which inflicts long-term stigma and trauma on individuals and families, contributes to their marginalisation, destroys the social fabric of communities, triggers displacement, fuels armed actors' activities, fosters prolonged conflict and instability, and is an impediment to sustainable peace and reconciliation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are updating our policy on combating trafficking in human beings.\u00c2\u00a0 Our ongoing work on Human Security also includes Children and Armed Conflict and Cultural Property Protection.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to work with its partners, international organisations, and civil society to further our Human Security agenda, which includes robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in support of lasting peace and security and our populations' common defence.\n61.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the critical importance of women's full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, as well as the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including conflict-related sexual violence, we are committed to fully implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's Policy and Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security better prepare the Alliance to address the challenges of today and tomorrow.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's Policy on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, agreed in 2019, reinforces our commitment to hold ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour, in keeping with our values.\u00c2\u00a0 Working together with partners, international organisations, and civil society, we will consistently continue to implement our policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, and activities.\n62.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO's Building Integrity Policy and Programme.\u00c2\u00a0 Corruption and poor governance undermine democracy, the rule of law, and economic development, thus constituting challenges to our security.\u00c2\u00a0 Implementing measures to improve integrity building, to fight against corruption, and to foster good governance is of continued importance for NATO, Allies, and partners alike.\n63.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of NATO's partnerships is demonstrated by their strategic contribution to Alliance and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 They play an important role in supporting NATO's three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.\u00c2\u00a0 They are central to advancing NATO's cooperative security agenda, helping to shape our security environment, and contributing to stability in the Euro-Atlantic area, and to the pursuit of NATO's political and military objectives.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent, and more effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance's partner relationships are also based on reciprocity, mutual benefit and mutual respect.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO's situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise their sacrifices for Euro-Atlantic and international security over the years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve interoperability, in particular with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising that conflict and instability in NATO's neighbourhood directly undermine Allied security, we will continue to intensify NATO's assistance and capacity building support to our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to expand political dialogue and practical cooperation with any nation that shares the Alliance's values and interest in international peace and security and will further develop our partnerships so that they continue to meet the interests of both Allies and partners.\u00c2\u00a0 In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO's own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations.\n64.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO-EU strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence.\u00c2\u00a0 The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.\u00c2\u00a0 Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.\u00c2\u00a0 Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU's efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies' fullest involvement in these efforts is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to further strengthen our strategic partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations' different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations.\n65.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO-EU cooperation has reached unprecedented levels, with tangible results in countering hybrid and cyber threats, strategic communication, operational cooperation including maritime issues, military mobility, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, exercises, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance this cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to develop and deepen our cooperation by fully implementing the common set of 74 proposals, which contribute to the coherence and complementarity of our efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 The current strategic environment and the COVID pandemic underscore the importance of NATO-EU cooperation in the face of current and evolving security challenges, in particular in addressing resilience issues, emerging and disruptive technologies, the security implications of climate change, disinformation, and the growing geostrategic competition.\u00c2\u00a0 The ongoing distinct strategic processes within NATO and the EU offer a unique opportunity to intensify further our consultations and cooperation to enhance the security of our citizens and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond, while reaffirming that NATO remains the transatlantic framework for strong collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the Secretary General's continued close cooperation with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the High Representative, on all aspects of the NATO-EU strategic partnership.\n66.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to NATO's Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, which has been a historic success.\u00c2\u00a0 North Macedonia's accession last year is yet another tangible demonstration of this commitment.\u00c2\u00a0 Successive rounds of enlargement have strengthened Euro-Atlantic security by helping to spread and consolidate the rule of law and democratic institutions and practices across the European continent, and have respected the right of all states to seek their own security arrangements, as enshrined in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's door remains open to all European democracies which share the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, which are in a position to further the principles of the Treaty, and whose inclusion can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself; no third party has a say in that process.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to the integration of those countries that aspire to join the Alliance, judging each on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage them to continue to implement the necessary reforms and decisions to prepare for membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to offer support to their efforts and look to them to take the steps necessary to advance their aspirations.\n67.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements, encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to avoid divisive rhetoric.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aspirant country, for its contributions to NATO-led operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to maintaining strong political dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and offer our continued support to the implementation of all reform efforts, including through NATO HQ Sarajevo.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take full advantage of the breadth of NATO cooperative security and partnership tools.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies welcome the work of the Commission for Cooperation with NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge political leaders to work constructively and to demonstrate political will for the benefit of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina in advancing Euro-Atlantic aspirations by implementing the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, including through the country's Reform Programme with NATO, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership.\n68.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Georgia's right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 As an Enhanced Opportunities Partner, Georgia is cooperating closely with the Alliance across a wide range of issues.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly appreciate Georgia's substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent political agreement on the Way Ahead for Georgia and encourage its full implementation by all sides.\u00c2\u00a0 This agreement paves the way for the important reforms which will help Georgia, an aspirant country, progress in its preparations towards membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme in deepening political dialogue and cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the significant progress on reforms which Georgia has made and must continue to make, and which have helped Georgia strengthen its defence capabilities and interoperability with the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Georgia's relationship with the Alliance contains all the practical tools to prepare for eventual membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We are working closely with Georgia on security in the Black Sea region, in response to Russia's increasingly destabilising activities, and welcome the steps taken to implement the refreshed Substantial NATO-Georgia Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand ready to enhance our support to Georgia, including in building resilience against hybrid threats, in training and exercises, and in secure communications.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to the next NATO-Georgia exercise in 2022.\n69.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Ukraine's right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 The Annual National Programmes under the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) remain the mechanism by which Ukraine takes forward the reforms pertaining to its aspiration for NATO membership.\u00c2\u00a0 Ukraine should make full use of all instruments available under the NUC to reach its objective of implementing NATO principles and standards.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of wide-ranging, sustainable, and irreversible reforms, including combating corruption, promoting an inclusive political process, and decentralisation reform, based on democratic values, respect for human rights, minorities, and the rule of law, will be crucial in laying the groundwork for a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Further reforms in the security sector, including the reform of the Security Services of Ukraine, are particularly important.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome significant reforms already made by Ukraine and strongly encourage further progress in line with Ukraine's international obligations and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to provide practical support to reform in the security and defence sector, including through the Comprehensive Assistance Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its resilience against hybrid threats, including through intensifying activities under the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the cooperation between NATO and Ukraine with regard to security in the Black Sea region.\u00c2\u00a0 The Enhanced Opportunities Partner status granted last year provides further impetus to our already ambitious cooperation and will promote greater interoperability, with the option of more joint exercises, training, and enhanced situational awareness.\u00c2\u00a0 Military cooperation and capacity building initiatives between Allies and Ukraine, including the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, further reinforce this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly value Ukraine's significant contributions to Allied operations, the NATO Response Force, and NATO exercises.\n70.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO, as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans and to supporting the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the countries in the region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will intensify our efforts in the region and enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reform efforts, promote regional peace and security, and counter the malign influence of outside actors.\u00c2\u00a0 Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the NATO-Serbia partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.\n71.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO's continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) which contributes to a safe and secure environment and to wider stability in the Western Balkans, and through ongoing capacity building efforts with the Kosovo security organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Any changes to our force posture in KFOR remain conditions-based and not calendar-driven.\n72.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance's close and mutually beneficial security cooperation with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners Finland and Sweden, which share our values and contribute to NATO-led operations and missions, has grown across a wide range of areas.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to any common challenges and to work together on enhancing our resilience and civil preparedness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will bolster our regular and open political dialogue and cooperation in support of our common security, including by crisis management preparation, exercises, and exchanging information and analysis, notably on the security situation in the Baltic Sea region.\n73.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will work more closely with all our Western European partners to share expertise, address emerging security challenges, and continue our cooperation on operations, missions, and other initiatives.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also seek to further develop relations with our partners across the globe.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing political dialogue and practical cooperation with our long-standing Asia-Pacific partners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to promote cooperative security and support the rules-based international order.\u00c2\u00a0 We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO's interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared concerns.\u00c2\u00a0 We are intensifying our interaction with Colombia, NATO's partner in Latin America, on good governance, military training, interoperability, demining, and maritime security.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to deepening our political dialogue and intensifying our practical cooperation with our partners in Central Asia, taking into account the regional situation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the interest of other global actors to work with NATO in addressing our shared security concerns and stand ready to explore further engagement on a case-by-case basis.\n74.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to enhancing our long-standing engagement in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen our political dialogue and practical cooperation with our Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) partners.\u00c2\u00a0 This will build stronger security and defence institutions and capacities, promote interoperability, and help to counter terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We have upgraded our defence capacity building assistance to Jordan, our Enhanced Opportunities Partner, to include additional counter-terrorism support, and have contributed to the establishment of the new Military Women's Training Centre.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our engagement with Tunisia on defence capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 We will leverage the NATO-ICI Regional Centre in Kuwait as an important hub for education, training, and public diplomacy activities, and we remain open to the potential establishment of other education and training centres with interested MENA countries.\u00c2\u00a0 Our Regional Hub for the South, in Naples, is making tangible progress in implementing its four functions and contributing to our situational awareness and understanding.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with the African Union and further develop our relations with the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council in order to enhance our ability to better address mutual security concerns.\n75.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The deteriorating situation in the Sahel region matters to NATO's collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 This region is a theatre of complex and interconnected challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's approach to the Sahel is currently focused on our long-standing partnership with Mauritania, and we are looking into providing additional advice and training support.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to engage in dialogue with relevant NATO partners, representatives from the Sahel region, international and regional organisations and entities such as the African Union, the G5 Sahel structures, the UN, and the EU, as well as with the Coalition for the Sahel.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will enhance its engagement with the G5 Sahel structures and remains open, upon request, to consider further engagements in the region.\n76.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The crisis in Libya has direct implications for regional stability and the security of all Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the progress achieved in Libya, including the recent endorsement of the interim Government of National Unity (GNU) and Presidency Council.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the UN efforts in support of a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, aimed at promoting national reconciliation as well as unifying and strengthening state institutions.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on all the relevant Libyan authorities and institutions, including the GNU and the House of Representatives, to take actions set out in the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum roadmap and to make the necessary preparations for free, fair, and inclusive national Presidential and Parliamentary elections on 24\u00c2\u00a0December\u00c2\u00a02021.\u00c2\u00a0 We fully support the implementation of UNSCRs 2570 and 2571 and the 23 October 2020 ceasefire agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with our Summit decisions, we remain committed to providing advice to Libya, upon its request, in the area of defence and security institution building, taking into account political and security conditions.\n77.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is an Alliance that constantly modernises and adapts to new threats and challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is also adapting as an institution.\u00c2\u00a0 To enhance our political-military coherence and situational awareness, we have restructured the activities of the NATO Headquarters, and established a Chief Information Officer function.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome and will continue progress towards an optimised NATO intelligence enterprise, better postured to provide timely and relevant support to Alliance operations and decision-making on contemporary and future challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also further strengthen the security of our cyber and communications systems and continue to protect the Alliance against espionage attempts.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continuously pursue greater coherence, improved effectiveness, and new efficiencies, in support of the flexibility and responsiveness we need as an Alliance.\n78.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We express our deep appreciation for the generous hospitality extended to NATO by the Government and the people of Belgium for over five decades, and to us today on the occasion of our Summit meeting at NATO Headquarters.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to all the men and women in uniform who continue to work daily for our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 And we extend a special word of thanks to all those who made it possible for us to have a safe and productive Summit meeting despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the NATO medical personnel and the Polish Medical Emergency Detachment.\n79.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 With our decisions today, we have opened a new chapter in the transatlantic relationship and set the direction for the Alliance's continued adaptation towards 2030 and beyond.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to meeting again in Spain in 2022, followed by our next meeting in Lithuania."

20211.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We, the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies, have gathered in Brussels to reaffirm our unity, solidarity, and cohesion, and to open a new chapter in transatlantic relations, at a time when the security environment we face is increasingly complex.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains the foundation of our collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is a defensive Alliance and will continue to strive for peace, security, and stability in the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain firmly committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founding Washington Treaty, including that an attack against one Ally shall be considered an attack against us all, as enshrined in Article 5.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to pursue a 360-degree approach to protect and defend our indivisible security and to fulfil NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management, and cooperative security.2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is the strongest and most successful Alliance in history.\u00c2\u00a0 It guarantees the security of our territory and our one billion citizens, our freedom, and the values we share, including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.\u00c2\u00a0 We are bound together by our common values, enshrined in the Washington Treaty, the bedrock of our unity, solidarity, and cohesion.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to fulfiling our responsibilities as Allies accordingly.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to the rules-based international order.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to reinforce consultations when the security or stability of an Ally is threatened or when our fundamental values and principles are at risk.3.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We face multifaceted threats, systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers, as well as growing security challenges to our countries and our citizens from all strategic directions.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security; terrorism in all its forms and manifestations remains a persistent threat to us all.\u00c2\u00a0 State and non-state actors challenge the rules-based international order and seek to undermine democracy across the globe.\u00c2\u00a0 Instability beyond our borders is also contributing to irregular migration and human trafficking.\u00c2\u00a0 China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We will engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We are increasingly confronted by cyber, hybrid, and other asymmetric threats, including disinformation campaigns, and by the malicious use of ever-more sophisticated emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 Rapid advances in the space domain are affecting our security.\u00c2\u00a0 The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the erosion of the arms control architecture also undermine our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change is a threat multiplier that impacts Alliance security.\u00c2\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territories and our populations against attack, and we will address all threats and challenges which affect Euro-Atlantic security.4.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We gather at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic continues to test our nations and our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allied militaries have supported the civilian response to the pandemic, while ensuring our collective defence and the effectiveness of our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We have also provided critical assistance to a number of partners through the delivery of vital medical supplies.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to all those who combat this pandemic in our countries and around the world.5.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 At our December 2019 meeting in London, we asked the Secretary General to carry out a forward-looking reflection process to further strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political dimension, including consultations.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the important contribution of the independent group appointed by the Secretary General to support NATO 2030.\u00c2\u00a0 As a result, today we agree NATO 2030 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a transatlantic agenda for the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Throughout its history, NATO has continuously adapted to a changing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda complements and builds on our ongoing political and military adaptation, strengthens our ability to deliver on the three core tasks and contributes to making our strong Alliance even stronger and ready for the future.6.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 To that end we agree to:Reaffirm that NATO is the unique, essential and indispensable transatlantic forum for consultations and joint action on all matters related to our individual and collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 We pledge to strengthen and broaden our consultations and to ensure that NATO remains flexible and effective to conduct military operations in support of our common security.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared democratic principles as well as our commitment to the spirit and the letter of the North Atlantic Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to reinforcing consultations when the security or stability of an Ally is threatened or when our fundamental values and principles are at risk.Strengthen NATO as the organising framework for the collective defence of the Euro-Atlantic area, against all threats, from all directions.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our commitment to maintaining an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities for deterrence and defence, and to the 2014 Defence Investment Pledge, in its entirety.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to the full and speedy implementation of ongoing work to further strengthen our deterrence and defence posture, and we pledge to continue to improve the readiness of our forces and to strengthen and modernise the NATO Force Structure to meet current and future defence needs.Enhance our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 Noting that resilience remains a national responsibility, we will adopt a more integrated and better coordinated approach, consistent with our collective commitment under Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure our militaries can effectively operate in peace, crisis and conflict.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will develop a proposal to establish, assess, review and monitor resilience objectives to guide nationally-developed resilience goals and implementation plans.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be up to each individual Ally to determine how to establish and meet national resilience goals and implementation plans, allowing them to do so in a manner that is compatible with respective national competences, structures, processes and obligations, and where applicable those of the EU.Foster technological cooperation among Allies in NATO, promote interoperability and encourage the development and adoption of technological solutions to address our military needs.\u00c2\u00a0 For this purpose we will launch a civil-military Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic.\u00c2\u00a0 We also agree to establish a NATO Innovation Fund, where Allies who so wish can support start-ups working on dual-use emerging and disruptive technologies in areas key to Allied security.Enhance NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to contribute to preserve and shape the rules-based international order in areas that are important to Allied security.\u00c2\u00a0 We will increase our dialogue and practical cooperation with existing partners, including with the European Union, aspirant countries and our partners in the Asia Pacific, and strengthen our engagement with key global actors and other new interlocutors beyond the Euro-Atlantic area, including from Africa, Asia and Latin America.Substantially strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to provide training and capacity building support to partners, recognising that conflict, other security developments and pervasive instability in NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbourhood directly impact Allied security.Aim for NATO to become the leading international organisation when it comes to understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security.\u00c2\u00a0 We agree to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations without impairing personnel safety, operational effectiveness and our deterrence and defence posture.\u00c2\u00a0 We invite the Secretary General to formulate a realistic, ambitious and concrete target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO political and military structures and facilities and assess the feasibility of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also initiate a regular high-level climate and security dialogue to exchange views and coordinate further action.Invite the Secretary General to lead the process to develop the next Strategic Concept.\u00c2\u00a0 The Concept will be negotiated and agreed by the Council in Permanent Session and endorsed by NATO Leaders at the next Summit.7.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda sets a higher level of ambition for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 It provides clear guidelines for further adaptation to address existing, new and future threats and challenges, building on the ongoing political and military adaptation of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Delivering on the NATO 2030 agenda, the three core tasks and the next Strategic Concept requires adequate resourcing through national defence expenditure and common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on requirements, we agree to increase such resourcing, including as necessary NATO common funding starting in 2023, taking into account sustainability, affordability and accountability.\u00c2\u00a0 When we meet in 2022, we will agree, alongside the Strategic Concept, the specific requirements for additional funding up to 2030 and the resource implications across the NATO Military Budget, the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Civil Budget, as well as identify potential efficiency measures.8.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means.\u00c2\u00a0 The evolving security environment increasingly requires us to address threats and challenges through the use of military and non-military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will take a tailored and structured approach.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It also serves as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication as an essential element to support all three of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core tasks.9.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 For more than twenty-five years, NATO has worked to build a partnership with Russia, including through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO stands by its international commitments, Russia continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the NATO-Russia relationship.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our decisions towards Russia agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit and all our subsequent NATO meetings.\u00c2\u00a0 We have suspended all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while remaining open to political dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 Until Russia demonstrates compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities, there can be no return to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness as usual\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions we have taken are fully consistent with our international commitments, and therefore cannot be regarded by anyone as contradicting the NATO-Russia Founding Act.10.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to rescind the designation of the Czech Republic and the United States as \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfriendly countries\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to refrain from taking any other steps inconsistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.11.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing multi-domain military build-up, more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, the continued military build-up in Crimea, the deployment of modern dual-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, military integration with Belarus, and repeated violations of NATO Allied airspace, increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond.12.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to its military activities, Russia has also intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.\u00c2\u00a0 This includes attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; political and economic pressure and intimidation; widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory, including those who target and disrupt critical infrastructure in NATO countries.\u00c2\u00a0 It also includes illegal and destructive activities by Russian Intelligence Services on Allied territory, some of which have claimed lives of citizens and caused widespread material damage.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand in full solidarity with the Czech Republic and other Allies that have been affected in this way.13.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has continued to diversify its nuclear arsenal, including by deploying a suite of short- and intermediate-range missile systems that are intended to coerce NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has recapitalised roughly 80 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is expanding its nuclear capabilities by pursuing novel and destabilising weapons and a diverse array of dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia continues to use aggressive and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and has increased its ongoing emphasis on destabilising conventional exercises that include dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear strategy and comprehensive nuclear weapon systems modernisation, diversification, and expansion, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons, increasingly support a more aggressive posture of strategic intimidation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to work closely together to address all the threats and challenges posed by Russia.14.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova within their internationally recognised borders.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with its international commitments, we call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in all three countries without their consent.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\u00c2\u00a0 The human rights abuses and violations against the Crimean Tatars and members of other local communities must end.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent massive military build-up and destabilising activities in and around Ukraine have further escalated tensions and undermined security.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to reverse its military build-up and stop restricting navigation in parts of the Black Sea.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to stop impeding access to the Sea of Azov and Ukrainian ports.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture of restraint and diplomatic approach in this context.\u00c2\u00a0 We seek to contribute to de-escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up our support to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements by all sides, and support the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia, as a signatory of the Minsk Agreements, bears significant responsibility in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to stop fuelling the conflict by providing financial and military support to the armed formations it backs in eastern Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our full support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We stress the importance of ensuring its safety and full and unhindered access throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and the Russia-Ukraine border, in accordance with its mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia as independent states; to implement the EU-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement; to end its militarisation of these regions and attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the continued construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our firm support to the Geneva International Discussions.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to engage constructively in the Transnistria Settlement Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to supporting the Republic of Moldova\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democratic reforms and providing assistance through our Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative.15.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to a periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue with a Russia willing to engage on the basis of reciprocity in the NRC, with a view to avoiding misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, and to increase transparency and predictability.\u00c2\u00a0 NRC meetings have helped us communicate clearly our positions, and we are ready for the next meeting of the NRC.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to focus our dialogue with Russia on the critical issues we face.\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in and around Ukraine is, in current circumstances, the first topic on our agenda.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to making good use of the existing military lines of communication between both sides to promote predictability and transparency, and to reduce risks, and calls on Russia to do so as well.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia when its actions make that possible.16.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, continues to pose a direct threat to the security of our populations, and to international stability and prosperity.\u00c2\u00a0 We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 While nations retain the primary responsibility for their domestic security and their own resilience, the fight against terrorism demands a coherent, long-term effort by the international community as a whole, involving a wide range of instruments and actors.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance, and is an integral part of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Cooperation in NATO adds value to Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 national efforts and capacity to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and be resilient against acts of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn all financial support of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We also recognise the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on the fight against terrorism.17.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain fully committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enhanced role in the international community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight against terrorism, including through awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement our 2019 Action Plan and will update it by the end of this year, to take account of the evolving terrorist threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to meet our commitments under UNSCR 2396, including through NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Battlefield Evidence Policy, supported by improved information and data collection, preservation, sharing, and analysis, within NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our work to defend against improvised explosive devices and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing capabilities to protect our forces against terrorist misuse of technology, while capitalising on emerging technologies to help us in the fight against terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up support to partner countries to fight terrorism themselves and deny terrorists safe haven, which in turn strengthens NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with partner countries and other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to play its part in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh, including through our Airborne Warning\u00c2\u00a0& Control System (AWACS) surveillance flights and staff-to-staff support.18.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 After almost 20 years, NATO's military operations in Afghanistan are coming to an end.\u00c2\u00a0 We have denied terrorists a safe haven from which to plot attacks against us, helped Afghanistan to build its security institutions, and trained, advised, and assisted the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces; they are now taking on full responsibility for security in their country.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to those who have lost their lives or have been wounded, and express our deep appreciation to all the men and women who have served under the NATO flag, and to their families.19.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Withdrawing our troops does not mean ending our relationship with Afghanistan.\u00c2\u00a0 We will now open a new chapter.\u00c2\u00a0 We affirm our commitment to continue to stand with Afghanistan, its people, and its institutions in promoting security and upholding thehard-won gains of the last 20 years.\u00c2\u00a0 Recalling our previous commitments, NATO will continue to provide training and financial support to the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will retain a Senior Civilian Representative's Office in Kabul to continue diplomatic engagement and enhance our partnership with Afghanistan.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising its importance to an enduring diplomatic and international presence, as well as to Afghanistan's connectivity with the world, NATO will provide transitional funding to ensure continued functioning of Hamid Karzai International Airport.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also step up dialogue on Afghanistan with relevant international and regional partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to support the ongoing Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, and call on all stakeholders to help Afghanistan foster a lasting inclusive political settlement that puts an end to violence; safeguards the human rights of Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities; upholds the rule of law; and ensures that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists.\u00c2\u00a020.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains a leading and active contributor to international security through operations, missions, and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their substantial contributions to these efforts. \u00c2\u00a0NATO and Allies support Iraq in its fight against ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued efforts to combat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on a request from the Iraqi Government, we will strengthen our support to Iraq through our NATO Mission Iraq.\u00c2\u00a0 We will broaden our non-combat advisory, training, and capacity building mission to support Iraq in building more effective, sustainable, accountable, and inclusive security institutions and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 This expansion of NATO Mission Iraq, including additional support to the Iraqi security institutions, will be demand-driven, incremental, scalable, and based on conditions on the ground.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors, including the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh, the United Nations, and the European Union.21.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united and resolute in our ability and commitment to defend one another.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain and further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to ensure credible deterrence and defence and provide the Alliance with a wide range of options to tailor our response to specific circumstances and to respond to any threats, from state and non-state actors, from wherever they arise, and potentially from multiple directions in more than one region simultaneously.\u00c2\u00a0 While reaffirming our commitment to the three core tasks, we have placed a renewed emphasis on collective defence, and have also ensured that NATO retains the ability to project stability and fight against terrorism.22.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the significant progress already made to implement our previous decisions to strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture and reaffirm our commitment to their full and speedy implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have accelerated our military adaptation with increased defence spending, modern capabilities, enhanced political and military responsiveness, and higher readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0NATO is taking forward a new military strategy through the implementation of two significant military concepts that will further strengthen our ability to deter and defend against any potential adversary and to maintain and develop our military advantage now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 The deterrence and defence concept provides a single, coherent framework to contest\u00c2\u00a0and deter and defend against the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main threats in a multi-domain environment, and will strengthen our preparedness to address challenges, particularly pervasive instability and strategic shocks. \u00c2\u00a0The warfighting concept provides a long-term vision for maintaining and developing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisive military edge.\u00c2\u00a0 The implementation of the deterrence and defence concept will guide enhanced advance planning to respond to potential crisis and conflict, as well as further improve the use and organisation of Allied forces and capabilities in all operational domains and ensure more effective command and control.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing strategic, domain-specific and regional military plans to improve our ability to respond to any contingencies and ensure timely reinforcement.\u00c2\u00a0 We will emphasise persistent activities in peacetime to support deterrence, including through the presence and dynamic posture of our military forces and exercises, based on enhanced coordination amongst Allies and NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Through the implementation of the warfighting concept, we will ensure that the Alliance continuously develops its military and technological advantage, as the character of conflict evolves.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to the full implementation of these new concepts, and to taking the necessary steps to enhance the coherence between relevant national and NATO activities and plans and the concepts.23.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to further strengthening and modernising the NATO Force Structure to meet current and future deterrence and defence needs.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure a flexible, agile, and resilient multi-domain force architecture with the right forces in the right place at the right time.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen modern command and control tailored to support our 360-degree posture, dynamic force management, improved response system, and plans.\u00c2\u00a0 In doing so, we will place increased emphasis on the interdependence of geography, domains, and readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 As part of these overall efforts, we are committed to continue increasing the readiness of our forces and the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid response capability, including through the ongoing implementation of the NATO Readiness Initiative, which is designed to strengthen the culture of readiness and help to provide forces at 30 days readiness or less.\u00c2\u00a0 We have sourced all the combat forces of the NATO Readiness Initiative with 30 major naval combatants, 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, and 30 kinetic air squadrons.\u00c2\u00a0 They are being organised and trained as larger combat formations for reinforcement and high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis intervention.24.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure that the NATO Command Structure is robust, resilient, and able to undertake all elements of effective command and control for simultaneous challenges across all domains and the full spectrum of missions, including large-scale operations for collective defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Our two new commands, Joint Force Command Norfolk headquarters and Joint Support and Enabling Command, as well as the Cyberspace Operations Centre, have achieved Initial Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allied contributions to command and control through the NATO Force Structure and national headquarters as well as their strengthened relationship with the NATO Command Structure, including by providing host nation support, remain essential to improve the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional understanding, vigilance, and ability to rapidly respond to any threat from any direction.25.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will not be constrained by any potential adversary as regards the freedom of movement of Allied forces by land, air, or sea to and within any part of Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 Our deterrence and defence posture is underpinned by credible forces, both in-place and ready for reinforcement within Europe and from across the Atlantic.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to give high priority, both nationally and in the Alliance, to ensuring enablement of SACEUR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Area of Responsibility to improve our ability to support the deployment and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 These efforts include taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate that NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies with the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued, including with regard to military mobility related procedures that should apply to all Allies equally.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to reinforce our maritime posture and to protect our sea lines of communication.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the NATO Maritime Security Centre of Excellence in Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain awareness of any potential threats to our critical undersea infrastructure and will continue to address them nationally and, where needed, collectively.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the Full Operational Capability of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rapid Air Mobility which was activated and utilised by Allies for relief flights carrying critical supplies to Allies and partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.26.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to respond in a measured, balanced, coordinated, and timely way to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing and evolving array of conventional and nuclear-capable missiles, which is increasing in scale and complexity and which poses significant risks from all strategic directions to security and stability across the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to implement a coherent and balanced package of political and military measures to achieve Alliance objectives, including strengthened integrated air and missile defence; advanced defensive and offensive conventional capabilities; steps to keep NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deterrent safe, secure, and effective; efforts to support and strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation; intelligence; and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 We have no intention to deploy land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.27.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, which contributes to deterrence and defence and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO's capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions.28.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has enhanced its IAMD mission and we have taken steps to improve our IAMD forces\u00e2\u0080\u0099 readiness and responsiveness in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, strengthening our ability to ensure that all necessary measures are implemented for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We are taking into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats from state and non-state actors ranging from simple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles.29.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to work on NATO IAMD to ensure that it remains flexible and adaptive.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to effectively train and exercise their IAMD forces.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies have committed to improving NATO IAMD capabilities, including sensors, interceptors, and command and control, in particular through the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new IAMD Centre of Excellence in Greece.30.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience is essential for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a national responsibility and a collective commitment, anchored in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the significant progress achieved since our Resilience Commitment at the 2016 Warsaw Summit, we have agreed today a Strengthened Resilience Commitment that sets out further steps we intend to take in the coming years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to take a whole-of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of our societies, and achieving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil-military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagement with our populations, the private sector, and non-governmental actors; and the centres of expertise on resilience established by Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience in Romania.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, will maintain and enhance the security of our critical infrastructure, key industries, supply chains, and communication information networks, including 5G.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will further strengthen its own resilience, ensuring our ability to consult, decide, and act together. \u00c2\u00a0We will continue to work closely with our\u00c2\u00a0partners and other\u00c2\u00a0international organisations engaged in similar efforts in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.31.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Our nations continue to face threats and challenges from both state and non-state actors who use hybrid activities to target our political institutions, our public opinion, and the security of our citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 While the primary responsibility for responding to hybrid threats rests with the targeted nation, NATO is ready, upon Council decision, to assist an Ally at any stage of a hybrid campaign being conducted against it, including by deploying a Counter Hybrid Support Team.\u00c2\u00a0 In cases of hybrid warfare, the Council could decide to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as in the case of an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies will continue to prepare for, deter, and defend against\u00c2\u00a0hybrid threats.\u00c2\u00a0 Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing our situational awareness and expanding the tools at our disposal to\u00c2\u00a0counter hybrid threats,\u00c2\u00a0including disinformation campaigns,\u00c2\u00a0by developing comprehensive preventive and response options.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges.32.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance\u00c2\u00a0are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent.\u00c2\u00a0 This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm.\u00c2\u00a0 To face this evolving challenge, we have today endorsed NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which will support NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture, and further enhance our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 Reaffirming NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.\u00c2\u00a0 We will promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict by supporting international law and voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We will make greater use of NATO as a platform for political consultation among Allies, sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses.\u00c2\u00a0 If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us.\u00c2\u00a0 Our response need not be restricted to the cyber domain.\u00c2\u00a0 We will enhance our situational awareness to support NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision-making.\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience and the ability to detect, prevent, mitigate, and respond to vulnerabilities and intrusions is critical, as demonstrated by malicious cyber actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exploitation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO as an organisation will therefore continue to adapt and improve its cyber defences.\u00c2\u00a0 Five years since the adoption of our Cyber Defence Pledge, we remain committed to uphold strong national cyber defences as a matter of priority.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement cyberspace as a domain of operations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We will\u00c2\u00a0enhance the effective integration of\u00c2\u00a0sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into\u00c2\u00a0collective defence and Alliance operations and missions, in the framework of strong political oversight.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent opening of the NATO Communications and Information Academy in Portugal.33.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the growing importance of space for the security and prosperity of our nations and for NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Secure access to space services, products, and capabilities is essential for the conduct of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, missions and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We will accelerate our work to deepen and expand our use of space as an operational domain, including through the NATO Space Centre in Germany and the upcoming establishment of the Space Centre of Excellence in France, which we welcome.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s space domain awareness and better integrate space in our activities, including training and exercises, resilience, and innovation efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 Consistent with the Overarching Space Policy, NATO's approach to space will remain fully in line with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the international efforts to promote responsible behaviour in space.\u00c2\u00a0 We consider that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance, the impact of which could threaten national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability, and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.\u00c2\u00a0 Such attacks could lead to the invocation of Article 5.\u00c2\u00a0 A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.34.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to stand and act together in response to the challenging security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 As it continues to evolve, the Alliance will continue to respond and adapt as necessary.\u00c2\u00a0 Since the Warsaw Summit, we have established a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to improve our enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland through alignment with plans and by ensuring the ability of the four combat-ready battlegroups to operate with national home defence forces in an integrated manner.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored Forward Presence on land, at sea, and in the air in the Black Sea region, and we remain committed to its full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Our assurance measures, including exercises and various other air, land, and maritime activities, remain in place and continue to provide the fundamental baseline requirement for assurance and deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored assurance measures for Turkey, and we remain committed to their full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have a range of forces, including the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which are ready to deploy on short notice to respond to any contingencies and reinforce Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The full implementation of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Framework for the South, as an enduring component of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture, is ongoing.\u00c2\u00a0 Building on the progress achieved since 2016, including the establishment of the Hub for the South, we will continue to strengthen our capacity to deal with the threats and challenges emanating from the South, including in the Mediterranean Sea region and its approaches, by enhancing our strategic awareness, our plans, and the readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0 In the High North, we will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities in support of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security interests.\u00c2\u00a0 We will seek to strengthen cooperation with relevant and like-minded partners in the interests of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreed deterrence and defence objectives, in line with NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions, policies and procedures, as appropriate, and with consideration of political implications.35.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all aspects of the Defence Investment Pledge agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Fair burden sharing underpins the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cohesion, solidarity, credibility, and ability to fulfil our fundamental Article 3 and Article 5 commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We are, individually and collectively, committed to further improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of Alliance membership. \u00c2\u00a0We have made considerable progress since the Wales Summit with seven consecutive years of real growth in non-US defence expenditure, which reinforces our shared responsibility to provide capabilities to the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 All Allies have increased the amount they spend on defence in real terms and this trend is set to continue.\u00c2\u00a0 Since 2014, European Allies and Canada will have added 260 billion US dollars by the end of this year.\u00c2\u00a0 Furthermore, ten Allies are expected to spend 2% or more of GDP on defence this year.\u00c2\u00a0 About two-thirds of Allies plan to reach or exceed the 2% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally, 24 Allies are spending more than 20% of their defence expenditures on major equipment, including related research and development, and, according to their national plans, 27 Allies will meet the 20% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Our overall security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend it.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies continue to make valuable force and capability contributions that benefit the security of the Euro-Atlantic area through NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, missions, and other activities, as well as through the operations and missions conducted under national authority and the authority of other organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies invest considerable resources in preparing their forces, capabilities, and infrastructure for Alliance activities and Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operations.\u00c2\u00a0 In the years ahead, in line with the Defence Investment Pledge and building on the good progress to date, we affirm our commitment to continue our efforts as a matter of priority across the three pillars of cash, capabilities, and contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 We must and will do more.36.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are investing in our military capabilities in order to meet new and enduring challenges across all operational domains.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to deliver an array of robust and sophisticated capabilities across all domains, including heavier, more high-end, technologically advanced, better-supported forces and capabilities at the required readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve and adapt the sustainability, deployability, and interoperability of our capabilities for a demanding strategic environment, as well as high-end operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Our national capability development plans will support the full and timely implementation of the capabilities, in particular those required by the Alliance in line with the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 In light of the pace, breadth, and scale of technological developments, as we further develop our forces and capabilities, we recognise the vital importance of research and development and innovation to exploit the opportunities and to address the challenges posed by emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 This will help to ensure, individually and collectively, our technological edge now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue working to address, as appropriate, existing dependencies on Russian-sourced legacy military equipment through national efforts and multinational cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the modernisation of the NATO AWACS fleet and the progress of the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control programme, as well as the initial operations of the new Alliance Ground Surveillance Force.\u00c2\u00a0 Through NATO-supported multinational cooperation projects, Allies are committed to working together to develop or acquire new capabilities in key areas such as air-to-air refuelling, training, precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.37.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The speed of technological change has never been higher, creating both new opportunities and risks\u00c2\u00a0in the security environment and to the way NATO operates.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve our technological edge, and ensure Alliance interoperability, in order to maintain the credibility of our deterrence and defence posture.\u00c2\u00a0 We have recently taken important steps to that end, building on the Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) Roadmap we agreed in 2019, and have now adopted our strategy to foster and protect EDTs.\u00c2\u00a0 This strategy outlines a clear approach for identifying, developing, and adopting EDTs at the speed of relevance, guided by principles of responsible use, in accordance with\u00c2\u00a0international law,\u00c2\u00a0and taking into account discussions in relevant international fora.\u00c2\u00a0 Moreover, this strategy seeks to\u00c2\u00a0preserve our interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments by others, both now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Drawing on the extensive innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to maintain our technological edge.38.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territory and our populations against attack, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. \u00c2\u00a0No one should doubt NATO's resolve if the security of any of its members were to be threatened.\u00c2\u00a0 Faced with a highly diverse, complex, and demanding international security environment, NATO is determined to maintain the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our populations, wherever it should arise.39.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Credible deterrence and defence is essential as a means to prevent conflict and war and will continue to be based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 A robust deterrence and defence posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides an essential political and military transatlantic link, through an equitable and sustainable distribution of roles, responsibilities, and burdens.\u00c2\u00a0 We acknowledge the increasingly challenging security environment with risks arising from changes in the posture, doctrine, and behaviour of potential adversaries and their significant investments to develop, modernise, and expand capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to adapt and remains steadfast in its resolve to take all necessary steps to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture remains credible, coherent, resilient, and adaptable to the security environment.40.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal is to continue to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defence and to contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 In response to the more challenging security environment, NATO has taken steps to ensure its nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure, and effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 These Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned.\u00c2\u00a0 National contributions of dual-capable aircraft to NATO's nuclear deterrence mission remain central to this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in the agreed nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies concerned will continue to drive forward progress on sustaining leadership focus and institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to ensure greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture, strengthen effective strategic communications and enhance the effectiveness of NATO exercises to maintain and demonstrate a credible deterrence and reduce strategic risk.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO supports efforts towards strategic risk reduction which constitute important contributions to regional and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 In particular, transparency and dialogue can help avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.41.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.\u00c2\u00a0 Given the deteriorating security environment in Europe, a credible and united nuclear Alliance is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 Nuclear weapons are unique.\u00c2\u00a0 The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO reiterates that any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.\u00c2\u00a0 If the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened, however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve.42.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to continue to deliver a NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability, to pursue the Alliance's core task of collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is purely defensive.\u00c2\u00a0 The aim and political principles of NATO BMD remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 These principles are the indivisibility of Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security and NATO solidarity, equitable sharing of risks and burdens as well as reasonable challenge, taking into account the level of threat, affordability, and technical feasibility, and in accordance with the latest common threat assessments agreed by the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Should international efforts reduce the threats posed by ballistic missile proliferation, NATO missile defence can and will adapt accordingly.43.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Turkey, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Full Allied political control and oversight are essential, and full implementation will be ensured and monitored.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with third states on a case-by-case basis to enhance transparency, build mutual confidence, and increase ballistic missile defence effectiveness.44.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is not directed against Russia and will not undermine Russia's strategic deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is intended to defend against potential threats emanating from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We have explained to Russia many times that the BMD system is not capable against Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent and there is no intention to redesign this system to have such a capability in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Hence, Russian statements threatening to target Allies because of NATO BMD are unacceptable and counterproductive.\u00c2\u00a0 Should Russia be ready to discuss BMD with NATO, and subject to Alliance agreement, NATO remains open to the discussion.45.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.\u00c2\u00a0 After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 We regret that the conditions for achieving disarmament have not been realised since the 2018 Brussels NATO Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We welcome and fully support the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty for five years.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies believe the New START Treaty contributes to international stability, and Allies again express their strong support for its continued implementation and for early and active dialogue on ways to improve strategic stability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will welcome new strategic talks between the United States and Russia on future arms control measures, taking into account all Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will support further arms control negotiations, with the aim of improving the security of the Alliance, taking into account the prevailing international security environment.46.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains clear-eyed about the challenges Russia poses, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance will be guided by experience, not least Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s material breach of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which ultimately led to the termination of that agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to respond in a measured and responsible way to the significant risks posed by the Russian 9M729 missile, and other short- and intermediate-range missiles, to Allied security.\u00c2\u00a0 We have agreed a balanced, coordinated, and defensive package of measures to ensure NATO's deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective, including through potential arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal for a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe is inconsistent with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral and ongoing deployment of such systems on the continent and would not prevent Russia from building up such missiles outside of its European territory; this proposal is therefore not credible and not acceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 At the same time, NATO Allies remain open to meaningful arms control discussions and dialogue on reciprocal transparency and confidence-building measures that would take into account security interests of all Allies and increase security across the Alliance.47.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons, the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT in all its aspects, as an irreplaceable platform, and the strengthening of the NPT across its mutually reinforcing three pillars.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to working towards a meaningful outcome at the upcoming Tenth Review Conference, which presents a major opportunity to contribute to the preservation, universalisation, and full implementation of the NPT.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms its resolve to seek a safer world for all and to take further practical steps and effective measures to create the conditions for further nuclear disarmament negotiations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, including Article VI, in an ever more effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT, which remains the only credible path to nuclear disarmament.\u00c2\u00a0 The enduring success of the NPT cannot be taken for granted and requires sustained effort to further its achievements.\u00c2\u00a0 In this spirit, we call on all NPT States Parties to work together towards a successful Tenth Review Conference.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which is inconsistent with the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament.48.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO is not itself party to any arms control agreement, Allies will make best use of NATO as an important platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts that will support Alliance unity, political cohesion, and solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue actively to address the collapse of the INF Treaty due to Russian actions, and we are committed to maintain appropriate consultations among Allies on these issues.49.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain deeply concerned by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), as well as their means of delivery and related materials, by states and non-state actors, which represents a growing threat to our populations, territory, and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as use in Iraq, Russia, Malaysia, and, for the first time since NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundation on Allied territory, the United Kingdom.\u00c2\u00a0 The use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, for any reason is unacceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 There can be no impunity for those who use chemical weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We therefore welcome, as an important step towards accountability, the decision by the April 2021 Conference of the State Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to suspend Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and privileges under the CWC.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to uphold the CWC and the global norm against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and to hold those who use chemical weapons accountable for their actions, including through our joint commitment within the International Partnership Against the Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the full implementation of the CWC and the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in addressing WMD threats and condemn those who seek to impede its work.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to ensuring that Allies can protect their populations, forces, and territories against CBRN threats, including through reviewing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comprehensive, Strategic Level Policy for Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Defending against CBRN Threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united in our resolve to promote the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline the need to bring the treaty into force and we support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\u00c2\u00a0Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission, including the International Data Centre and International Monitoring System.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.\u00c2\u00a0 In the meantime, the Alliance calls on all states to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.50.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We remain committed to conventional arms control as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve, strengthen, and modernise conventional arms control in Europe, based on key principles and commitments, including reciprocity, transparency, and host nation consent.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing aggressive military posture, its refusal to fully comply with its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, its ongoing selective implementation of the Vienna Document, and its long-standing failure to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, continue to undermine security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies call on Russia to return to full implementation of, and compliance with the letter and spirit of all of its international obligations and commitments, which is essential to rebuilding trust and confidence, military transparency and increasing predictability in the Euro-Atlantic region.\u00c2\u00a0 We specifically call on Russia to be open and transparent about its no-notice snap exercises, large-scale exercises and large-scale troop movements, in accordance with its Vienna Document commitments, particularly in light of its recent unprovoked and unjustified military build-up in and around Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies underscore the importance of modernising the Vienna Document, and welcome the broad support for its comprehensive modernisation package.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to intensified discussions in the Forum for Security Cooperation leading to consensus on an updated Vienna Document at the 2021 OSCE Ministerial.\u00c2\u00a0 To maintain the contributions of the Treaty on Open Skies to the security of all State Parties, it is essential that all State Parties fully implement its provisions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to actively support ongoing discussions at the OSCE, including the Structured Dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to engage constructively on all these efforts.51.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full support to the goal of the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea, in accordance with relevant UNSCRs.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on the Democratic People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to engage in meaningful negotiations with the United States towards achieving this goal.\u00c2\u00a0 We urge the DPRK to fully implement its international obligations; to eliminate its nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capabilities and ballistic missiles; to return to the NPT and its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and to abandon all related programmes.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on nations to fully implement existing UN sanctions.52.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We are committed to ensuring that Iran will never develop a nuclear weapon.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the substantive discussions between Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) participants, and separately with the United States, to accomplish a mutual return to compliance with the JCPoA by the United States and Iran.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the goal of restoring the non-proliferation benefits of the JCPoA and of ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear programme.\u00c2\u00a0 It is vital that Iran preserves the space for these discussions by avoiding any further escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly support the IAEA in its crucial monitoring and verification work to help ensure Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance with the NPT-related safeguards obligations, as well as its other commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 A restored and fully implemented JCPoA could also pave the way to further address regional and security concerns, including in support of the non-proliferation regime.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, including through financing, training, and the proliferation of missile technology and weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231, refrain from destabilising actions, and play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace.Syria retains an inventory of short-range ballistic missiles whose range covers parts of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory and some of our partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 territories.\u00c2\u00a0 Syria has used these missiles extensively against its own population.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain vigilant over missile launches from Syria which could again hit or target Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We continue to monitor and assess the ballistic missile threat from Syria.The increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the vicinity of the south-eastern border of the Alliance has been, and remains a driver in NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development and deployment of a ballistic missile defence system, which is configured to counter threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.53.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in Syria has entered its eleventh year and continues to have significant consequences on the stability of the region and the security of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s south-eastern border.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned and vigilant over its ramifications.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our determination to defend NATO territory and borders against any threats and to address challenges emanating from Syria.\u00c2\u00a0 The presidential elections held on 26 May 2021 by the Syrian regime cannot be considered as free and fair and do not contribute to the efforts to achieve a political solution.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline that stability and security cannot be reinstated in Syria without a genuine political process in line with UNSCR 2254.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for a nationwide ceasefire and the reauthorisation and expansion of the UN cross-border humanitarian assistance for a period of at least 12\u00c2\u00a0months in order to meet the needs of the Syrian people.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our appreciation to our Ally Turkey for hosting millions of Syrian refugees.54.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain deeply concerned about developments in Belarus since August 2020.\u00c2\u00a0 The policies and actions of Belarus have implications for regional stability and have violated the principles which underpin our partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will remain vigilant\u00c2\u00a0of and monitor the implications for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 The\u00c2\u00a0unacceptable diversion of a civilian aircraft in May 2021 and the subsequent arrest of a journalist and his partner travelling on board endangered the safety of civilians and was a grave affront to political dissent and freedom of the press.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the independent investigations, including by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\u00c2\u00a0 We support measures taken by Allies individually and collectively in response to this incident.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Belarus to abide by international law, respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including those belonging to the Union of Poles in Belarus.\u00c2\u00a0 A democratic, sovereign, and stable Belarus is in all of our interests.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies stand ready for a mutually beneficial NATO-Belarus partnership, taking into account political and security conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will follow the scale, scope, and aftermath of the Zapad-2021 exercise, and continue to call on Russia and Belarus to act in a predictable, transparent way in compliance with their international obligations and OSCE commitments.55.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are concerned by those coercive policies which stand in contrast to the fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad.\u00c2\u00a0 It is opaque in implementing its military modernisation and its publicly declared military-civil fusion strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 It is also cooperating militarily with Russia, including through participation in Russian exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on China to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains, in keeping with its role as a major power.56.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO maintains a constructive dialogue with China where possible.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on our interests, we welcome opportunities to engage with China on areas of relevance to the Alliance and on common challenges such as climate change.\u00c2\u00a0 There is value in information exchange on respective policies and activities, to enhance awareness and discuss potential disagreements.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge China to engage meaningfully in dialogue, confidence-building, and transparency measures regarding its nuclear capabilities and doctrine.\u00c2\u00a0 Reciprocal transparency and understanding would benefit both NATO and China.57.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are working together as an Alliance and with like-minded partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect critical infrastructure, strengthen resilience, maintain our technological edge, and address these challenges to the rules-based international order.58.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a threat multiplier that impacts Allied security, both in the Euro-Atlantic area and in the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader neighbourhood.\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Today we have endorsed an Action Plan to implement our NATO Agenda on Climate Change and Security, which increases our awareness, adaptation, mitigation, and outreach efforts, while ensuring a credible deterrence and defence posture and upholding the priorities of the safety of military personnel and operational and cost effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 To increase awareness, NATO will conduct annual assessments of the impact of climate change on its strategic environment as well as on missions and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 To adapt to climate change, NATO will incorporate climate change considerations into its full spectrum of work, ranging from defence planning and capability development to civil preparedness and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, drawing on best practices of Allies, and taking into account their different national circumstances, NATO will develop a mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations, which\u00c2\u00a0could contribute to formulating voluntary goals to reduce such emissions.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also strengthen exchanges with partner countries as well as with international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security issues.59.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Energy security plays an important role in our common security.\u00c2\u00a0 A stable and reliable energy supply, the diversification of routes, suppliers, and energy resources, including the integration of sustainable energy sources, and the interconnectivity of energy networks, are all of critical importance and increase our resilience against political and economic pressure.\u00c2\u00a0 It is essential to ensure that the members of the Alliance are not vulnerable to political or coercive manipulation of energy, which constitutes a potential threat.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will therefore continue to seek further\u00c2\u00a0diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 While these issues are primarily the responsibility of national authorities, energy developments can have significant political and security implications for Allies and also affect our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Consequently, we will continue to enhance our strategic awareness, including through regular Allied consultations and intelligence sharing, and will strengthen our links with relevant international organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further develop NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical infrastructure, including against malicious hybrid and cyber activity.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure reliable energy supplies to our military forces.60.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has long recognised the importance of Human Security, which focuses on risks and threats to populations in conflict or crisis areas and how to mitigate and respond to them.\u00c2\u00a0 Taking a Human Security approach is a reflection of our values and makes us more operationally effective.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that all efforts are made to avoid, minimise, and mitigate any potential negative effects on civilians arising from our missions or activities, as underscored in our Policy for the Protection of Civilians.\u00c2\u00a0 Today,\u00c2\u00a0we endorse\u00c2\u00a0NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Policy on Preventing and Responding to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, a landmark demonstration of our commitment to addressing such violence, which inflicts long-term stigma\u00c2\u00a0and trauma on individuals and families, contributes to their marginalisation, destroys the social fabric of communities, triggers displacement, fuels armed actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activities, fosters prolonged conflict and instability, and is an impediment to sustainable peace and reconciliation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are updating our policy on combating trafficking in human beings.\u00c2\u00a0 Our ongoing work on Human Security also includes Children and Armed Conflict and Cultural Property Protection.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to work with its partners, international organisations, and civil society to further our Human Security agenda, which includes robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in support of lasting peace and security and our populations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 common defence.61.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the critical importance of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, as well as the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including conflict-related sexual violence, we are committed to fully implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Policy and Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security better prepare the Alliance to address the challenges of today and tomorrow.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Policy on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, agreed in 2019, reinforces our commitment to hold ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour, in keeping with our values.\u00c2\u00a0 Working together with partners, international organisations, and civil society, we will consistently continue to implement our policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, and activities.62.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Building Integrity Policy and Programme.\u00c2\u00a0 Corruption and poor governance undermine democracy, the rule of law, and economic development, thus constituting challenges to our security.\u00c2\u00a0 Implementing measures to improve integrity building, to fight against corruption, and to foster good governance is of continued importance for NATO, Allies, and partners alike.63.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnerships is demonstrated by their strategic contribution to Alliance and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 They play an important role in supporting NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.\u00c2\u00a0 They are central to advancing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperative security agenda, helping to shape our security environment, and contributing to stability in the Euro-Atlantic area, and to the pursuit of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political and military objectives.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent, and more effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner relationships are also\u00c2\u00a0based on reciprocity, mutual benefit and mutual respect.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise their sacrifices for Euro-Atlantic and international security over the years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve interoperability, in particular with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising that conflict and instability in NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbourhood directly undermine Allied security, we will continue to intensify NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance and capacity building support to our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to expand political dialogue and practical cooperation with any nation that shares the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values and interest in international peace and security and will further develop our partnerships so that they continue to meet the interests of both Allies and partners.\u00c2\u00a0 In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO's own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations.64.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO-EU strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence.\u00c2\u00a0 The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.\u00c2\u00a0 Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.\u00c2\u00a0 Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU's efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fullest involvement in these efforts is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to further strengthen our strategic partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations.65.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO-EU cooperation has reached unprecedented levels, with tangible results in countering hybrid and cyber threats, strategic communication, operational cooperation including maritime issues, military mobility, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, exercises, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance this cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to develop and deepen our cooperation by fully implementing the common set of 74 proposals, which contribute to the coherence and complementarity of our efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 The current strategic environment and the COVID pandemic underscore the importance of NATO-EU cooperation in the face of current and evolving security challenges, in particular in addressing resilience issues, emerging and disruptive technologies, the security implications of climate change, disinformation, and the growing geostrategic competition.\u00c2\u00a0 The ongoing distinct strategic processes within NATO and the EU offer a unique opportunity to intensify further our consultations and cooperation to enhance the security of our citizens and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond, while reaffirming that NATO remains the transatlantic framework for strong collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the Secretary General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued close cooperation with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the High Representative, on all aspects of the NATO-EU strategic partnership.66.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, which has been a historic success.\u00c2\u00a0 North Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accession last year is yet another tangible demonstration of this commitment.\u00c2\u00a0 Successive rounds of enlargement have strengthened Euro-Atlantic security by helping to spread and consolidate the rule of law and democratic institutions and practices across the European continent, and have respected the right of all states to seek their own security arrangements, as enshrined in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door remains open to all European democracies which share the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, which are in a position to further the principles of the Treaty, and whose inclusion can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself; no third party has a say in that process.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We remain committed to the integration of those countries that aspire to join the Alliance, judging each on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage them to continue to implement the necessary reforms and decisions to prepare for membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to offer support to their efforts and look to them to take the steps necessary to advance their aspirations.67.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements, encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to avoid divisive rhetoric.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aspirant country, for its contributions to NATO-led operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to maintaining strong political dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and offer our continued support to the implementation of all reform efforts, including through NATO HQ Sarajevo.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take full advantage of the breadth of NATO cooperative security and partnership tools.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies welcome the work of the Commission for Cooperation with NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge political leaders to work constructively and to demonstrate political will for the benefit of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina in advancing Euro-Atlantic aspirations by implementing the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, including through the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reform Programme with NATO, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership.68.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 As an Enhanced Opportunities Partner, Georgia is cooperating closely with the Alliance across a wide range of issues.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly appreciate Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent political agreement on the Way Ahead for Georgia and encourage its full implementation by all sides.\u00c2\u00a0 This agreement paves the way for the important reforms which will help Georgia, an aspirant country, progress in its preparations towards membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme in deepening political dialogue and cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the significant progress on reforms which Georgia has made and must continue to make, and which have helped Georgia strengthen its defence capabilities and interoperability with the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the Alliance contains all the practical tools to prepare for eventual membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We are working closely with Georgia on security in the Black Sea region, in response to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly destabilising activities, and welcome the steps taken to implement the refreshed Substantial NATO-Georgia Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand ready to enhance our support to Georgia, including in building resilience against hybrid threats, in training and exercises, and in secure communications.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to the next NATO-Georgia exercise in 2022.69.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 The Annual National Programmes under the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) remain the mechanism by which Ukraine takes forward the reforms pertaining to its aspiration for NATO membership.\u00c2\u00a0 Ukraine should make full use of all instruments available under the NUC to reach its objective of implementing NATO principles and standards.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of wide-ranging, sustainable, and irreversible reforms, including combating corruption, promoting an inclusive political process, and decentralisation reform, based on democratic values, respect for human rights, minorities, and the rule of law, will be crucial in laying the groundwork for a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Further reforms in the security sector, including the reform of the Security Services of Ukraine, are particularly important.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome significant reforms already made by Ukraine and strongly encourage further progress in line with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international obligations and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to provide practical support to reform in the security and defence sector, including through the Comprehensive Assistance Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to strengthen its resilience against hybrid threats, including through intensifying activities under the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the cooperation between NATO and Ukraine with regard to security in the Black Sea region.\u00c2\u00a0 The Enhanced Opportunities Partner status granted last year provides further impetus to our already ambitious cooperation and will promote greater interoperability, with the option of more joint exercises, training, and enhanced situational awareness.\u00c2\u00a0 Military cooperation and capacity building initiatives between Allies and Ukraine,\u00c2\u00a0including the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, further reinforce this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly value Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant contributions to Allied operations, the NATO Response Force, and NATO exercises.70.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO, as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans and to supporting the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the countries in the region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will intensify our efforts in the region and enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reform efforts, promote regional peace and security, and counter the malign influence of outside actors.\u00c2\u00a0 Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the NATO-Serbia partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.71.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) which contributes to a safe and secure environment and to wider stability in the Western Balkans, and through ongoing capacity building efforts with the Kosovo security organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Any changes to our force posture in KFOR remain conditions-based and not calendar-driven.72.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close and mutually beneficial security cooperation with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners Finland and Sweden, which share our values and contribute to NATO-led operations and missions, has grown across a wide range of areas.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to any common challenges and to work together on enhancing our resilience and civil preparedness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will bolster our regular and open political dialogue and cooperation in support of our common security, including by crisis management preparation, exercises, and exchanging information and analysis, notably on the security situation in the Baltic Sea region.73.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will work more closely with all our Western European partners to share expertise, address emerging security challenges, and continue our cooperation on operations, missions, and other initiatives.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also seek to further develop relations with our partners\u00c2\u00a0across the globe.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing political dialogue and practical cooperation with our long-standing Asia-Pacific partners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to promote cooperative security and support the rules-based international order.\u00c2\u00a0 We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared concerns.\u00c2\u00a0 We are intensifying our interaction with Colombia, NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner in Latin America, on good governance, military training, interoperability, demining, and maritime security.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to deepening our political dialogue and intensifying our practical cooperation with our partners in Central Asia, taking into account the regional situation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the interest of other global actors to work with NATO in addressing our shared security concerns and stand ready to explore further engagement on a case-by-case basis.74.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to enhancing our long-standing engagement in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen our political dialogue and practical cooperation with our Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) partners.\u00c2\u00a0 This will build stronger security and defence institutions and capacities, promote interoperability, and help to counter terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We have upgraded our defence capacity building assistance to Jordan, our Enhanced Opportunities Partner, to include additional counter-terrorism support, and have contributed to the establishment of the new Military Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Training Centre.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our engagement with Tunisia on defence capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 We will leverage the NATO-ICI Regional Centre in Kuwait as an important hub for education, training, and public diplomacy activities, and we remain open to the potential establishment of other education and training centres with interested MENA countries.\u00c2\u00a0 Our Regional Hub for the South, in Naples, is making tangible progress in implementing its four functions and contributing to our situational awareness and understanding.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with the African Union and further develop our relations with the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council in order to enhance our ability\u00c2\u00a0to better\u00c2\u00a0address mutual security concerns.75.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The deteriorating situation in the Sahel region matters to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 This\u00c2\u00a0region is a theatre of complex and interconnected challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to the Sahel is currently focused on our long-standing partnership with Mauritania, and we are looking into providing additional advice and training support.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to engage in dialogue with relevant NATO partners, representatives from the Sahel region, international and regional organisations and entities such as the African Union, the G5 Sahel structures, the UN, and the EU, as well as with the Coalition for the Sahel.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will enhance its engagement with the G5 Sahel structures and remains open, upon request, to consider further engagements in the region.76.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The crisis in Libya has direct implications for regional stability and the security of all Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the progress achieved in Libya, including the recent endorsement of the interim Government of National Unity (GNU) and Presidency Council.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the UN efforts in support of a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, aimed at promoting national reconciliation as well as unifying and strengthening state institutions.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on all the relevant Libyan authorities and institutions, including the GNU and the House of Representatives, to take actions set out in the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum roadmap and to make the necessary preparations for free, fair, and inclusive national Presidential and Parliamentary elections on 24\u00c2\u00a0December\u00c2\u00a02021.\u00c2\u00a0 We fully\u00c2\u00a0support the implementation of UNSCRs 2570 and 2571 and the 23 October 2020 ceasefire agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with our Summit decisions, we remain committed to providing advice to Libya, upon its request, in the area of defence and security institution building, taking into account political and security conditions.77.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is an Alliance that constantly modernises and adapts to new threats and challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is also adapting as an institution.\u00c2\u00a0 To enhance our political-military coherence and situational awareness, we have restructured the activities of the NATO Headquarters, and established a Chief Information Officer function.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome and will continue progress towards an optimised NATO intelligence enterprise, better postured to provide timely and relevant support to Alliance operations and decision-making on contemporary and future challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also further strengthen the security of our cyber and communications systems and continue to protect the Alliance against espionage attempts.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continuously pursue greater coherence, improved effectiveness, and new efficiencies, in support of the flexibility and responsiveness we need as an Alliance.78.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We express our deep appreciation for the generous hospitality extended to NATO by the Government and the people of Belgium for over five decades, and to us today on the occasion of our Summit meeting at NATO Headquarters.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to all the men and women in uniform who continue to work daily for our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 And we extend a special word of thanks to all those who made it possible for us to have a safe and productive Summit meeting despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the NATO medical personnel and the Polish Medical Emergency Detachment.79.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 With our decisions today, we have opened a new chapter in the transatlantic relationship and set the direction for the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued adaptation towards 2030 and beyond.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to meeting again in Spain in 2022, followed by our next meeting in Lithuania.\n1.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We, the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies, have gathered in Brussels to reaffirm our unity, solidarity, and cohesion, and to open a new chapter in transatlantic relations, at a time when the security environment we face is increasingly complex.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains the foundation of our collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is a defensive Alliance and will continue to strive for peace, security, and stability in the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain firmly committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founding Washington Treaty, including that an attack against one Ally shall be considered an attack against us all, as enshrined in Article 5.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to pursue a 360-degree approach to protect and defend our indivisible security and to fulfil NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management, and cooperative security.\n2.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is the strongest and most successful Alliance in history.\u00c2\u00a0 It guarantees the security of our territory and our one billion citizens, our freedom, and the values we share, including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.\u00c2\u00a0 We are bound together by our common values, enshrined in the Washington Treaty, the bedrock of our unity, solidarity, and cohesion.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to fulfiling our responsibilities as Allies accordingly.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to the rules-based international order.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to reinforce consultations when the security or stability of an Ally is threatened or when our fundamental values and principles are at risk.\n3.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We face multifaceted threats, systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers, as well as growing security challenges to our countries and our citizens from all strategic directions.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security; terrorism in all its forms and manifestations remains a persistent threat to us all.\u00c2\u00a0 State and non-state actors challenge the rules-based international order and seek to undermine democracy across the globe.\u00c2\u00a0 Instability beyond our borders is also contributing to irregular migration and human trafficking.\u00c2\u00a0 China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We will engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We are increasingly confronted by cyber, hybrid, and other asymmetric threats, including disinformation campaigns, and by the malicious use of ever-more sophisticated emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 Rapid advances in the space domain are affecting our security.\u00c2\u00a0 The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the erosion of the arms control architecture also undermine our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change is a threat multiplier that impacts Alliance security.\u00c2\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territories and our populations against attack, and we will address all threats and challenges which affect Euro-Atlantic security.\n4.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We gather at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic continues to test our nations and our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allied militaries have supported the civilian response to the pandemic, while ensuring our collective defence and the effectiveness of our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We have also provided critical assistance to a number of partners through the delivery of vital medical supplies.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to all those who combat this pandemic in our countries and around the world.\n5.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 At our December 2019 meeting in London, we asked the Secretary General to carry out a forward-looking reflection process to further strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political dimension, including consultations.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the important contribution of the independent group appointed by the Secretary General to support NATO 2030.\u00c2\u00a0 As a result, today we agree NATO 2030 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a transatlantic agenda for the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Throughout its history, NATO has continuously adapted to a changing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda complements and builds on our ongoing political and military adaptation, strengthens our ability to deliver on the three core tasks and contributes to making our strong Alliance even stronger and ready for the future.\n6.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 To that end we agree to:\n7.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda sets a higher level of ambition for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 It provides clear guidelines for further adaptation to address existing, new and future threats and challenges, building on the ongoing political and military adaptation of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Delivering on the NATO 2030 agenda, the three core tasks and the next Strategic Concept requires adequate resourcing through national defence expenditure and common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on requirements, we agree to increase such resourcing, including as necessary NATO common funding starting in 2023, taking into account sustainability, affordability and accountability.\u00c2\u00a0 When we meet in 2022, we will agree, alongside the Strategic Concept, the specific requirements for additional funding up to 2030 and the resource implications across the NATO Military Budget, the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Civil Budget, as well as identify potential efficiency measures.\n8.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means.\u00c2\u00a0 The evolving security environment increasingly requires us to address threats and challenges through the use of military and non-military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will take a tailored and structured approach.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It also serves as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication as an essential element to support all three of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core tasks.\n9.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 For more than twenty-five years, NATO has worked to build a partnership with Russia, including through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO stands by its international commitments, Russia continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the NATO-Russia relationship.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our decisions towards Russia agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit and all our subsequent NATO meetings.\u00c2\u00a0 We have suspended all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while remaining open to political dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 Until Russia demonstrates compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities, there can be no return to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbusiness as usual\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions we have taken are fully consistent with our international commitments, and therefore cannot be regarded by anyone as contradicting the NATO-Russia Founding Act.\n10.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to rescind the designation of the Czech Republic and the United States as \u00e2\u0080\u009cunfriendly countries\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to refrain from taking any other steps inconsistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n11.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing multi-domain military build-up, more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, the continued military build-up in Crimea, the deployment of modern dual-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, military integration with Belarus, and repeated violations of NATO Allied airspace, increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond.\n12.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to its military activities, Russia has also intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.\u00c2\u00a0 This includes attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; political and economic pressure and intimidation; widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory, including those who target and disrupt critical infrastructure in NATO countries.\u00c2\u00a0 It also includes illegal and destructive activities by Russian Intelligence Services on Allied territory, some of which have claimed lives of citizens and caused widespread material damage.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand in full solidarity with the Czech Republic and other Allies that have been affected in this way.\n13.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has continued to diversify its nuclear arsenal, including by deploying a suite of short- and intermediate-range missile systems that are intended to coerce NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia has recapitalised roughly 80 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is expanding its nuclear capabilities by pursuing novel and destabilising weapons and a diverse array of dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia continues to use aggressive and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and has increased its ongoing emphasis on destabilising conventional exercises that include dual-capable systems.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear strategy and comprehensive nuclear weapon systems modernisation, diversification, and expansion, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons, increasingly support a more aggressive posture of strategic intimidation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to work closely together to address all the threats and challenges posed by Russia.\n14.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova within their internationally recognised borders.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with its international commitments, we call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in all three countries without their consent.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\u00c2\u00a0 The human rights abuses and violations against the Crimean Tatars and members of other local communities must end.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent massive military build-up and destabilising activities in and around Ukraine have further escalated tensions and undermined security.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to reverse its military build-up and stop restricting navigation in parts of the Black Sea.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to stop impeding access to the Sea of Azov and Ukrainian ports.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture of restraint and diplomatic approach in this context.\u00c2\u00a0 We seek to contribute to de-escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up our support to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements by all sides, and support the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia, as a signatory of the Minsk Agreements, bears significant responsibility in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to stop fuelling the conflict by providing financial and military support to the armed formations it backs in eastern Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our full support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 We stress the importance of ensuring its safety and full and unhindered access throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and the Russia-Ukraine border, in accordance with its mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia as independent states; to implement the EU-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement; to end its militarisation of these regions and attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the continued construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our firm support to the Geneva International Discussions.\u00c2\u00a0 We also call on Russia to engage constructively in the Transnistria Settlement Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to supporting the Republic of Moldova\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democratic reforms and providing assistance through our Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative.\n15.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to a periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue with a Russia willing to engage on the basis of reciprocity in the NRC, with a view to avoiding misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, and to increase transparency and predictability.\u00c2\u00a0 NRC meetings have helped us communicate clearly our positions, and we are ready for the next meeting of the NRC.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to focus our dialogue with Russia on the critical issues we face.\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in and around Ukraine is, in current circumstances, the first topic on our agenda.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to making good use of the existing military lines of communication between both sides to promote predictability and transparency, and to reduce risks, and calls on Russia to do so as well.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia when its actions make that possible.\n16.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, continues to pose a direct threat to the security of our populations, and to international stability and prosperity.\u00c2\u00a0 We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 While nations retain the primary responsibility for their domestic security and their own resilience, the fight against terrorism demands a coherent, long-term effort by the international community as a whole, involving a wide range of instruments and actors.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance, and is an integral part of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Cooperation in NATO adds value to Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 national efforts and capacity to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and be resilient against acts of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn all financial support of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We also recognise the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on the fight against terrorism.\n17.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain fully committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enhanced role in the international community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight against terrorism, including through awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement our 2019 Action Plan and will update it by the end of this year, to take account of the evolving terrorist threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to meet our commitments under UNSCR 2396, including through NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Battlefield Evidence Policy, supported by improved information and data collection, preservation, sharing, and analysis, within NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mandate.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our work to defend against improvised explosive devices and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing capabilities to protect our forces against terrorist misuse of technology, while capitalising on emerging technologies to help us in the fight against terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We are also stepping up support to partner countries to fight terrorism themselves and deny terrorists safe haven, which in turn strengthens NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with partner countries and other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to play its part in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh, including through our Airborne Warning\u00c2\u00a0& Control System (AWACS) surveillance flights and staff-to-staff support.\n18.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 After almost 20 years, NATO's military operations in Afghanistan are coming to an end.\u00c2\u00a0 We have denied terrorists a safe haven from which to plot attacks against us, helped Afghanistan to build its security institutions, and trained, advised, and assisted the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces; they are now taking on full responsibility for security in their country.\u00c2\u00a0 We pay tribute to those who have lost their lives or have been wounded, and express our deep appreciation to all the men and women who have served under the NATO flag, and to their families.\n19.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Withdrawing our troops does not mean ending our relationship with Afghanistan.\u00c2\u00a0 We will now open a new chapter.\u00c2\u00a0 We affirm our commitment to continue to stand with Afghanistan, its people, and its institutions in promoting security and upholding thehard-won gains of the last 20 years.\u00c2\u00a0 Recalling our previous commitments, NATO will continue to provide training and financial support to the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces, including through the Afghan National Army Trust Fund.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will retain a Senior Civilian Representative's Office in Kabul to continue diplomatic engagement and enhance our partnership with Afghanistan.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising its importance to an enduring diplomatic and international presence, as well as to Afghanistan's connectivity with the world, NATO will provide transitional funding to ensure continued functioning of Hamid Karzai International Airport.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also step up dialogue on Afghanistan with relevant international and regional partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to support the ongoing Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process, and call on all stakeholders to help Afghanistan foster a lasting inclusive political settlement that puts an end to violence; safeguards the human rights of Afghans, particularly women, children, and minorities; upholds the rule of law; and ensures that Afghanistan never again serves as a safe haven for terrorists.\n20.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains a leading and active contributor to international security through operations, missions, and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their substantial contributions to these efforts. \u00c2\u00a0NATO and Allies support Iraq in its fight against ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued efforts to combat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on a request from the Iraqi Government, we will strengthen our support to Iraq through our NATO Mission Iraq.\u00c2\u00a0 We will broaden our non-combat advisory, training, and capacity building mission to support Iraq in building more effective, sustainable, accountable, and inclusive security institutions and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 This expansion of NATO Mission Iraq, including additional support to the Iraqi security institutions, will be demand-driven, incremental, scalable, and based on conditions on the ground.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors, including the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099esh, the United Nations, and the European Union.\n21.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united and resolute in our ability and commitment to defend one another.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain and further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to ensure credible deterrence and defence and provide the Alliance with a wide range of options to tailor our response to specific circumstances and to respond to any threats, from state and non-state actors, from wherever they arise, and potentially from multiple directions in more than one region simultaneously.\u00c2\u00a0 While reaffirming our commitment to the three core tasks, we have placed a renewed emphasis on collective defence, and have also ensured that NATO retains the ability to project stability and fight against terrorism.\n22.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the significant progress already made to implement our previous decisions to strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture and reaffirm our commitment to their full and speedy implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have accelerated our military adaptation with increased defence spending, modern capabilities, enhanced political and military responsiveness, and higher readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0NATO is taking forward a new military strategy through the implementation of two significant military concepts that will further strengthen our ability to deter and defend against any potential adversary and to maintain and develop our military advantage now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 The deterrence and defence concept provides a single, coherent framework to contest\u00c2\u00a0and deter and defend against the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main threats in a multi-domain environment, and will strengthen our preparedness to address challenges, particularly pervasive instability and strategic shocks. \u00c2\u00a0The warfighting concept provides a long-term vision for maintaining and developing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisive military edge.\u00c2\u00a0 The implementation of the deterrence and defence concept will guide enhanced advance planning to respond to potential crisis and conflict, as well as further improve the use and organisation of Allied forces and capabilities in all operational domains and ensure more effective command and control.\u00c2\u00a0 We are developing strategic, domain-specific and regional military plans to improve our ability to respond to any contingencies and ensure timely reinforcement.\u00c2\u00a0 We will emphasise persistent activities in peacetime to support deterrence, including through the presence and dynamic posture of our military forces and exercises, based on enhanced coordination amongst Allies and NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Through the implementation of the warfighting concept, we will ensure that the Alliance continuously develops its military and technological advantage, as the character of conflict evolves.\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to the full implementation of these new concepts, and to taking the necessary steps to enhance the coherence between relevant national and NATO activities and plans and the concepts.\n23.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We commit to further strengthening and modernising the NATO Force Structure to meet current and future deterrence and defence needs.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure a flexible, agile, and resilient multi-domain force architecture with the right forces in the right place at the right time.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen modern command and control tailored to support our 360-degree posture, dynamic force management, improved response system, and plans.\u00c2\u00a0 In doing so, we will place increased emphasis on the interdependence of geography, domains, and readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 As part of these overall efforts, we are committed to continue increasing the readiness of our forces and the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rapid response capability, including through the ongoing implementation of the NATO Readiness Initiative, which is designed to strengthen the culture of readiness and help to provide forces at 30 days readiness or less.\u00c2\u00a0 We have sourced all the combat forces of the NATO Readiness Initiative with 30 major naval combatants, 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, and 30 kinetic air squadrons.\u00c2\u00a0 They are being organised and trained as larger combat formations for reinforcement and high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis intervention.\n24.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure that the NATO Command Structure is robust, resilient, and able to undertake all elements of effective command and control for simultaneous challenges across all domains and the full spectrum of missions, including large-scale operations for collective defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Our two new commands, Joint Force Command Norfolk headquarters and Joint Support and Enabling Command, as well as the Cyberspace Operations Centre, have achieved Initial Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allied contributions to command and control through the NATO Force Structure and national headquarters as well as their strengthened relationship with the NATO Command Structure, including by providing host nation support, remain essential to improve the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional understanding, vigilance, and ability to rapidly respond to any threat from any direction.\n25.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will not be constrained by any potential adversary as regards the freedom of movement of Allied forces by land, air, or sea to and within any part of Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 Our deterrence and defence posture is underpinned by credible forces, both in-place and ready for reinforcement within Europe and from across the Atlantic.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to give high priority, both nationally and in the Alliance, to ensuring enablement of SACEUR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Area of Responsibility to improve our ability to support the deployment and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory.\u00c2\u00a0 These efforts include taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate that NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies with the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued, including with regard to military mobility related procedures that should apply to all Allies equally.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to reinforce our maritime posture and to protect our sea lines of communication.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the NATO Maritime Security Centre of Excellence in Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0 We will maintain awareness of any potential threats to our critical undersea infrastructure and will continue to address them nationally and, where needed, collectively.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the Full Operational Capability of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rapid Air Mobility which was activated and utilised by Allies for relief flights carrying critical supplies to Allies and partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n26.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to respond in a measured, balanced, coordinated, and timely way to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing and evolving array of conventional and nuclear-capable missiles, which is increasing in scale and complexity and which poses significant risks from all strategic directions to security and stability across the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to implement a coherent and balanced package of political and military measures to achieve Alliance objectives, including strengthened integrated air and missile defence; advanced defensive and offensive conventional capabilities; steps to keep NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deterrent safe, secure, and effective; efforts to support and strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation; intelligence; and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 We have no intention to deploy land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.\n27.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, which contributes to deterrence and defence and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO's capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions.\n28.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has enhanced its IAMD mission and we have taken steps to improve our IAMD forces\u00e2\u0080\u0099 readiness and responsiveness in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, strengthening our ability to ensure that all necessary measures are implemented for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We are taking into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats from state and non-state actors ranging from simple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles.\n29.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will continue to work on NATO IAMD to ensure that it remains flexible and adaptive.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to effectively train and exercise their IAMD forces.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies have committed to improving NATO IAMD capabilities, including sensors, interceptors, and command and control, in particular through the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new IAMD Centre of Excellence in Greece.\n30.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience is essential for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s core tasks.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a national responsibility and a collective commitment, anchored in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the significant progress achieved since our Resilience Commitment at the 2016 Warsaw Summit, we have agreed today a Strengthened Resilience Commitment that sets out further steps we intend to take in the coming years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to take a whole-of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of our societies, and achieving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil-military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagement with our populations, the private sector, and non-governmental actors; and the centres of expertise on resilience established by Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience in Romania.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, will maintain and enhance the security of our critical infrastructure, key industries, supply chains, and communication information networks, including 5G.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will further strengthen its own resilience, ensuring our ability to consult, decide, and act together. \u00c2\u00a0We will continue to work closely with our\u00c2\u00a0partners and other\u00c2\u00a0international organisations engaged in similar efforts in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.\n31.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Our nations continue to face threats and challenges from both state and non-state actors who use hybrid activities to target our political institutions, our public opinion, and the security of our citizens.\u00c2\u00a0 While the primary responsibility for responding to hybrid threats rests with the targeted nation, NATO is ready, upon Council decision, to assist an Ally at any stage of a hybrid campaign being conducted against it, including by deploying a Counter Hybrid Support Team.\u00c2\u00a0 In cases of hybrid warfare, the Council could decide to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as in the case of an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO and Allies will continue to prepare for, deter, and defend against\u00c2\u00a0hybrid threats.\u00c2\u00a0 Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing our situational awareness and expanding the tools at our disposal to\u00c2\u00a0counter hybrid threats,\u00c2\u00a0including disinformation campaigns,\u00c2\u00a0by developing comprehensive preventive and response options.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges.\n32.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance\u00c2\u00a0are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent.\u00c2\u00a0 This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm.\u00c2\u00a0 To face this evolving challenge, we have today endorsed NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which will support NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture, and further enhance our resilience.\u00c2\u00a0 Reaffirming NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.\u00c2\u00a0 We will promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict by supporting international law and voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We will make greater use of NATO as a platform for political consultation among Allies, sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses.\u00c2\u00a0 If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us.\u00c2\u00a0 Our response need not be restricted to the cyber domain.\u00c2\u00a0 We will enhance our situational awareness to support NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision-making.\u00c2\u00a0 Resilience and the ability to detect, prevent, mitigate, and respond to vulnerabilities and intrusions is critical, as demonstrated by malicious cyber actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exploitation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO as an organisation will therefore continue to adapt and improve its cyber defences.\u00c2\u00a0 Five years since the adoption of our Cyber Defence Pledge, we remain committed to uphold strong national cyber defences as a matter of priority.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to implement cyberspace as a domain of operations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We will\u00c2\u00a0enhance the effective integration of\u00c2\u00a0sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into\u00c2\u00a0collective defence and Alliance operations and missions, in the framework of strong political oversight.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent opening of the NATO Communications and Information Academy in Portugal.\n33.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise the growing importance of space for the security and prosperity of our nations and for NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence.\u00c2\u00a0 Secure access to space services, products, and capabilities is essential for the conduct of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, missions and activities.\u00c2\u00a0 We will accelerate our work to deepen and expand our use of space as an operational domain, including through the NATO Space Centre in Germany and the upcoming establishment of the Space Centre of Excellence in France, which we welcome.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s space domain awareness and better integrate space in our activities, including training and exercises, resilience, and innovation efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 Consistent with the Overarching Space Policy, NATO's approach to space will remain fully in line with international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the international efforts to promote responsible behaviour in space.\u00c2\u00a0 We consider that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance, the impact of which could threaten national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability, and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.\u00c2\u00a0 Such attacks could lead to the invocation of Article 5.\u00c2\u00a0 A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\n34.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to stand and act together in response to the challenging security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 As it continues to evolve, the Alliance will continue to respond and adapt as necessary.\u00c2\u00a0 Since the Warsaw Summit, we have established a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to improve our enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland through alignment with plans and by ensuring the ability of the four combat-ready battlegroups to operate with national home defence forces in an integrated manner.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored Forward Presence on land, at sea, and in the air in the Black Sea region, and we remain committed to its full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Our assurance measures, including exercises and various other air, land, and maritime activities, remain in place and continue to provide the fundamental baseline requirement for assurance and deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored assurance measures for Turkey, and we remain committed to their full implementation.\u00c2\u00a0 We have a range of forces, including the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which are ready to deploy on short notice to respond to any contingencies and reinforce Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The full implementation of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Framework for the South, as an enduring component of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture, is ongoing.\u00c2\u00a0 Building on the progress achieved since 2016, including the establishment of the Hub for the South, we will continue to strengthen our capacity to deal with the threats and challenges emanating from the South, including in the Mediterranean Sea region and its approaches, by enhancing our strategic awareness, our plans, and the readiness of our forces.\u00c2\u00a0 In the High North, we will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities in support of the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security interests.\u00c2\u00a0 We will seek to strengthen cooperation with relevant and like-minded partners in the interests of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreed deterrence and defence objectives, in line with NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions, policies and procedures, as appropriate, and with consideration of political implications.\n35.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all aspects of the Defence Investment Pledge agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Fair burden sharing underpins the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cohesion, solidarity, credibility, and ability to fulfil our fundamental Article 3 and Article 5 commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We are, individually and collectively, committed to further improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of Alliance membership. \u00c2\u00a0We have made considerable progress since the Wales Summit with seven consecutive years of real growth in non-US defence expenditure, which reinforces our shared responsibility to provide capabilities to the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 All Allies have increased the amount they spend on defence in real terms and this trend is set to continue.\u00c2\u00a0 Since 2014, European Allies and Canada will have added 260 billion US dollars by the end of this year.\u00c2\u00a0 Furthermore, ten Allies are expected to spend 2% or more of GDP on defence this year.\u00c2\u00a0 About two-thirds of Allies plan to reach or exceed the 2% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally, 24 Allies are spending more than 20% of their defence expenditures on major equipment, including related research and development, and, according to their national plans, 27 Allies will meet the 20% guideline by 2024.\u00c2\u00a0 Our overall security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend it.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies continue to make valuable force and capability contributions that benefit the security of the Euro-Atlantic area through NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, missions, and other activities, as well as through the operations and missions conducted under national authority and the authority of other organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies invest considerable resources in preparing their forces, capabilities, and infrastructure for Alliance activities and Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operations.\u00c2\u00a0 In the years ahead, in line with the Defence Investment Pledge and building on the good progress to date, we affirm our commitment to continue our efforts as a matter of priority across the three pillars of cash, capabilities, and contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 We must and will do more.\n36.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are investing in our military capabilities in order to meet new and enduring challenges across all operational domains.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to deliver an array of robust and sophisticated capabilities across all domains, including heavier, more high-end, technologically advanced, better-supported forces and capabilities at the required readiness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve and adapt the sustainability, deployability, and interoperability of our capabilities for a demanding strategic environment, as well as high-end operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Our national capability development plans will support the full and timely implementation of the capabilities, in particular those required by the Alliance in line with the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00c2\u00a0 In light of the pace, breadth, and scale of technological developments, as we further develop our forces and capabilities, we recognise the vital importance of research and development and innovation to exploit the opportunities and to address the challenges posed by emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 This will help to ensure, individually and collectively, our technological edge now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue working to address, as appropriate, existing dependencies on Russian-sourced legacy military equipment through national efforts and multinational cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the modernisation of the NATO AWACS fleet and the progress of the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control programme, as well as the initial operations of the new Alliance Ground Surveillance Force.\u00c2\u00a0 Through NATO-supported multinational cooperation projects, Allies are committed to working together to develop or acquire new capabilities in key areas such as air-to-air refuelling, training, precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.\n37.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The speed of technological change has never been higher, creating both new opportunities and risks\u00c2\u00a0in the security environment and to the way NATO operates.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve our technological edge, and ensure Alliance interoperability, in order to maintain the credibility of our deterrence and defence posture.\u00c2\u00a0 We have recently taken important steps to that end, building on the Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) Roadmap we agreed in 2019, and have now adopted our strategy to foster and protect EDTs.\u00c2\u00a0 This strategy outlines a clear approach for identifying, developing, and adopting EDTs at the speed of relevance, guided by principles of responsible use, in accordance with\u00c2\u00a0international law,\u00c2\u00a0and taking into account discussions in relevant international fora.\u00c2\u00a0 Moreover, this strategy seeks to\u00c2\u00a0preserve our interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments by others, both now and in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Drawing on the extensive innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to maintain our technological edge.\n38.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territory and our populations against attack, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. \u00c2\u00a0No one should doubt NATO's resolve if the security of any of its members were to be threatened.\u00c2\u00a0 Faced with a highly diverse, complex, and demanding international security environment, NATO is determined to maintain the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our populations, wherever it should arise.\n39.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Credible deterrence and defence is essential as a means to prevent conflict and war and will continue to be based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 A robust deterrence and defence posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides an essential political and military transatlantic link, through an equitable and sustainable distribution of roles, responsibilities, and burdens.\u00c2\u00a0 We acknowledge the increasingly challenging security environment with risks arising from changes in the posture, doctrine, and behaviour of potential adversaries and their significant investments to develop, modernise, and expand capabilities.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO continues to adapt and remains steadfast in its resolve to take all necessary steps to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture remains credible, coherent, resilient, and adaptable to the security environment.\n40.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goal is to continue to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defence and to contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 In response to the more challenging security environment, NATO has taken steps to ensure its nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure, and effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 These Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned.\u00c2\u00a0 National contributions of dual-capable aircraft to NATO's nuclear deterrence mission remain central to this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in the agreed nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies concerned will continue to drive forward progress on sustaining leadership focus and institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will also continue to ensure greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deterrence and defence posture, strengthen effective strategic communications and enhance the effectiveness of NATO exercises to maintain and demonstrate a credible deterrence and reduce strategic risk.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO supports efforts towards strategic risk reduction which constitute important contributions to regional and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 In particular, transparency and dialogue can help avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.\n41.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.\u00c2\u00a0 Given the deteriorating security environment in Europe, a credible and united nuclear Alliance is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 Nuclear weapons are unique.\u00c2\u00a0 The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO reiterates that any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.\u00c2\u00a0 If the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened, however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve.\n42.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to continue to deliver a NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability, to pursue the Alliance's core task of collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is purely defensive.\u00c2\u00a0 The aim and political principles of NATO BMD remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 These principles are the indivisibility of Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security and NATO solidarity, equitable sharing of risks and burdens as well as reasonable challenge, taking into account the level of threat, affordability, and technical feasibility, and in accordance with the latest common threat assessments agreed by the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Should international efforts reduce the threats posed by ballistic missile proliferation, NATO missile defence can and will adapt accordingly.\n43.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Turkey, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.\u00c2\u00a0 Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability.\u00c2\u00a0 Full Allied political control and oversight are essential, and full implementation will be ensured and monitored.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with third states on a case-by-case basis to enhance transparency, build mutual confidence, and increase ballistic missile defence effectiveness.\n44.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is not directed against Russia and will not undermine Russia's strategic deterrence.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO BMD is intended to defend against potential threats emanating from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We have explained to Russia many times that the BMD system is not capable against Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent and there is no intention to redesign this system to have such a capability in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Hence, Russian statements threatening to target Allies because of NATO BMD are unacceptable and counterproductive.\u00c2\u00a0 Should Russia be ready to discuss BMD with NATO, and subject to Alliance agreement, NATO remains open to the discussion.\n45.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.\u00c2\u00a0 After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 We regret that the conditions for achieving disarmament have not been realised since the 2018 Brussels NATO Summit.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We welcome and fully support the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty for five years.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies believe the New START Treaty contributes to international stability, and Allies again express their strong support for its continued implementation and for early and active dialogue on ways to improve strategic stability.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will welcome new strategic talks between the United States and Russia on future arms control measures, taking into account all Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will support further arms control negotiations, with the aim of improving the security of the Alliance, taking into account the prevailing international security environment.\n46.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains clear-eyed about the challenges Russia poses, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance will be guided by experience, not least Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s material breach of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which ultimately led to the termination of that agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to respond in a measured and responsible way to the significant risks posed by the Russian 9M729 missile, and other short- and intermediate-range missiles, to Allied security.\u00c2\u00a0 We have agreed a balanced, coordinated, and defensive package of measures to ensure NATO's deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective, including through potential arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal for a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe is inconsistent with Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unilateral and ongoing deployment of such systems on the continent and would not prevent Russia from building up such missiles outside of its European territory; this proposal is therefore not credible and not acceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 At the same time, NATO Allies remain open to meaningful arms control discussions and dialogue on reciprocal transparency and confidence-building measures that would take into account security interests of all Allies and increase security across the Alliance.\n47.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons, the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT in all its aspects, as an irreplaceable platform, and the strengthening of the NPT across its mutually reinforcing three pillars.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to working towards a meaningful outcome at the upcoming Tenth Review Conference, which presents a major opportunity to contribute to the preservation, universalisation, and full implementation of the NPT.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms its resolve to seek a safer world for all and to take further practical steps and effective measures to create the conditions for further nuclear disarmament negotiations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, including Article VI, in an ever more effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO's nuclear arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT, which remains the only credible path to nuclear disarmament.\u00c2\u00a0 The enduring success of the NPT cannot be taken for granted and requires sustained effort to further its achievements.\u00c2\u00a0 In this spirit, we call on all NPT States Parties to work together towards a successful Tenth Review Conference.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which is inconsistent with the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.\u00c2\u00a0 The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament.\n48.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 While NATO is not itself party to any arms control agreement, Allies will make best use of NATO as an important platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts that will support Alliance unity, political cohesion, and solidarity.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue actively to address the collapse of the INF Treaty due to Russian actions, and we are committed to maintain appropriate consultations among Allies on these issues.\n49.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain deeply concerned by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), as well as their means of delivery and related materials, by states and non-state actors, which represents a growing threat to our populations, territory, and forces.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as use in Iraq, Russia, Malaysia, and, for the first time since NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundation on Allied territory, the United Kingdom.\u00c2\u00a0 The use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, for any reason is unacceptable.\u00c2\u00a0 There can be no impunity for those who use chemical weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We therefore welcome, as an important step towards accountability, the decision by the April 2021 Conference of the State Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to suspend Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and privileges under the CWC.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to uphold the CWC and the global norm against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and to hold those who use chemical weapons accountable for their actions, including through our joint commitment within the International Partnership Against the Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the full implementation of the CWC and the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in addressing WMD threats and condemn those who seek to impede its work.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains committed to ensuring that Allies can protect their populations, forces, and territories against CBRN threats, including through reviewing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comprehensive, Strategic Level Policy for Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Defending against CBRN Threats.\u00c2\u00a0 We are united in our resolve to promote the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline the need to bring the treaty into force and we support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\u00c2\u00a0Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission, including the International Data Centre and International Monitoring System.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.\u00c2\u00a0 In the meantime, the Alliance calls on all states to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n50.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We remain committed to conventional arms control as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are determined to preserve, strengthen, and modernise conventional arms control in Europe, based on key principles and commitments, including reciprocity, transparency, and host nation consent.\u00c2\u00a0 Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing aggressive military posture, its refusal to fully comply with its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, its ongoing selective implementation of the Vienna Document, and its long-standing failure to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, continue to undermine security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies call on Russia to return to full implementation of, and compliance with the letter and spirit of all of its international obligations and commitments, which is essential to rebuilding trust and confidence, military transparency and increasing predictability in the Euro-Atlantic region.\u00c2\u00a0 We specifically call on Russia to be open and transparent about its no-notice snap exercises, large-scale exercises and large-scale troop movements, in accordance with its Vienna Document commitments, particularly in light of its recent unprovoked and unjustified military build-up in and around Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies underscore the importance of modernising the Vienna Document, and welcome the broad support for its comprehensive modernisation package.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to intensified discussions in the Forum for Security Cooperation leading to consensus on an updated Vienna Document at the 2021 OSCE Ministerial.\u00c2\u00a0 To maintain the contributions of the Treaty on Open Skies to the security of all State Parties, it is essential that all State Parties fully implement its provisions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to actively support ongoing discussions at the OSCE, including the Structured Dialogue.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Russia to engage constructively on all these efforts.\n51.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full support to the goal of the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea, in accordance with relevant UNSCRs.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on the Democratic People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to engage in meaningful negotiations with the United States towards achieving this goal.\u00c2\u00a0 We urge the DPRK to fully implement its international obligations; to eliminate its nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capabilities and ballistic missiles; to return to the NPT and its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and to abandon all related programmes.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on nations to fully implement existing UN sanctions.\n52.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We are committed to ensuring that Iran will never develop a nuclear weapon.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the substantive discussions between Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) participants, and separately with the United States, to accomplish a mutual return to compliance with the JCPoA by the United States and Iran.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the goal of restoring the non-proliferation benefits of the JCPoA and of ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nuclear programme.\u00c2\u00a0 It is vital that Iran preserves the space for these discussions by avoiding any further escalation.\u00c2\u00a0 We strongly support the IAEA in its crucial monitoring and verification work to help ensure Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compliance with the NPT-related safeguards obligations, as well as its other commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 A restored and fully implemented JCPoA could also pave the way to further address regional and security concerns, including in support of the non-proliferation regime.\u00c2\u00a0 We condemn Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, including through financing, training, and the proliferation of missile technology and weapons.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231, refrain from destabilising actions, and play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace.\nSyria retains an inventory of short-range ballistic missiles whose range covers parts of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory and some of our partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 territories.\u00c2\u00a0 Syria has used these missiles extensively against its own population.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain vigilant over missile launches from Syria which could again hit or target Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We continue to monitor and assess the ballistic missile threat from Syria.\nThe increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the vicinity of the south-eastern border of the Alliance has been, and remains a driver in NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development and deployment of a ballistic missile defence system, which is configured to counter threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\n53.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The conflict in Syria has entered its eleventh year and continues to have significant consequences on the stability of the region and the security of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s south-eastern border.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned and vigilant over its ramifications.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our determination to defend NATO territory and borders against any threats and to address challenges emanating from Syria.\u00c2\u00a0 The presidential elections held on 26 May 2021 by the Syrian regime cannot be considered as free and fair and do not contribute to the efforts to achieve a political solution.\u00c2\u00a0 We underline that stability and security cannot be reinstated in Syria without a genuine political process in line with UNSCR 2254.\u00c2\u00a0 We call for a nationwide ceasefire and the reauthorisation and expansion of the UN cross-border humanitarian assistance for a period of at least 12\u00c2\u00a0months in order to meet the needs of the Syrian people.\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate our appreciation to our Ally Turkey for hosting millions of Syrian refugees.\n54.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies remain deeply concerned about developments in Belarus since August 2020.\u00c2\u00a0 The policies and actions of Belarus have implications for regional stability and have violated the principles which underpin our partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will remain vigilant\u00c2\u00a0of and monitor the implications for the security of the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 The\u00c2\u00a0unacceptable diversion of a civilian aircraft in May 2021 and the subsequent arrest of a journalist and his partner travelling on board endangered the safety of civilians and was a grave affront to political dissent and freedom of the press.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the independent investigations, including by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\u00c2\u00a0 We support measures taken by Allies individually and collectively in response to this incident.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on Belarus to abide by international law, respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including those belonging to the Union of Poles in Belarus.\u00c2\u00a0 A democratic, sovereign, and stable Belarus is in all of our interests.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies stand ready for a mutually beneficial NATO-Belarus partnership, taking into account political and security conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 We will follow the scale, scope, and aftermath of the Zapad-2021 exercise, and continue to call on Russia and Belarus to act in a predictable, transparent way in compliance with their international obligations and OSCE commitments.\n55.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\u00c2\u00a0 We are concerned by those coercive policies which stand in contrast to the fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty.\u00c2\u00a0 China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad.\u00c2\u00a0 It is opaque in implementing its military modernisation and its publicly declared military-civil fusion strategy.\u00c2\u00a0 It is also cooperating militarily with Russia, including through participation in Russian exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain concerned with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on China to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains, in keeping with its role as a major power.\n56.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO maintains a constructive dialogue with China where possible.\u00c2\u00a0 Based on our interests, we welcome opportunities to engage with China on areas of relevance to the Alliance and on common challenges such as climate change.\u00c2\u00a0 There is value in information exchange on respective policies and activities, to enhance awareness and discuss potential disagreements.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge China to engage meaningfully in dialogue, confidence-building, and transparency measures regarding its nuclear capabilities and doctrine.\u00c2\u00a0 Reciprocal transparency and understanding would benefit both NATO and China.\n57.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are working together as an Alliance and with like-minded partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect critical infrastructure, strengthen resilience, maintain our technological edge, and address these challenges to the rules-based international order.\n58.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times.\u00c2\u00a0 It is a threat multiplier that impacts Allied security, both in the Euro-Atlantic area and in the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader neighbourhood.\u00c2\u00a0 Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations.\u00c2\u00a0 Today we have endorsed an Action Plan to implement our NATO Agenda on Climate Change and Security, which increases our awareness, adaptation, mitigation, and outreach efforts, while ensuring a credible deterrence and defence posture and upholding the priorities of the safety of military personnel and operational and cost effectiveness.\u00c2\u00a0 To increase awareness, NATO will conduct annual assessments of the impact of climate change on its strategic environment as well as on missions and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 To adapt to climate change, NATO will incorporate climate change considerations into its full spectrum of work, ranging from defence planning and capability development to civil preparedness and exercises.\u00c2\u00a0 To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, drawing on best practices of Allies, and taking into account their different national circumstances, NATO will develop a mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations, which\u00c2\u00a0could contribute to formulating voluntary goals to reduce such emissions.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will also strengthen exchanges with partner countries as well as with international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security issues.\n59.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Energy security plays an important role in our common security.\u00c2\u00a0 A stable and reliable energy supply, the diversification of routes, suppliers, and energy resources, including the integration of sustainable energy sources, and the interconnectivity of energy networks, are all of critical importance and increase our resilience against political and economic pressure.\u00c2\u00a0 It is essential to ensure that the members of the Alliance are not vulnerable to political or coercive manipulation of energy, which constitutes a potential threat.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies will therefore continue to seek further\u00c2\u00a0diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions.\u00c2\u00a0 While these issues are primarily the responsibility of national authorities, energy developments can have significant political and security implications for Allies and also affect our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Consequently, we will continue to enhance our strategic awareness, including through regular Allied consultations and intelligence sharing, and will strengthen our links with relevant international organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 We will further develop NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical infrastructure, including against malicious hybrid and cyber activity.\u00c2\u00a0 We will ensure reliable energy supplies to our military forces.\n60.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO has long recognised the importance of Human Security, which focuses on risks and threats to populations in conflict or crisis areas and how to mitigate and respond to them.\u00c2\u00a0 Taking a Human Security approach is a reflection of our values and makes us more operationally effective.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that all efforts are made to avoid, minimise, and mitigate any potential negative effects on civilians arising from our missions or activities, as underscored in our Policy for the Protection of Civilians.\u00c2\u00a0 Today,\u00c2\u00a0we endorse\u00c2\u00a0NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Policy on Preventing and Responding to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, a landmark demonstration of our commitment to addressing such violence, which inflicts long-term stigma\u00c2\u00a0and trauma on individuals and families, contributes to their marginalisation, destroys the social fabric of communities, triggers displacement, fuels armed actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 activities, fosters prolonged conflict and instability, and is an impediment to sustainable peace and reconciliation.\u00c2\u00a0 We are updating our policy on combating trafficking in human beings.\u00c2\u00a0 Our ongoing work on Human Security also includes Children and Armed Conflict and Cultural Property Protection.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will continue to work with its partners, international organisations, and civil society to further our Human Security agenda, which includes robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in support of lasting peace and security and our populations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 common defence.\n61.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising the critical importance of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, as well as the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including conflict-related sexual violence, we are committed to fully implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Policy and Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security better prepare the Alliance to address the challenges of today and tomorrow.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Policy on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, agreed in 2019, reinforces our commitment to hold ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour, in keeping with our values.\u00c2\u00a0 Working together with partners, international organisations, and civil society, we will consistently continue to implement our policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, and activities.\n62.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Building Integrity Policy and Programme.\u00c2\u00a0 Corruption and poor governance undermine democracy, the rule of law, and economic development, thus constituting challenges to our security.\u00c2\u00a0 Implementing measures to improve integrity building, to fight against corruption, and to foster good governance is of continued importance for NATO, Allies, and partners alike.\n63.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnerships is demonstrated by their strategic contribution to Alliance and international security.\u00c2\u00a0 They play an important role in supporting NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.\u00c2\u00a0 They are central to advancing NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperative security agenda, helping to shape our security environment, and contributing to stability in the Euro-Atlantic area, and to the pursuit of NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political and military objectives.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent, and more effective.\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner relationships are also\u00c2\u00a0based on reciprocity, mutual benefit and mutual respect.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.\u00c2\u00a0 We recognise their sacrifices for Euro-Atlantic and international security over the years.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to improve interoperability, in particular with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners.\u00c2\u00a0 Recognising that conflict and instability in NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbourhood directly undermine Allied security, we will continue to intensify NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance and capacity building support to our partners.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to expand political dialogue and practical cooperation with any nation that shares the Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values and interest in international peace and security and will further develop our partnerships so that they continue to meet the interests of both Allies and partners.\u00c2\u00a0 In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO's own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations.\n64.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 The NATO-EU strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence.\u00c2\u00a0 The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.\u00c2\u00a0 Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.\u00c2\u00a0 Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU's efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fullest involvement in these efforts is essential.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to further strengthen our strategic partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations.\n65.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO-EU cooperation has reached unprecedented levels, with tangible results in countering hybrid and cyber threats, strategic communication, operational cooperation including maritime issues, military mobility, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, exercises, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance this cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to develop and deepen our cooperation by fully implementing the common set of 74 proposals, which contribute to the coherence and complementarity of our efforts.\u00c2\u00a0 The current strategic environment and the COVID pandemic underscore the importance of NATO-EU cooperation in the face of current and evolving security challenges, in particular in addressing resilience issues, emerging and disruptive technologies, the security implications of climate change, disinformation, and the growing geostrategic competition.\u00c2\u00a0 The ongoing distinct strategic processes within NATO and the EU offer a unique opportunity to intensify further our consultations and cooperation to enhance the security of our citizens and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond, while reaffirming that NATO remains the transatlantic framework for strong collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the Secretary General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued close cooperation with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the High Representative, on all aspects of the NATO-EU strategic partnership.\n66.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, which has been a historic success.\u00c2\u00a0 North Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accession last year is yet another tangible demonstration of this commitment.\u00c2\u00a0 Successive rounds of enlargement have strengthened Euro-Atlantic security by helping to spread and consolidate the rule of law and democratic institutions and practices across the European continent, and have respected the right of all states to seek their own security arrangements, as enshrined in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door remains open to all European democracies which share the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, which are in a position to further the principles of the Treaty, and whose inclusion can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\u00c2\u00a0 Decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself; no third party has a say in that process.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0We remain committed to the integration of those countries that aspire to join the Alliance, judging each on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage them to continue to implement the necessary reforms and decisions to prepare for membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to offer support to their efforts and look to them to take the steps necessary to advance their aspirations.\n67.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Allies strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements, encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to avoid divisive rhetoric.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aspirant country, for its contributions to NATO-led operations.\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to maintaining strong political dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and offer our continued support to the implementation of all reform efforts, including through NATO HQ Sarajevo.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take full advantage of the breadth of NATO cooperative security and partnership tools.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies welcome the work of the Commission for Cooperation with NATO.\u00c2\u00a0 Allies urge political leaders to work constructively and to demonstrate political will for the benefit of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina in advancing Euro-Atlantic aspirations by implementing the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, including through the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reform Programme with NATO, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership.\n68.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 As an Enhanced Opportunities Partner, Georgia is cooperating closely with the Alliance across a wide range of issues.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly appreciate Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the recent political agreement on the Way Ahead for Georgia and encourage its full implementation by all sides.\u00c2\u00a0 This agreement paves the way for the important reforms which will help Georgia, an aspirant country, progress in its preparations towards membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme in deepening political dialogue and cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the significant progress on reforms which Georgia has made and must continue to make, and which have helped Georgia strengthen its defence capabilities and interoperability with the Alliance.\u00c2\u00a0 Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the Alliance contains all the practical tools to prepare for eventual membership.\u00c2\u00a0 We are working closely with Georgia on security in the Black Sea region, in response to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly destabilising activities, and welcome the steps taken to implement the refreshed Substantial NATO-Georgia Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand ready to enhance our support to Georgia, including in building resilience against hybrid threats, in training and exercises, and in secure communications.\u00c2\u00a0 We look forward to the next NATO-Georgia exercise in 2022.\n69.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00c2\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00c2\u00a0 The Annual National Programmes under the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) remain the mechanism by which Ukraine takes forward the reforms pertaining to its aspiration for NATO membership.\u00c2\u00a0 Ukraine should make full use of all instruments available under the NUC to reach its objective of implementing NATO principles and standards.\u00c2\u00a0 The success of wide-ranging, sustainable, and irreversible reforms, including combating corruption, promoting an inclusive political process, and decentralisation reform, based on democratic values, respect for human rights, minorities, and the rule of law, will be crucial in laying the groundwork for a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine.\u00c2\u00a0 Further reforms in the security sector, including the reform of the Security Services of Ukraine, are particularly important.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome significant reforms already made by Ukraine and strongly encourage further progress in line with Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international obligations and commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to provide practical support to reform in the security and defence sector, including through the Comprehensive Assistance Package.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to support Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to strengthen its resilience against hybrid threats, including through intensifying activities under the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the cooperation between NATO and Ukraine with regard to security in the Black Sea region.\u00c2\u00a0 The Enhanced Opportunities Partner status granted last year provides further impetus to our already ambitious cooperation and will promote greater interoperability, with the option of more joint exercises, training, and enhanced situational awareness.\u00c2\u00a0 Military cooperation and capacity building initiatives between Allies and Ukraine,\u00c2\u00a0including the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, further reinforce this effort.\u00c2\u00a0 We highly value Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant contributions to Allied operations, the NATO Response Force, and NATO exercises.\n70.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO, as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO remains strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans and to supporting the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the countries in the region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will intensify our efforts in the region and enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reform efforts, promote regional peace and security, and counter the malign influence of outside actors.\u00c2\u00a0 Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.\u00c2\u00a0 We value the NATO-Serbia partnership.\u00c2\u00a0 Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.\u00c2\u00a0 We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.\n71.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) which contributes to a safe and secure environment and to wider stability in the Western Balkans, and through ongoing capacity building efforts with the Kosovo security organisations.\u00c2\u00a0 Any changes to our force posture in KFOR remain conditions-based and not calendar-driven.\n72.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close and mutually beneficial security cooperation with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners Finland and Sweden, which share our values and contribute to NATO-led operations and missions, has grown across a wide range of areas.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen our ability to respond rapidly and effectively to any common challenges and to work together on enhancing our resilience and civil preparedness.\u00c2\u00a0 We will bolster our regular and open political dialogue and cooperation in support of our common security, including by crisis management preparation, exercises, and exchanging information and analysis, notably on the security situation in the Baltic Sea region.\n73.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We will work more closely with all our Western European partners to share expertise, address emerging security challenges, and continue our cooperation on operations, missions, and other initiatives.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also seek to further develop relations with our partners\u00c2\u00a0across the globe.\u00c2\u00a0 We are enhancing political dialogue and practical cooperation with our long-standing Asia-Pacific partners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to promote cooperative security and support the rules-based international order.\u00c2\u00a0 We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared concerns.\u00c2\u00a0 We are intensifying our interaction with Colombia, NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partner in Latin America, on good governance, military training, interoperability, demining, and maritime security.\u00c2\u00a0 We remain open to deepening our political dialogue and intensifying our practical cooperation with our partners in Central Asia, taking into account the regional situation.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the interest of other global actors to work with NATO in addressing our shared security concerns and stand ready to explore further engagement on a case-by-case basis.\n74.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 We are committed to enhancing our long-standing engagement in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.\u00c2\u00a0 We will strengthen our political dialogue and practical cooperation with our Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) partners.\u00c2\u00a0 This will build stronger security and defence institutions and capacities, promote interoperability, and help to counter terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 We have upgraded our defence capacity building assistance to Jordan, our Enhanced Opportunities Partner, to include additional counter-terrorism support, and have contributed to the establishment of the new Military Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Training Centre.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue our engagement with Tunisia on defence capacity building.\u00c2\u00a0 We will leverage the NATO-ICI Regional Centre in Kuwait as an important hub for education, training, and public diplomacy activities, and we remain open to the potential establishment of other education and training centres with interested MENA countries.\u00c2\u00a0 Our Regional Hub for the South, in Naples, is making tangible progress in implementing its four functions and contributing to our situational awareness and understanding.\u00c2\u00a0 We will continue to engage with the African Union and further develop our relations with the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council in order to enhance our ability\u00c2\u00a0to better\u00c2\u00a0address mutual security concerns.\n75.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The deteriorating situation in the Sahel region matters to NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collective security.\u00c2\u00a0 This\u00c2\u00a0region is a theatre of complex and interconnected challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to the Sahel is currently focused on our long-standing partnership with Mauritania, and we are looking into providing additional advice and training support.\u00c2\u00a0 We will also continue to engage in dialogue with relevant NATO partners, representatives from the Sahel region, international and regional organisations and entities such as the African Union, the G5 Sahel structures, the UN, and the EU, as well as with the Coalition for the Sahel.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO will enhance its engagement with the G5 Sahel structures and remains open, upon request, to consider further engagements in the region.\n76.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 The crisis in Libya has direct implications for regional stability and the security of all Allies.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome the progress achieved in Libya, including the recent endorsement of the interim Government of National Unity (GNU) and Presidency Council.\u00c2\u00a0 We commend the UN efforts in support of a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, aimed at promoting national reconciliation as well as unifying and strengthening state institutions.\u00c2\u00a0 We call on all the relevant Libyan authorities and institutions, including the GNU and the House of Representatives, to take actions set out in the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum roadmap and to make the necessary preparations for free, fair, and inclusive national Presidential and Parliamentary elections on 24\u00c2\u00a0December\u00c2\u00a02021.\u00c2\u00a0 We fully\u00c2\u00a0support the implementation of UNSCRs 2570 and 2571 and the 23 October 2020 ceasefire agreement.\u00c2\u00a0 In accordance with our Summit decisions, we remain committed to providing advice to Libya, upon its request, in the area of defence and security institution building, taking into account political and security conditions.\n77.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is an Alliance that constantly modernises and adapts to new threats and challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 NATO is also adapting as an institution.\u00c2\u00a0 To enhance our political-military coherence and situational awareness, we have restructured the activities of the NATO Headquarters, and established a Chief Information Officer function.\u00c2\u00a0 We welcome and will continue progress towards an optimised NATO intelligence enterprise, better postured to provide

In spite of this, epidemiological data on vulnerable groups such as Indigenous people are scarce, making it difficult to implement public policies in order to prevent this disease and assist these populations.\nTo describe the serological and epidemiological profile of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in two Indigenous populations in Northeast Brazil, as well as in an urbanized control community, and to explore associations between CHIKV and anthropometric variables in these populations.\nThis is a cross-sectional ancillary study of the Project of Atherosclerosis among Indigenous Populations (PAI) that included people 30 to 70 years old, recruited from two Indigenous tribes (the less urbanized Fulni-\u00f4 and the more urbanized Truk\u00e1 people) and an urbanized non-Indigenous control group from the same area. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation and were tested for anti-CHIKV IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serological profile was described according to ethnicity, sex, and age. The study population included 433 individuals distributed as follows: 109 (25\u00b72%) Truk\u00e1, 272 (62\u00b78%) Fulni-\u00f4, and 52 (12%) from the non-Indigenous urbanized control group. Overall prevalence of CHIKV IgG in the study sample was 49.9% (216; 95% CI: 45\u00b71\u201354\u00b77). When the sample was stratified, positive CHIKV IgG was distributed as follows: no individuals in the Truk\u00e1 group, 78\u00b73% (213/272; 95% CI: 72\u00b79\u201383\u00b71) in the Fulni-\u00f4 group, and 5.8% (3/52; 95% CI: 1.21\u201316) in the control group.\nPositive tests for CHIKV showed a very high prevalence in a traditional Indigenous population, in contrast to the absence of anti-CHIKV serology in the Truk\u00e1 people, who are more urbanized with respect to physical landscape, socio-cultural, and historical aspects, as well as a low prevalence in the non-Indigenous control group, although all groups are located in the same area.\nChikungunya fever is a serious public health problem, with a high rate of infection and disease. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a cosmopolitan virus, which has inflicted severe damage in 50 countries in the Americas and is responsible for chronic disabling manifestations. In spite of this, epidemiological data on vulnerable groups such as Indigenous people are scarce. We report on a cross-sectional study describing the seroprevalence of CHIKV in Indigenous groups in the S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Brazil, in association with anthropometric data. The study population included 433 individuals distributed in the following ethnic groups: 109 (25.2%) Truk\u00e1, 272 (62\u00b78%) Fulni-\u00f4, and 52 (12%) from the non-Indigenous urbanized control group When the sample was stratified, positive CHIKV IgG was distributed as follows: no individuals in the Truk\u00e1 group, 213/272 (78.3%; 95% CI: 72\u00b79\u201383\u00b71) individuals in the Fulni-\u00f4 group, and 3/52 (5.8%; 95% CI: 1\u00b721\u201316) individuals in the control group. This study shows, for the first time, that CHIKV circulated in an Indigenous population (Fulni-\u00f4) in the S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, in 2016 and 2017. The finding strikingly differs from the absence of anti-CHIKV serology found in the Truk\u00e1 people and from the low prevalence in the urban region of Juazeiro, Bahia.\nEditor: Brett M.

Among these, chikungunya fever (CHIKF) stands out, in the early 2000s with rapid spread, reaching global proportions [1]. Despite this, little is known about the behavior of this arbovirosis in restricted access groups, considering the ethnic characteristics of each population.\nCHIKF, which is caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), was silent for three decades until major outbreaks affected people in Kenya and India in 2004 and 2005, respectively [2,3]. In 2013, the disease reached the Americas, and it affected approximately 50 countries by the end of 2014, with almost 23,000 confirmed autochthonous cases [4,5]. In 2014, the disease officially arrived in Brazil, and the first autochthonous cases were registered, almost simultaneously in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian Northeast (the poorest region in the country) and in the Amazon Forest Region [6]. Within about two years, nearly one million cases of CHIKF had been registered in the Americas, Aedes aegypti being the main vector [7,8]. However, the impact of CHIKV on Brazilian Indigenous populations is still unknown.\nIn Brazil, there are officially 760,350 Indigenous people, composing 416 ethnic groups and 6,238 villages, who receive health care assistance from 1,199 Indigenous Primary Health Units [9]. Indigenous groups are distributed throughout the vast territory of Brazil, living in various stages of urbanization. The Northeast Region of Brazil, where European colonization began, is home to Indigenous peoples with diverse ethnicities and traditions [10]. However, very few studies have evaluated the impact of new epidemics on Indigenous communities [11].\nTo date, in Brazil, the largest records of probable case reports of CHIKF were published in the years 2016 and 2017, with 277,882 and 185,605 cases, respectively, and more than 151,000 confirmed cases during these years. The states in the Northeast Region had the highest incidence rates in 2016 and 2017 (420\u00b73 cases/100,000 inhabitants and 249\u00b75 cases/100,000 inhabitants, respectively) [12]. In 2018, the Northeast Region showed a significant drop in notifications, becoming fourth out of five regions in terms of incidence (19\u00b75 cases/100,000 inhabitants) [13]. In 2020, up to epidemiological week (EW) 46, the Northeast registered an incidence of 37\u00b75 cases/100,000 inhabitants, showing an increase in cases compared to the previous year [14].\nCurrently, the Northeast state of Pernambuco, which registered new CHIKV case rates of 531\u00b74 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2016, has an incidence of 34 cases/100,000 inhabitants by EW 38 of 2020 [12,14]. These notifications, however, did not take the country\u2019s vulnerable Indigenous populations into consideration.\nSeroprevalence studies on arbovirosis in Indigenous groups in the Americas are rare. In 2004, one study identified the seroprevalence of dengue IgG in the Yukpa and Bar\u00ed Indigenous tribes in Venezuela [15]. Later, in 2015, a seroprevalence study of CHIKV, hantavirus, and rickettsia was conducted in the Tuch\u00edn Indigenous community in Northern Colombia, finding no cases of CHIKV in the study population [16].\nThis study describes the serological and epidemiological profile of CHIKV in two Indigenous populations in the Northeast Region of Brazil, at different stages of urbanization, in addition to an urbanized control community in the same region. Our hypothesis was that the groups with lower degrees of urbanization, socio-cultural confinement behavior, and conditions strongly related to worse sanitation and health education would have the highest prevalence of CHIKV. Furthermore, this study explores the associations between the serological profile of CHIKV and anthropometric variables usually related to worse outcomes in arbovirosis outbreaks [17].\nThe research was approved by the National Research Ethics Council (CONEP number 1.488.268), the National Indigenous Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio [FUNAI]; process number 08620.028965/2015-66), and the Indigenous leaders of the participating groups. All participants provided written informed consent before taking part in the study [18,19].\nThis is a descriptive, cross-sectional, seroprevalence study, with stratified sample according to the degree of urbanization, carried out in specific populations of the S\u00e3o Francisco Valley in Northeast Brazil, composed of Indigenous groups from two tribes (Fulni-\u00f4 and Truk\u00e1) and a non-Indigenous urbanized control group (from Juazeiro city, state of Bahia). The current analysis was carried out as an ancillary study of the Project of Atherosclerosis among Indigenous Populations (PAI) study.\nThe PAI study protocol has been previously described in detail [18]. In summary, PAI was initiated in 2016 as an observational study, whose primary aim was to access cardiovascular health in two Indigenous groups with different degrees of urbanization and a totally urbanized control group. The PAI study included individuals of both sexes, 30 to 70 years old, without known cardiovascular disease or renal failure requiring hemodialysis, who provided authorization to conduct the study and signed the informed consent term [10,18]. The initial phase of the PAI study was completed in 2017, after including a total of 1061 participants: 321 from Fulni-\u00f4 tribe, 351 from Truk\u00e1 tribe, and 389 from the city of Juazeiro.\nThe following three groups were included: one Indigenous tribe characterized by low level of urbanization (Fulni-\u00f4, located on the banks of the Ipanema River in the S\u00e3o Francisco Basin); one tribe already affected by the urbanization process (Truk\u00e1, whose territory is crossed by the northern axis of the S\u00e3o Francisco River Transposition Project); and a control group located in a city with a totally urbanized area and a low profile of migration in the municipality of Juazeiro, Bahia, which is also on the banks of the S\u00e3o Francisco River [18].\nThe Fulni-\u00f4 Indigenous tribe is located in the municipalities of \u00c1guas Belas and Ita\u00edba, in the agreste region of the state of Pernambuco, and it comprises an area of 12,000 m2 with 4,689 people, showing signs of less urbanization [18]. Once a year, the Fulni-\u00f4 people are required to be confined in isolation from non-Indigenous people for three months in a separate area adjacent to the tribe for the ritual known as Ouricuri. The Fulni-\u00f4 is the only Indigenous group in Northeast Brazil to maintain their original language for daily use [9,18].\nThe Truk\u00e1 group, on the other hand, comprises people located in the semi-arid region of the same state, in the middle of the S\u00e3o Francisco River; the population comprises 2,981 people, in an area of 6,000 m2, in the municipality of Cabrob\u00f3, on the island known as Ilha de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o or Ilha Grande, which is part of the archipelago of Asunci\u00f3n, showing anthropological signs of greater urbanization [9,18]. They are known as a rural community. The geographical locations of the Truk\u00e1, Fulni-\u00f4, and control group are shown in Fig 1.\nMap base layers were obtained from <http://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/> covered by a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

In this context, the Fulni-\u00f4 group has no paved roads, and their houses are more isolated. Furthermore, they practice an annual three-month period of isolation from non-Indigenous peoples, in a ritual known as Ouricuri, and they preserve their original language, Yath\u00ea, in schools, along with Portuguese [18,19]. From this point of view, the Fulni-\u00f4 group was considered to be less urbanized. In contrast with the Fulni-\u00f4, the Truk\u00e1 group presents intermediate characteristics of urbanization, with lifestyle changes and major infrastructural landscape transformation [18,19].\nBoth groups are assisted by a family group of health professionals, comprising a physician, a nurse, and a group of assistants and local community workers.\nWeight, age, height, and body mass index (BMI) were collected from August 2016 (EW 34) to June 2017 (EW 22), in two collection periods. During EW 34/2016, anthropometric data and biological samples were collected only in the Fulni-\u00f4 group. In EW 22/2017, a second moment of anthropometric data and biological sample collection was performed, not only in the Fulni-\u00f4 group, but also in the Truk\u00e1 tribe and in the control group. Data collection followed the criteria of the PAI Study [19]. For analysis, age was stratified as 30 to 40 years, 41 to 50 years, 51 to 60 years, and 61 to 70 years.\nObesity has been described as a major risk factor for severe clinical presentations of arbovirosis [17]. Therefore, we included obesity data in our analysis, as measured by BMI, according to the World Health Organization recommendations. In relation to BMI (kg/m2), individuals were classified in a simplified manner as underweight (< 18\u00b75), normal (\u2265 18\u00b75 and < 25), overweight (\u2265 25 and < 30), and obese (\u2265 30), in accordance with the World Health Organization [21].\nPeripheral blood collections were also performed between EW 34/2016 and EW 22/2017 with right or left antecubital fossa venipuncture. After appropriate antisepsis, 5 to 10 ml of venous blood were removed and transported in refrigerated boxes at 2 to 8\u00b0C. Afterwards, serum was centrifuged in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and conserved at \u221220 to \u221270\u00b0C. These samples were stored at the Instituto Gon\u00e7alo Moniz, FIOCRUZ Bahia and the Laboratory of Clinical Analysis, LPC, Salvador, Bahia.\nSerological tests for anti-chikungunya virus IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Euromimmun (Code: EI 293a-9601G) were performed following manufacturer instructions. Values with relative index \u2265 1\u00b71 were considered positive; values \u2265 0\u00b78 and < 1\u00b71 were considered borderline, and values < 0\u00b78 were considered negative. Serological tests were performed on 451 participants of the PAI study who agreed to be included and who had viable serum samples at the time the test became available for the study, during 2019. Only 3 borderline samples from the Fulni-\u00f4 group were discarded. A total of 15 lipemic, icteric, hemolyzed, or failed samples were discarded from the 3 groups. No other serological tests were performed for other arboviruses in this study.\nAlthough cross-reaction is a challenge in seroprevalence studies for arbovirus, it is particularly problematic in arboviruses of the same family, such as dengue fever, yellow fever, and, more recently, Zika fever [22]. Regarding CHIKV, commercial ELISA diagnostic tests were evaluated, and they showed specificity and sensitivity of 95% and 88%, respectively, for IgG, with 18% false positive for IgM ELISA [23]. In addition, the EuroImmun anti-CHIKV ELISA IgG assay (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcebeck, Germany) showed 95\u00b74% sensitivity and 100% specificity in validation studies on another specific population, in previous studies [24].\nSample size calculation for the PAI study was previously described [18,19], computing a total of 957 participants (319 from each of the three groups). For this ancillary study, the calculated sample size was a total of 364 participants, considering a population of 7580 Indigenous people, 95% confidence interval (CI), 5% precision, and an estimated prevalence of CHIKV of 46%, based on a previous prevalence study for a municipality in the state of Bahia in December 2015 [25,26], using an online tool <http://sampsize.sourceforge.net/iface/>. Our hypothesis was that the groups with lower degrees of urbanization, socio-cultural confinement behavior and conditions strongly related to worse sanitation and health education would have the highest prevalence of CHIKV.\nThe choice of a municipality in Bahia (also located in the Northeast Region) as a reference for the prevalence estimated in the sample calculation was due to the absence of seroprevalence data in the regions close to the tribes. Furthermore, this municipality has climatic and demographic similarities with the cities where the Truk\u00e1 and Fulni-\u00f4 groups are located [27].\nData were entered into the SPSS computer program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, Release 16\u00b70\u00b72, 2008) twice, with automatic consistency and amplitude checking. Categorical variables were presented as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables were presented as median (first\u2013third quartiles) after verification of data normality by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The frequency of infection by CHIKV was described in terms of percentage and respective 95% CI. In univariate analysis, positive and negative individuals were compared by Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson\u2019s chi-square (\u03c72) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The prevalence ratio was programmed to be calculated, using a multivariable model, only for those variables that showed a p value < 0\u00b72 in the univariate analysis.\nA total of 433 individuals with full available serological and clinical data were included; the majority were young women. Of the total, 124 (36\u00b77%) individuals were considered obese, and 131 (38\u00b78%) were considered overweight (Table 1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009468.t001\nThe prevalence of anti-CHIKV IgG was 49\u00b79% (216/433; 95% CI: 45\u00b71\u201354\u00b77). When evaluated separately by group, 3 (5\u00b78%; 95% CI: 1\u00b721\u201316), 213 (78\u00b73%; 95% CI: 72\u00b79\u201383\u00b71), and 0 (zero) positive individuals were observed in the control, Fulni-\u00f4, and Truk\u00e1 groups, respectively. When we evaluated the Fulni-\u00f4 individuals by collection period (EW 34/2016 and EW 22/2017), we observed that the percentage of individuals who were positive for anti-CHIKV IgG was maintained (79\u00b76% and 78\u00b71%, respectively).\nConsidering all participants, no significant associations were observed in CHIKV IgG seropositivity (n = 216; 49\u00b79%) according to sex (male: 45\u00b79%; female: 52\u00b72%; p = 0\u00b7208) or age group (30 to 40 years: 52\u00b73%; 41 to 50 years: 46\u00b76%; 51 to 60 years: 48\u00b77%; 61 to 70 years: 52\u00b78%; p = 0\u00b7618). On the other hand, in relation to groups separated by degrees of urbanization, the Fulni-\u00f4 tribe showed a higher proportion of anti-CHIKV IgG in comparison to the Truk\u00e1 tribe and the control group, and this was not associated with sex, age group, or BMI categories (Table 2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009468.t002\nConsidering participants anti-CHIKV IgG seropositives, there were no significant differences in median age between Fulni-\u00f4 people and urbanized controls (47\u00b70; IQR: 37\u00b70\u201354\u00b70 years vs. 49\u00b70; IQR: 41\u00b70\u201359\u00b70 years, respectively; p = 0\u00b7528), or regarding median values of BMI (28\u00b71; IQR: 25\u00b72\u201330\u00b77 kg/m2 vs. 30\u00b71; IQR: 29\u00b78\u201332\u00b75 kg/m2, respectively; p = 0\u00b7354). Also, there was no significant difference in median age or median values of BMI when assessing anti-CHIKV IgG seropositive and negative participants in these groups (S1 Table).\nOur study shows a high seroprevalence of CHIKV in one traditional Indigenous ethnicity, out of three study groups with different stages of urbanization and diverse environmental conditions. Our results suggest that the most traditional, less urbanized Indigenous community was the one most exposed to CHIKV, as demonstrated by the highest serological rate of infection.\nVariable results of anti-CHIKV seropositivity have been found in urbanized areas in Brazil. A study evaluated the prevalence in two cities in the state of Bahia, Feira de Santana and Riach\u00e3o do Jacu\u00edpe, showing a total seropositivity of 51% in December 2015 [25], whereas, in Chapada, a district of Riach\u00e3o do Jacu\u00edpe, a rate of 20% positivity was observed in April 2016, and 11.8% seropositivity was observed in a community of Salvador, Bahia between November 2016 and January 2017 [28,29]. An epidemiological study evaluating two nearby regions, with the same climatic conditions during the same EWs, found different prevalences of 57\u00b71% and 45\u00b77% [25]. This difference in seroprevalence in areas with similar climatic and geographical characteristics is possibly related to several factors, such as population density, sampling type, degree of vector mosquito infestation, sanitary structure of neighborhoods, and commercial activity in the city [10,11,25].\nThe present report draws attention to the fact that CHIKV seems to have had a particular impact on the Fulni-\u00f4 people, the least urbanized Indigenous group in the Northeast Region of Brazil, showing more than 70% seroprevalence, in contrast to the absence of anti-CHIKV IgG in the Truk\u00e1 tribe. This significant and unexpected result in the Fulni-\u00f4 tribe differs from most epidemiological studies in the Americas, where estimated and found prevalence has been less than 50% [28\u201330]. To date, few studies have recorded such high prevalences. Among those that have, we highlight 75% in Comoros Island in 2004, 63% in Kenya in 2005 [31,32], and 75\u00b76% in Haiti, in children aged 2 to 14 years, in 2014 [33]. It is, however, important to mention that these studies were conducted in non-Indigenous communities, with different degrees of urbanization.\nInterestingly, our findings suggest that the more traditional Indigenous tribes might have very particular epidemiological dynamics, regarding viral outbreaks. On the other hand, when assessing non-Indigenous areas around the Fulni-\u00f4 tribe (\u00c1guas Belas and Ita\u00edba), official data indicate a low rate of notification of suspected cases based on clinical evaluation, considering the cumulative period of 2015 to 2020. Importantly, there are no official data on serological prevalence of CHIKV in this area. The municipality of \u00c1guas Belas has a population of 40,235 people, and it reported a total of 167 suspected cases in 2016, remaining below 12 cases/year in subsequent years (2017 to 2020). The municipality of Ita\u00edba (total population of 26,256 people), which is adjacent to \u00c1guas Belas, reported 143 cases of CHIKV between the years 2015 and 2017. In 2016, of the 167 cases of suspected CHIKV notified in \u00c1guas Belas, 55% were confirmed by laboratory and/or clinical epidemiological criteria. Of the total of 11 cases notified in Ita\u00edba for 2017, only 1 case was confirmed by serological testing. The raw data for the non-Indigenous municipalities were acquired from the official epidemiological vigilance and are available as Supplementary Material (S1 and S2 Appendices).\nRegarding the degree of urbanization in isolated communities, our study also differs from previous assessment of seroprevalence of dengue in the Yukpa (most influenced by urbanization, concerning aspects of the physical landscape, house structure, sanitation conditions, as well as population traffic) and Bar\u00ed Indigenous groups, in Sierra de Perija, Venezuela, which found higher prevalence in the most urbanized tribe, with greater transit of individuals with the virus within the community, precarious health structure, and higher infestation of Ae. Aegypti [15].\nThere are no official data for vector mosquito presence that are specific for the studied tribes. Nevertheless, since 2002, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has been conducting a survey in the nearby cities (Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey LIRAa). It consists of a method of monitoring the levels of infestation of Ae. aegypti larvae in homes, performed by periodical sampling technique, allowing an entomo-epidemiological survey of the region [34]. In 2017, \u00c1guas Belas showed an Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey of 2.0, which is considered alert, while, in the city of Cabrob\u00f3 (adjacent to where the Truk\u00e1 tribe is located), the index was 0\u00b72, which is considered low. In the same period, the city of Juazeiro (control group) showed an Index of 0\u00b78 (considered low or satisfactory) [34]. The different levels of infestation of the vector mosquito might partially explain the higher prevalence of CHIKV in the Fulni-\u00f4 people, when compared to the Truk\u00e1 people.\nAnother important aspect for our finding of diverse CHIKV prevalence ratios may be the specifics of weather conditions in different regions. While the tribes are located along the S\u00e3o Francisco River Valley, in an area with tropical climate, the Fulni-\u00f4 group is located in the agreste region, where rainfall is slightly higher than in the Truk\u00e1 group area; this may favor greater vector mosquito infestation. [35]. However, this does not fully explain our results, given that other cities with similar weather conditions show variable notifications of suspected CHIKF cases in the same period [36].\nThere has been much discussion about the role of poorly planned urbanization and disorderly growth in the health of the population, especially with regard to contagious or insect borne diseases [37]. The high prevalence of CHIKV in the Fulni-\u00f4 people may be favored by the degree of urbanization, with unpaved streets, houses that preserve original constructions, which are partly made of clay, and less sanitary structure [9,18]. The Fulni-\u00f4 people also struggle for access to adequate water supply, and they usually store still water, what might be related to mosquito proliferation. This association of CHIKV with the condition of socioeconomic vulnerability has already been identified in previous studies in the Americas, including in a non-Indigenous community in the Brazilian Northeast [28,38]. These factors, in conjunction with a lifestyle characterized by social coexistence, with strong cultural exchange between families and the preservation of confinement rituals (Ouricuri), have probably influenced the high rate of infectivity and transmissibility, since people live close together with multiple close social interactions, in the same environment of the mosquito vector, making the Fulni-\u00f4 Indigenous Reserve an environment conducive to maintaining humans in the viral cycle over the years [9,18].\nThis study has important limitations that must be considered. Serology was not conducted for other arboviruses that are prevalent in Brazil, and potential serological cross-reactions could not be addressed. The sample was not homogeneous with respect to the proportion of participants in each subgroup. There was a gap between the blood sample collection and the serum analysis. We assessed all blood samples that were properly stored in a sufficient amount for serological testing. The number of tested participants exceeded the sample size estimate, but a relevant number of participants from the main PAI study were not included in this ancillary analysis. Furthermore, there was a lack of clinical data to analyze the association of signs and symptoms with seroprevalence data; thus, we could not address the entire dimension of the clinical relevance related to the chikungunya disease burden in these Indigenous populations. It is, however, necessary to highlight that working with closed populations, who are distant from large urban centers and who have distinct social behaviors, makes it difficult to execute projects in this profile, in addition to the intrinsic logistical limitations to approach and data collection in more isolated populations of difficult access.\nChikungunya compromises quality of life, interfering with social and work relationships and often leading to psychiatric disorders [39,40]. This acutely debilitating febrile illness is a serious public health problem, with the risk of evolving into chronic forms. Indigenous people in the Americas have been through known recurrent infectious diseases outbreaks since colonial times, but little is known regarding the dynamics of the disease, as well as the long-term impact on these populations [41]. It is important to understand the epidemiological dynamics of chikungunya, as well as other new infectious diseases, in traditional vulnerable populations such as Indigenous people, in order to aid public health policies directed to the management of chronic forms of the disease and the control of future outbreaks.\nIn conclusion, our study shows a high serological prevalence for CHIKV in a traditional Indigenous population (Fulni-\u00f4) in the S\u00e3o Francisco Valley between 2016 and 2017, regardless of age and sex. This finding differs from the low prevalence found in the more urbanized Truk\u00e1 people and in the non-Indigenous urban control group, although all communities are located in the same region. Understanding the dynamics of epidemics in various locations and their peculiarities in diverse population groups will allow for more appropriate planning of prevention and containment of future epidemics.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009468.s001\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009468.s002\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009468.s003\nWe would like to thank the Executive Secretariat of Health Surveillance, particularly the members of the team of the Arboviruses Surveillance Management of the State of Pernambuco and V Regional Health Management for their collaborative efforts on the interpretation of the official data for non-Indigenous areas.

Harold Mitchell Jr., ReGenesis Community Development Corp. founder and executive director, and member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council\nLow-income communities and communities of color have been confronted with environmental injustice for decades, and even centuries, in the United States.2 From toxic dumps to polluting power plants, oil refineries, chemical companies, and other industrial facilities concentrated in their neighborhoods, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people have been forced to endure dangerous and life-threatening environmental and health risks. These troubling conditions are compounded by the harms of racial and economic inequality.\nWhile action to end systemic racism is long past due, President Joe Biden\u2019s commitment to direct 40 percent of his administration\u2019s climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities marks a turning point in the fight for justice.3 He solidified this commitment by launching the Justice40 Initiative through the landmark climate executive order he signed in 2021. This initiative aims to begin to redress the high levels of pollution, chronic disinvestment, and lack of access to capital in communities of color and low-income areas driven by discriminatory environmental, housing, infrastructure, and economic policies. Achieving the Justice40 goal would set the country on a course to correcting persistent injustice by mobilizing substantial new investments in legacy pollution cleanup, pollution-free energy and transportation, workforce development, quality and affordable housing, and critical clean water infrastructure in communities that need it the most.4\nTo accelerate the delivery of investment benefits to communities on the front lines of environmental, racial, and economic injustice, as well as communities dependent on the fossil fuel industry for their livelihoods, the White House must direct federal agencies to remove funding barriers and strengthen existing programs where needed.5 Specifically, the national climate advisor, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and agency leaders must take the following immediate actions to implement the Justice40 Initiative:\nMany of these\u2014and other actions\u2014were recommended by the first-ever White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council (WHEJAC), one of President Biden\u2019s signature initiatives.8 The WHEJAC includes 26 of the nation\u2019s top environmental justice leaders and scholars, and its guidance is essential to achieving the president\u2019s Justice40 goal.9 According to Richard Moore, co-coordinator of the Los Jardines Institute and co-chair of the WHEJAC:\nThe WHEJAC\u2019s recommendations are the product of bringing the expertise and perspectives of environmental justice communities to the table. Communities of color and low-income communities\u2014both urban and rural\u2014have suffered the most from our country\u2019s intersecting health, economic, racial and climate crises. We must continue to dismantle the systemic racism that perpetuates these crises, and ensure our communities are being heard at the highest levels of government.10\nIf implemented effectively and deliberately, the initiative can begin to accelerate long-overdue progress toward environmental, racial, and economic justice. In addition to achieving the Justice40 goal, the Biden administration must act immediately to integrate environmental justice into the development of all national climate policies to improve the health, safety, and well-being of all Americans.\nThis report details the actions needed to implement Justice40 and deliver real and measurable benefits to environmentally, and other, disadvantaged communities.\n\u201cThe voices of the communities that have suffered for too long from legacies of pollution and inequality are finally being heard. Through the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, we finally have the seat at the table that we deserve. We know how to remedy the problems that have been placed in our communities, and our recommendations should form the foundation from which the Biden-Harris administration builds its policies to correct environmental, economic, and climate injustice.\u201d11\nFor many Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, exposure to high levels of toxic pollution is a hazard of daily life. Fossil fuel production and refinement facilities, such as oil wells, oil refineries, natural gas facilities, and power plants, are more frequently permitted in more vulnerable communities.12 A recent study found that the fine particulate matter\u2014the deadliest air pollutant\u2014emitted by almost every major fossil fuel source disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Asian Americans, irrespective of ZIP code and income.13\nAnd all too often, communities of color and low-income areas are assaulted by numerous sources of pollution, leaving residents to deal with the cumulative impacts of these toxins.14 For example, Newark, New Jersey, with its rich and vibrant community culture, is surrounded by a highly trafficked international airport, highways packed with diesel trucks, a large seaport, a waste incinerator, a Superfund site (which is a piece of land contaminated by hazardous materials), and heavy industrial facilities, all of which spew toxic pollutants into the surrounding air, water, and land.15 As a result, 1 in 4 children in Newark have asthma, and Newark\u2019s kids \u201care hospitalized for asthma at 30 times the national rate.\u201d16\nLong-term exposure to high levels of pollution causes higher rates of cancer, asthma, and other serious health problems.17 Simultaneously, redlining and discriminatory housing policies that discouraged lending in communities of color have led to disinvestment, concentrated poverty, and insurmountable barriers to accumulating wealth to pass on to the next generation.18 Decades of systemic racism in housing policy and the unequal pollution burden from power plants, industrial facilities, and highways has led to a correlation between high concentrations of pollution in communities of color and low rates of business loans and mortgages.19\n\u201cEnvironmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color\u2014so-called \u2018fenceline communities\u2019\u2014especially those communities\u2014brown, Black, Native American, poor whites. It\u2019s hard\u2014the hard-hit areas like Cancer Alley \u2026 in Louisiana, or the Route 9 corridor in the state of Delaware.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to work to make sure that they receive 40 percent of the benefits of key federal investments in clean energy, clean water, and wastewater infrastructure. Lifting up these communities makes us all stronger as a nation and increases the health of everybody.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s historic that we are able to represent our communities who are on the frontlines of environmental injustices through WHEJAC. \u2026 We must continue to focus on environmental justice in climate policy and ensure it goes beyond WHEJAC: It must be integrated into the development of all national climate policies.\u201d21\n\u2013 Former State Rep. Harold Mitchell Jr., ReGenesis Community Development Corp. founder and executive director, and member of the WHEJAC\nEnvironmental justice advocates have long called for an end to environmental racism, and for \u201cthe just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, or ability, with respect to the development, implementation, enforcement, and evaluation of laws, regulations, programs, policies, practices, and activities, that affect human health and the environment.\u201d22\u00a0President Biden is responding to these calls with a commitment to\u00a0deliver 40 percent of the climate investment benefits to disadvantaged communities aims to begin redressing historic injustice and inequity by mobilizing significant new resources to the communities that sorely need them, including communities of color and environmental justice (EJ) communities.\nThe White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council defines EJ communities as \u201cgeographic location[s] with significant representation of persons of color, low-income persons, indigenous persons, or members of Tribal nations, where such persons experience, or are at risk of experiencing, higher or more adverse human health or environmental outcomes.\u201d23 To effectively implement Justice40 over the long term, federal agencies will likely need to create new programs that are intentionally designed to repair the inequities created by unfair and harmful federal housing and other policies that have entrenched disparities in Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities. In the near term, however, the Biden administration must leverage existing federal programs to make immediate progress on implementing the Justice40 goal, including programs that support affordable housing and other community infrastructure in disadvantaged communities, as well as workforce and community development, legacy pollution cleanup, and more.24\nThe administration should develop a definition for disadvantaged communities that includes Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian, and other communities of color and low-income communities in rural and urban areas; environmental justice communities; front-line or fence-line communities overburdened by pollution, climate change effects, or both; communities historically reliant on the fossil fuel industry for their livelihoods; and communities with health, wealth, income, and other disparities.\nIn addition to the WHEJAC recommendations for defining disadvantaged communities, the White House may wish to consider other factors, including: low percentage of dwellings with an internet connection; high eviction rates; high percentages of households with limited English proficiency; and high unemployment rates.\nIn his January 27 executive order on climate change, President Biden directed the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, and the WHEJAC to publish recommendations on Justice40 implementation that \u201creflect existing authorities the agencies may possess for achieving the 40-percent goal as well as recommendations on any legislation needed to achieve the 40-percent goal.\u201d25 The executive order also directs federal agency heads to identify federal programs that are applicable to Justice40 implementation and to develop investment guidance for program staff by late July.26\nThe WHEJAC submitted recommendations to President Biden and the CEQ in May to guide the implementation of the president\u2019s environmental justice commitments, including Justice40. Among the recommendations is a call for \u201ca transformative and accountable process developed for the fair and just distribution of 40 percent or more of the benefits to be invested in frontline communities.\u201d27 Without such a process, the WHEJAC warned that federal investments will not reach or benefit front-line communities, \u201cgiven the bias and ambivalence of many state and local governments, and the systemic racial bias, inertia, and resistance to change that we must never underestimate.\u201d\nTo successfully implement Justice40, the Biden administration must confront the difficult reality that the communities that are most in need of resources often have the greatest difficulty accessing federal program funding. Even when communities are eligible to receive federal funds, they face a range of challenges that can prevent the delivery of real and measurable benefits, such as sustainable, equitable, and resilient community development and pollution-free transportation and energy. These challenges include:\n\u201cThe Justice40 commitment has the potential to make transformative investments in environmental justice communities. To seize this critical opportunity, we must ensure Justice40 is implemented to its\u00a0fullest potential and in a manner guided by environmental justice values and principles.\u201d\nExisting federal programs must be updated and strengthened to increase the benefits provided to disadvantaged communities, including communities of color; low-income communities; and communities exposed to disproportionate environmental, health, and other socioeconomic burdens. The Biden administration should implement the changes described below, working with Congress when necessary.\nIn many cases, existing federal program guidance and criteria fall short of what is needed to ensure that federal investments deliver real benefits to Black, Latinx, Indigenous, low-income, and other disadvantaged communities. In addition, federal programs miss opportunities to maximize project benefits or avoid unintentional harms to the communities that they are aiming to benefit. For example, many federal programs do not have criteria to help ensure that federal investments support pollution reductions, address climate change, or avoid the displacement of community members.\nProgram criteria are, in some cases, too stringent, while in others they are too loose. If program criteria are too strict, there is a risk that some communities that could benefit from the program will not be eligible for aid or that certain investments that address high-priority community needs will not qualify. For example, the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) supports home energy efficiency improvements to reduce energy use and utility bills. Yet homeowners or renters who cannot afford or do not have the authority to keep up with needed home or building repairs may not be eligible for the program. Currently, WAP does not cover the cost of making outstanding home repairs, which can make the cost of energy improvements too high to meet the program\u2019s cost-benefit tests.29 The program could better reach low-income families by expanding its scope to support basic home repairs that are a prerequisite to efficiency and weatherization improvements, such as replacing leaky roofs, repairing siding, and addressing plumbing issues. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could also consider expanding WAP to include home improvements needed to protect against flooding and other damage from more extreme weather driven by climate change, including grading soil or lawn away from buildings, planting trees and shrubs, raising electrical outlets, installing sump pumps, or elevating homes.30\u00a0Also, weatherization programs need to go further in investing in multifamily rental units where many low- and moderate-income households cannot access energy efficiency upgrades due to complicated enrollment processes, proof-of-eligibility requirements, landlord approval requirements, or lack of funding to cover these more expensive retrofits.\nConversely, if program criteria or guidance are too loose, then grantees may use federal funds to invest in projects that do not directly benefit communities. Currently, several programs offer broad guidance on how to use project funds. The benefit is that funding recipients can avoid having to adhere to strict guidelines. For example, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program allocates funds to cities, counties, and states for community development projects in low-income neighborhoods, and recipients are allowed a lot of leeway to decide how the money is spent. The downside is that instead of supporting new and innovative community development projects, CDBG funds are often used to cover existing expenses and fill budget gaps.31 In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the CDBG\u2019s administering agency, may overstate the proportion of CDBG funds that actually benefit low-income communities.32 Some CDBG grantees also have stated that they would prefer more guidance on how to use funds effectively.33\nTo ensure the Justice40 commitment brings real benefits to disadvantaged communities, the Biden administration must gather community input to develop clear-cut guidance for how funding recipients can successfully design projects that meet community priorities and deliver direct benefits.\nIn addition, federal agencies such as HUD should expand their field offices and staff capacity to support funding recipients in developing projects that incorporate community input and match the needs on the ground. The report from the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council recommends \u201cestablish[ing] outreach offices to promote awareness of federal program funding opportunities among EJ organizations and communities.\u201d34\nFederal agencies should also develop strong investment criteria to ensure that communities benefit from federally funded projects in both the near and long terms. Federal agencies should be wary of projects that continue or increase emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic air pollutants, which contribute to climate change and public health risks and disproportionately affect people of color.35 For example, the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s Low or No Emission Vehicles program supports the purchase or leasing of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses. While low-emission buses, such as those powered by natural gas, are an improvement relative to traditional diesel-fueled buses, they emit greenhouse gases and air pollutants that can harm the community. To reduce health and climate change risks, federal programs must ensure that proposed projects will reduce local air and water pollution, soil contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions to the greatest extent possible.\nSimilarly, although President Biden reinstated the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard that was rolled back by the Trump administration, most federal programs do not require projects they support to be built to withstand more extreme heat and more powerful storms tied to climate change.36 As a result, some federally funded projects may not adequately protect communities from and prepare them for extreme heat and other extreme weather\u2014for example, by using high-efficiency air conditioning and building designs and planting shade trees. The White House should require all federally funded projects to be built to withstand climate change effects in order to ensure that communities are not left with damaged infrastructure and costly repairs.\nIn addition, funds for economic and community development projects may drive up the cost of living and lead to the gentrification of predominantly Black neighborhoods and other neighborhoods of color, forcing existing community members to move to lower-rent areas that are often further away from economic opportunities and critical services. For example, funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Brownfields Cleanup Grants were used to partially remediate the area that is now the New York City High Line, a former abandoned railroad track turned into an urban greenspace.37 The surrounding area completely transformed after it opened in 2009 and many local businesses and longtime residents were forced out.38 Gentrification often follows the construction and completion of projects that were meant to benefit the existing community, such as parks, contaminated site cleanups, and new businesses.39 Federal agencies must ensure that program funds do not lead to the displacement of the community members they were intended to benefit. The WHEJAC recommends that agencies develop project criteria to ensure that Justice40 investments do not price existing residents out of their communities.40\nLastly, developers of projects that are supported by federal funding must engage the community during the project design phase. Stakeholder engagement is essential to identifying and meeting community needs and priorities and allowing residents to speak for themselves. A respectful and inclusive stakeholder engagement process that starts early in the project design process will help ensure that federal dollars support projects that bring direct benefits to communities, as required by the Justice40 commitment. As the WHEJAC report on Justice40 states, \u201cAll investments should incorporate a community driven, community controlled approach so that communities most directly impacted benefit as intended.\u201d41\nCurrent federal program guidance and criteria to address pollution, climate change, community displacement, and stakeholder engagement ranges from nonexistent to somewhat robust and usually depends on the agency administering the program. For example, programs administered by HUD, such as the CDBG Program, have stronger anti-displacement guidelines than programs administered by the EPA, such as the Brownfields Program. The EPA\u2019s programs tend to have stronger criteria when it comes to climate change resilience and pollution reductions. Many federal programs call for some degree of stakeholder engagement, but most do not require it during the application process, preventing residents from having a say in what projects are being funded in their communities.\nIdeally, all federal programs, regardless of the administering agency, would have criteria to ensure that federally funded projects, especially in environmental justice communities, achieve the following: a reduction in local pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the greatest extent possible; a reduction in the risks and impacts of current and future climate change effects; avoidance of community member displacement; and meaningful stakeholder engagement.\nThe WHEJAC report recommends that all federal programs \u201cshould have criteria to address pollution, climate change, and displacement of people and communities to help ensure that benefits are delivered to EJ communities.\u201d42 Table 1 presents examples of program criteria language that agencies could build on to ensure that program investments deliver community benefits and support progress toward the Justice40 goal. These examples were included in the WHEJAC report and the Justice40 recommendations developed through convenings with environmental justice advocates, academic experts, and national environmental group representatives co-hosted by the Equitable and Just National Climate Forum, The New School\u2019s Tishman Environment and Design Center, and the Center for American Progress.43 Agencies should tailor criteria to each program and ensure that they are achievable without overburdening applicants.\nTo even have a shot at accessing federal funding, applicants\u2014often city, county, or tribal governments; community groups; or other not-for-profit organizations\u2014must follow rigorous, cumbersome, and often duplicative application processes.44 For example, for the EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, applicants seeking a grant of $30,000 or less must complete multiple forms and provide extensive documentation, including a project narrative, an itemized budget, project performance metrics, resumes for key personnel, proof of nonprofit status, and a staff roster and wages.45 Requirements to access larger funding amounts\u2014for example, from the EPA\u2019s Superfund and Brownfield programs\u2014are even more onerous.\nMany eligible grantees who are in desperate need of federal funds do not have the bandwidth or expertise to meet the application requirements. Completing and submitting federal funding applications alone can take several days, or even weeks, of staff time with no guarantee that funds will be granted. In contrast, community organizations or local governments with more resources often have the staff capacity or hire consultants to prepare federal applications and access project funds. The effect is clear: FEMA records show low-income communities made up only 10 percent of the applications submitted for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program for the fiscal year 2021 grant cycle, which is intended to help communities prepare for natural disasters and specifically encouraged low-income communities to apply.46\nEven if applicants are successful in securing federal grants, program reporting requirements can be heavy and burdensome.47 Most federal programs mandate quarterly and final reports and post-project information on implementation details, environmental results, job creation, and more. Many agencies require grantees to use complicated portals, technical tools, and spreadsheets for reporting, which community groups and other grantees in disadvantaged communities may not have the training to use. If grantees fail to meet reporting and other program requirements, it can count against them in future applications.48\nThe White House should require federal agencies to review and overhaul existing application and reporting requirements to ensure that they are straightforward, reasonable, and easy to follow. Agencies should also provide a user-friendly, multilingual process to request application materials and portals for reporting, and allow applications to be submitted in languages other than English. In addition, agencies should simplify application instructions, including by removing complex government jargon and consolidating required forms. Agencies also should increase the size and number of capacity-building grants for nonprofits and community organizations that serve disadvantaged communities. For community development and environmental justice grants, agencies should extend grant periods to allow organizations time to build capacity and adapt, as recommended in the \u201cGreenlined Economy Guidebook.\u201d49As the WHEJAC rightly points out, \u201ctransformative investments must be made in capacity building, technical assistance, and consultation, and creating a user-friendly federal process for the administration of funding and other support.\u201d50\nIn addition, agencies should dedicate more, and multilingual, staff to help applicants complete required forms and comply with reporting requirements. Agency staff should be required to undergo rigorous anti-racist and anti-bias training, one of many steps needed to \u201creverse racial inequities and strive to repair the environmental injustice of more than 500 years of institutional policies and practices,\u201d a key Justice40 objective identified by the WHEJAC.51\nLastly, a number of programs aimed at helping disadvantaged communities have cost-sharing requirements, which place a substantial financial burden on city governments or other applicants representing low-income communities. The Biden administration and Congress should remove cost-sharing requirements for local governments and entities in disadvantaged communities seeking funding for projects that advance progress toward the Justice40 goal.\nTo make immediate progress toward the Justice40 commitment, Congress and the administration must ensure that their proposals to support economic recovery and upgrade the nation\u2019s infrastructure direct 40 percent or more of the investment benefits to disadvantaged communities. This can be achieved in a number of ways.\nSeveral federal programs that benefit disadvantaged communities allocate funds based on a formula. For example, for Community Development Block Grant funds, 70 percent goes to larger cities and urban counties (known as entitlement communities) and 30 percent goes to states. The state funds are then allotted to smaller, midsized communities that are not eligible to be entitlement communities. Overall, 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income (LMI) people. However, the criteria for entitlement communities is based on population instead of need, so funds often go to wealthier communities with less pressing wish lists than Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities harmed by systemic racism and discriminatory housing, infrastructure, and other policies.52 Also, rural communities can face elevated environmental and public health risks, such as from concentrated animal feeding operations, but may have difficulty accessing CDBG funds due to their smaller populations.53 As the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council rightly notes in its report to the president, \u201ccurrently some communities are severely underserved due to archaic formulas that have not been updated.\u201d54\nCongress and the administration should improve the grant formulas to ensure that funds are directed to communities with high concentrations of poverty regardless of size and to strictly limit the amount of funding distributed to wealthy communities that is intended for low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. For CDBGs specifically, Congress should create a single formula that \u201cprovides similarly needy communities with comparable funding per capita and more needy communities with more funding per capita than less needy communities,\u201d as recommended by the Urban Institute.55 Congress should also do away with designating entitlement communities based on population, and direct funds to jurisdictions in need of financial assistance, especially environmental justice communities and rural communities that are affected by the transition away from fossil fuels.\nSome independent entities, such as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and community development corporations (CDCs), exist to serve low-income communities by providing affordable and responsible lending and financial services to support equitable community development, job creation, affordable housing, local small businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which distributes funds to CDFIs and is housed at the Treasury Department, helps create economic opportunity in many of the country\u2019s most distressed communities. CDCs are nonprofits that are created to spur economic development in communities in need, but they are self-identified as such, not certified by the CDFI Fund or any other government body. Both CDCs and CDFIs aim to uplift and support their communities, yet residents can only benefit from them if they are served by one.\nThe federal government should support the creation of CDFIs and CDCs in communities that do not yet have one to further the reach of federal funds and ensure that all communities in need can access affordable lending to support sustainable economic development. Congress should follow through on President Biden\u2019s budget request for $330 million to support expanding the role of CDFIs and to create and certify CDFIs and CDCs where they are needed, with a focus on communities of color, tribal and EJ communities, and other disadvantaged communities.56 Furthermore, the administration should help facilitate the certification of CDCs as CDFIs where applicable so that CDCs have access to funding from the CDFI Fund. Lastly, CDFIs and CDCs should be required to apply the four investment criteria described in Table 1 to reduce local pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, support resilient community development, avoid community displacement, and engage community members.\nThe ReGenesis Project, a certified CDC in Spartanburg, South Carolina, has been \u201ctackling public health and environmental health issues focused on environmental justice by addressing environmental, health, social, housing, and economic needs of the community\u201d since 1998.57 In 2000, ReGenesis was awarded $20,000 by the EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice Small Grants Program. It was able to leverage that money into $300 million in public and private funding.58 Since then, ReGenesis has facilitated the cleanup of two Superfund sites and six brownfield sites, as well as the construction of 500 affordable housing units and nine health clinics, and has offered job training programs.59 It has also served as a model for community, public, and private partnerships such as the EPA\u2019s Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Model, Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program, and State EJ Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program.60\nIn May 2021, ReGenesis launched the ReGenesis Institute, which is partnering with community investors to create an environmental justice accelerator to support housing, sustainable manufacturing, clean energy, and public health projects led by front-line communities in preparation for the anticipated funds from the Justice40 Initiative.61 ReGenesis is also working to ensure there is strong oversight of Justice40 investments by supporting legislation in South Carolina to create a committee to help identify disadvantaged communities and priority needs within those communities and to ensure that Justice40 funds deliver real benefits to community members.62 ReGenesis has delivered vital services to Spartanburg and is a prime example of how community development organizations can direct federal and other funding in ways that improve the health and well-being of communities in need.\nCommunity land trusts (CLTs) are another example of a type of entity that provides vital community services and benefits and, ideally, would exist in every disadvantaged community. CLTs are nonprofit organizations that acquire land, taking it off the real estate market, and then lease the land to homeowners, businesses, or other entities that own the buildings developed on the land, including cooperative housing corporations, nonprofit developers of rental housing, and other nonprofit, governmental, or for-profit entities.63 The goals of CLTs are to help maintain community control of land and community ownership of housing and local businesses and to provide stable, affordable housing to low-income homebuyers and renters. CLTs are an important tool for preventing displacement of longtime community residents.\nThe Biden administration and Congress should work together to provide $1 billion for city and local governments and CLTs to develop and implement anti-displacement strategies. The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s HOME Investment Partnerships Program supports the construction of affordable housing by providing formula grants to states and local governments to help communities build, purchase, or upgrade affordable housing for rent and ownership. The program is the single most important source of support for CLTs.64 HUD should require non-CLT grantees (states, cities, and counties) to direct a portion of the HOME funds they receive to support CLTs.65 HUD should also increase the length of time homes must remain affordable in programs such as HOME, which currently requires minimum affordability periods of 5 years to 15 years for homeownership projects, depending on the amount of HOME funds invested in the housing units, as recommended in a CAP report on CLTs.66 CDBG recipients should also be encouraged to use a portion of their funds to back CLTs in the disadvantaged communities they support. The influx of funds to disadvantaged communities through the Justice40 Initiative is bound to spur gentrification and displacement unless intentional and thoughtful steps are taken to avoid it. CLTs are an important tool to provide stable and affordable housing as neighborhood improvements increase rents and home costs.\nWhile the above changes to federal programs are necessary to bring measurable benefits to disadvantaged communities, Congress must also increase overall funding for federal programs that serve communities in need. Federal funding for programs that benefit low-income communities has steadily declined, leaving cities, nonprofits, and other community organizations to compete with one another.67 Massive new investment in these programs will help provide affordable, energy efficient, and resilient housing; remediate legacy pollution; provide clean transit; and support sustainable community development for disadvantaged communities\u2014and can help increase capacity at agencies to facilitate these essential community improvements. A spending request letter to Congress sent by co-authors of the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform and other organizations identifies critical programs that can help achieve the Justice40 goal and how much funding they should receive.68 Examples of these programs include the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, the Community Development Financial Institution Fund, the Weatherization Assistance Program, the EPA\u2019s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Program, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Career Worker Training Program, the Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, the EPA\u2019s Superfund program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Abandoned Mine Lands program, and HUD\u2019s HOME Investment Partnerships Program, among others.\nOver the long term, the administration should also work with Congress to create new programs, including a Healthy Communities and Resilient Infrastructure Fund, as proposed by CAP; a National Environmental Justice and Climate Justice Fund, as proposed by the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform; or a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator, as proposed by Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI).69 Any new programs created to support Justice40 implementation must be developed with input from EJ advocates and other stakeholders and be intentionally designed to reach and deliver direct benefits to disadvantaged communities.\nThe Justice40 Initiative has created an unprecedented opportunity to repair the harm caused by systemic racism; unfair federal and state policies; and disinvestment in Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, as well as to help communities reliant on the fossil fuel industry as America transitions toward renewable energy sources. The Biden administration must maintain equity and environmental, racial, and economic justice as core goals of the Justice40 Initiative throughout its implementation. To ensure that the initiative effectively delivers benefits to disadvantaged communities, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, the national climate advisor, and agency heads should take the actions recommended above to strengthen program investment criteria, improve application and reporting processes, and increase federal funding for programs that serve disadvantaged communities. In addition, the Biden administration must act immediately to integrate environmental justice into the development of all national climate policies. By making these changes, the administration can accelerate progress toward addressing the widening racial wealth and health gaps; ensuring access to affordable housing, energy, and transportation; and protecting the fundamental right of every American to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live in a healthy, safe, and prosperous community.70\nCathleen Kelly is a senior fellow for Energy and Environment at the Center for American Progress.\nMikyla Reta is a research associate for Energy and Environment Policy at the Center.\nThe authors would like to thank Zoe Willingham, Nicole Ndumele, Lorena Roque, Jarvis Holliday, Shan\u00e9e Simhoni, Meghan Miller, and Chester Hawkins from the Center for American Progress; the Honorable Harold Mitchell Jr. from the ReGenesis Community Development Corp.; Michele Roberts from the Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform; Richard Moore from the Los Jardines Institute; Dr.\u00a0Ana Baptista from The New School\u2019s Tishman Environment and Design Center;\u00a0and the participants of Justice40 convenings co-hosted by the Equitable and Just National Climate Forum and The New School\u2019s Tishman Environment and Design Center."

unity, solidarity, and cohesion, and to open a new chapter in transatlantic relations, at a time when the security environment we face is increasingly complex.\u00a0 NATO remains the foundation of our collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00a0 NATO is a defensive Alliance and will continue to strive for peace, security, and stability in the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 We remain firmly committed to NATO\u2019s founding Washington Treaty, including that an attack against one Ally shall be considered an attack against us all, as enshrined in Article 5.\u00a0 We will continue to pursue a 360-degree approach to protect and defend our indivisible security and to fulfil NATO\u2019s three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management, and cooperative security.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO is the strongest and most successful Alliance in history.\u00a0 It guarantees the security of our territory and our one billion citizens, our freedom, and the values we share, including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.\u00a0 We are bound together by our common values, enshrined in the Washington Treaty, the bedrock of our unity, solidarity, and cohesion.\u00a0 We commit to fulfiling our responsibilities as Allies accordingly.\u00a0 We reaffirm our adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter.\u00a0 We are committed to the rules-based international order.\u00a0 We commit to reinforce consultations when the security or stability of an Ally is threatened or when our fundamental values and principles are at risk.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We face multifaceted threats, systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers, as well as growing security challenges to our countries and our citizens from all strategic directions.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security; terrorism in all its forms and manifestations remains a persistent threat to us all.\u00a0 State and non-state actors challenge the rules-based international order and seek to undermine democracy across the globe.\u00a0 Instability beyond our borders is also contributing to irregular migration and human trafficking.\u00a0 China\u2019s growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an Alliance.\u00a0 We will engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the Alliance.\u00a0 We are increasingly confronted by cyber, hybrid, and other asymmetric threats, including disinformation campaigns, and by the malicious use of ever-more sophisticated emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00a0 Rapid advances in the space domain are affecting our security.\u00a0 The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the erosion of the arms control architecture also undermine our collective security.\u00a0 Climate change is a threat multiplier that impacts Alliance security.\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territories and our populations against attack, and we will address all threats and challenges which affect Euro-Atlantic security.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We gather at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic continues to test our nations and our resilience.\u00a0 NATO and Allied militaries have supported the civilian response to the pandemic, while ensuring our collective defence and the effectiveness of our operations.\u00a0 We have also provided critical assistance to a number of partners through the delivery of vital medical supplies.\u00a0 We pay tribute to all those who combat this pandemic in our countries and around the world.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At our December 2019 meeting in London, we asked the Secretary General to carry out a forward-looking reflection process to further strengthen NATO\u2019s political dimension, including consultations.\u00a0 We recognise the important contribution of the independent group appointed by the Secretary General to support NATO 2030.\u00a0 As a result, today we agree NATO 2030 \u2013 a transatlantic agenda for the future.\u00a0 Throughout its history, NATO has continuously adapted to a changing security environment.\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda complements and builds on our ongoing political and military adaptation, strengthens our ability to deliver on the three core tasks and contributes to making our strong Alliance even stronger and ready for the future.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To that end we agree to:\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The NATO 2030 agenda sets a higher level of ambition for NATO.\u00a0 It provides clear guidelines for further adaptation to address existing, new and future threats and challenges, building on the ongoing political and military adaptation of the Alliance.\u00a0 Delivering on the NATO 2030 agenda, the three core tasks and the next Strategic Concept requires adequate resourcing through national defence expenditure and common funding.\u00a0 Based on requirements, we agree to increase such resourcing, including as necessary NATO common funding starting in 2023, taking into account sustainability, affordability and accountability.\u00a0 When we meet in 2022, we will agree, alongside the Strategic Concept, the specific requirements for additional funding up to 2030 and the resource implications across the NATO Military Budget, the NATO Security Investment Programme and the Civil Budget, as well as identify potential efficiency measures.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO\u2019s fundamental and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means.\u00a0 The evolving security environment increasingly requires us to address threats and challenges through the use of military and non-military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner.\u00a0 NATO will take a tailored and structured approach.\u00a0 NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance\u2019s three core tasks.\u00a0 It also serves as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication as an essential element to support all three of NATO\u2019s core tasks.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For more than twenty-five years, NATO has worked to build a partnership with Russia, including through the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).\u00a0 While NATO stands by its international commitments, Russia continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the NATO-Russia relationship.\u00a0 We reaffirm our decisions towards Russia agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit and all our subsequent NATO meetings.\u00a0 We have suspended all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while remaining open to political dialogue.\u00a0 Until Russia demonstrates compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities, there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.\u00a0 We will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00a0 NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.\u00a0 Decisions we have taken are fully consistent with our international commitments, and therefore cannot be regarded by anyone as contradicting the NATO-Russia Founding Act.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We call on Russia to rescind the designation of the Czech Republic and the United States as \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d and to refrain from taking any other steps inconsistent with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Russia\u2019s growing multi-domain military build-up, more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, the continued military build-up in Crimea, the deployment of modern dual-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, military integration with Belarus, and repeated violations of NATO Allied airspace, increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to its military activities, Russia has also intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.\u00a0 This includes attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; political and economic pressure and intimidation; widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory, including those who target and disrupt critical infrastructure in NATO countries.\u00a0 It also includes illegal and destructive activities by Russian Intelligence Services on Allied territory, some of which have claimed lives of citizens and caused widespread material damage.\u00a0 We stand in full solidarity with the Czech Republic and other Allies that have been affected in this way.\n13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Russia has continued to diversify its nuclear arsenal, including by deploying a suite of short- and intermediate-range missile systems that are intended to coerce NATO.\u00a0 Russia has recapitalised roughly 80 percent of its strategic nuclear forces, and it is expanding its nuclear capabilities by pursuing novel and destabilising weapons and a diverse array of dual-capable systems.\u00a0 Russia continues to use aggressive and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and has increased its ongoing emphasis on destabilising conventional exercises that include dual-capable systems.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s nuclear strategy and comprehensive nuclear weapon systems modernisation, diversification, and expansion, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons, increasingly support a more aggressive posture of strategic intimidation.\u00a0 We will continue to work closely together to address all the threats and challenges posed by Russia.\n14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova within their internationally recognised borders.\u00a0 In accordance with its international commitments, we call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in all three countries without their consent.\u00a0 We strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\u00a0 The human rights abuses and violations against the Crimean Tatars and members of other local communities must end.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s recent massive military build-up and destabilising activities in and around Ukraine have further escalated tensions and undermined security.\u00a0 We call on Russia to reverse its military build-up and stop restricting navigation in parts of the Black Sea.\u00a0 We also call on Russia to stop impeding access to the Sea of Azov and Ukrainian ports.\u00a0 We commend Ukraine\u2019s posture of restraint and diplomatic approach in this context.\u00a0 We seek to contribute to de-escalation.\u00a0 We are also stepping up our support to Ukraine.\u00a0 We call for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements by all sides, and support the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group.\u00a0 Russia, as a signatory of the Minsk Agreements, bears significant responsibility in this regard.\u00a0 We call on Russia to stop fuelling the conflict by providing financial and military support to the armed formations it backs in eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 We reiterate our full support to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.\u00a0 We stress the importance of ensuring its safety and full and unhindered access throughout the entire territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and the Russia-Ukraine border, in accordance with its mandate.\u00a0 We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia as independent states; to implement the EU-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement; to end its militarisation of these regions and attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the continued construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.\u00a0 We reiterate our firm support to the Geneva International Discussions.\u00a0 We also call on Russia to engage constructively in the Transnistria Settlement Process.\u00a0 We are committed to supporting the Republic of Moldova\u2019s democratic reforms and providing assistance through our Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative.\n15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain open to a periodic, focused, and meaningful dialogue with a Russia willing to engage on the basis of reciprocity in the NRC, with a view to avoiding misunderstanding, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, and to increase transparency and predictability.\u00a0 NRC meetings have helped us communicate clearly our positions, and we are ready for the next meeting of the NRC.\u00a0 We will continue to focus our dialogue with Russia on the critical issues we face.\u00a0 The conflict in and around Ukraine is, in current circumstances, the first topic on our agenda.\u00a0 NATO remains committed to making good use of the existing military lines of communication between both sides to promote predictability and transparency, and to reduce risks, and calls on Russia to do so as well.\u00a0 We continue to aspire to a constructive relationship with Russia when its actions make that possible.\n16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, continues to pose a direct threat to the security of our populations, and to international stability and prosperity.\u00a0 We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.\u00a0 Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.\u00a0 While nations retain the primary responsibility for their domestic security and their own resilience, the fight against terrorism demands a coherent, long-term effort by the international community as a whole, involving a wide range of instruments and actors.\u00a0 NATO\u2019s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance, and is an integral part of the Alliance\u2019s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.\u00a0 Cooperation in NATO adds value to Allies\u2019 national efforts and capacity to prevent, mitigate, respond to, and be resilient against acts of terrorism.\u00a0 We condemn all financial support of terrorism.\u00a0 We also recognise the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.\u00a0 Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on the fight against terrorism.\n17.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain fully committed to NATO\u2019s enhanced role in the international community\u2019s fight against terrorism, including through awareness and analysis, preparedness and responsiveness, capabilities, capacity building and partnerships, and operations.\u00a0 We continue to implement our 2019 Action Plan and will update it by the end of this year, to take account of the evolving terrorist threats.\u00a0 We are determined to meet our commitments under UNSCR 2396, including through NATO\u2019s new Battlefield Evidence Policy, supported by improved information and data collection, preservation, sharing, and analysis, within NATO\u2019s mandate.\u00a0 We will continue our work to defend against improvised explosive devices and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats.\u00a0 We are developing capabilities to protect our forces against terrorist misuse of technology, while capitalising on emerging technologies to help us in the fight against terrorism.\u00a0 We are also stepping up support to partner countries to fight terrorism themselves and deny terrorists safe haven, which in turn strengthens NATO\u2019s own security.\u00a0 NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with partner countries and other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity.\u00a0 NATO continues to play its part in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh, including through our Airborne Warning\u00a0& Control System (AWACS) surveillance flights and staff-to-staff support.\n18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After almost 20 years, NATO's military operations in Afghanistan are coming to an end.\u00a0 We have denied terrorists a safe haven from which to plot attacks against us, helped Afghanistan to build its security institutions, and trained, advised, and assisted the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces; they are now taking on full responsibility for security in their country.\u00a0 We pay tribute to those who have lost their lives or have been wounded, and express our deep appreciation to all the men and women who have served under the NATO flag, and to their families.\n20.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO remains a leading and active contributor to international security through operations, missions, and activities.\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their substantial contributions to these efforts. \u00a0NATO and Allies support Iraq in its fight against ISIS/Da\u2019esh and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\u00a0 We commend the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces for their continued efforts to combat ISIS/Da\u2019esh.\u00a0 Based on a request from the Iraqi Government, we will strengthen our support to Iraq through our NATO Mission Iraq.\u00a0 We will broaden our non-combat advisory, training, and capacity building mission to support Iraq in building more effective, sustainable, accountable, and inclusive security institutions and forces.\u00a0 This expansion of NATO Mission Iraq, including additional support to the Iraqi security institutions, will be demand-driven, incremental, scalable, and based on conditions on the ground.\u00a0 It will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors, including the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS/Da\u2019esh, the United Nations, and the European Union.\n21.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.\u00a0 We are united and resolute in our ability and commitment to defend one another.\u00a0 We will maintain and further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to ensure credible deterrence and defence and provide the Alliance with a wide range of options to tailor our response to specific circumstances and to respond to any threats, from state and non-state actors, from wherever they arise, and potentially from multiple directions in more than one region simultaneously.\u00a0 While reaffirming our commitment to the three core tasks, we have placed a renewed emphasis on collective defence, and have also ensured that NATO retains the ability to project stability and fight against terrorism.\n22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We welcome the significant progress already made to implement our previous decisions to strengthen NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence posture and reaffirm our commitment to their full and speedy implementation.\u00a0 We have accelerated our military adaptation with increased defence spending, modern capabilities, enhanced political and military responsiveness, and higher readiness of our forces.\u00a0 NATO is taking forward a new military strategy through the implementation of two significant military concepts that will further strengthen our ability to deter and defend against any potential adversary and to maintain and develop our military advantage now and in the future.\u00a0 The deterrence and defence concept provides a single, coherent framework to contest and deter and defend against the Alliance\u2019s main threats in a multi-domain environment, and will strengthen our preparedness to address challenges, particularly pervasive instability and strategic shocks. \u00a0The warfighting concept provides a long-term vision for maintaining and developing NATO\u2019s decisive military edge.\u00a0 The implementation of the deterrence and defence concept will guide enhanced advance planning to respond to potential crisis and conflict, as well as further improve the use and organisation of Allied forces and capabilities in all operational domains and ensure more effective command and control.\u00a0 We are developing strategic, domain-specific and regional military plans to improve our ability to respond to any contingencies and ensure timely reinforcement.\u00a0 We will emphasise persistent activities in peacetime to support deterrence, including through the presence and dynamic posture of our military forces and exercises, based on enhanced coordination amongst Allies and NATO.\u00a0 Through the implementation of the warfighting concept, we will ensure that the Alliance continuously develops its military and technological advantage, as the character of conflict evolves.\u00a0 We commit to the full implementation of these new concepts, and to taking the necessary steps to enhance the coherence between relevant national and NATO activities and plans and the concepts.\n23.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We commit to further strengthening and modernising the NATO Force Structure to meet current and future deterrence and defence needs.\u00a0 We will ensure a flexible, agile, and resilient multi-domain force architecture with the right forces in the right place at the right time.\u00a0 We will strengthen modern command and control tailored to support our 360-degree posture, dynamic force management, improved response system, and plans.\u00a0 In doing so, we will place increased emphasis on the interdependence of geography, domains, and readiness.\u00a0 As part of these overall efforts, we are committed to continue increasing the readiness of our forces and the Alliance\u2019s rapid response capability, including through the ongoing implementation of the NATO Readiness Initiative, which is designed to strengthen the culture of readiness and help to provide forces at 30 days readiness or less.\u00a0 We have sourced all the combat forces of the NATO Readiness Initiative with 30 major naval combatants, 30 heavy or medium manoeuvre battalions, and 30 kinetic air squadrons.\u00a0 They are being organised and trained as larger combat formations for reinforcement and high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis intervention.\n24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will ensure that the NATO Command Structure is robust, resilient, and able to undertake all elements of effective command and control for simultaneous challenges across all domains and the full spectrum of missions, including large-scale operations for collective defence.\u00a0 Our two new commands, Joint Force Command Norfolk headquarters and Joint Support and Enabling Command, as well as the Cyberspace Operations Centre, have achieved Initial Operational Capability.\u00a0 Allied contributions to command and control through the NATO Force Structure and national headquarters as well as their strengthened relationship with the NATO Command Structure, including by providing host nation support, remain essential to improve the Alliance\u2019s regional understanding, vigilance, and ability to rapidly respond to any threat from any direction.\n25.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will not be constrained by any potential adversary as regards the freedom of movement of Allied forces by land, air, or sea to and within any part of Alliance territory.\u00a0 Our deterrence and defence posture is underpinned by credible forces, both in-place and ready for reinforcement within Europe and from across the Atlantic.\u00a0 We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance\u2019s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.\u00a0 We will continue to give high priority, both nationally and in the Alliance, to ensuring enablement of SACEUR\u2019s Area of Responsibility to improve our ability to support the deployment and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory.\u00a0 These efforts include taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements.\u00a0 We reiterate that NATO\u2019s efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies with the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued, including with regard to military mobility related procedures that should apply to all Allies equally.\u00a0 We continue to reinforce our maritime posture and to protect our sea lines of communication.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the NATO Maritime Security Centre of Excellence in Turkey.\u00a0 We will maintain awareness of any potential threats to our critical undersea infrastructure and will continue to address them nationally and, where needed, collectively.\u00a0 We welcome the Full Operational Capability of NATO\u2019s Rapid Air Mobility which was activated and utilised by Allies for relief flights carrying critical supplies to Allies and partners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n26.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to respond in a measured, balanced, coordinated, and timely way to Russia\u2019s growing and evolving array of conventional and nuclear-capable missiles, which is increasing in scale and complexity and which poses significant risks from all strategic directions to security and stability across the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 We will continue to implement a coherent and balanced package of political and military measures to achieve Alliance objectives, including strengthened integrated air and missile defence; advanced defensive and offensive conventional capabilities; steps to keep NATO\u2019s nuclear deterrent safe, secure, and effective; efforts to support and strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation; intelligence; and exercises.\u00a0 We have no intention to deploy land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.\n27.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, which contributes to deterrence and defence and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO's capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.\u00a0 NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.\u00a0 This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions.\n28.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO has enhanced its IAMD mission and we have taken steps to improve our IAMD forces\u2019 readiness and responsiveness in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict, strengthening our ability to ensure that all necessary measures are implemented for the security of the Alliance.\u00a0 We are taking into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats from state and non-state actors ranging from simple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles.\n29.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allies will continue to work on NATO IAMD to ensure that it remains flexible and adaptive.\u00a0 Allies will also continue to effectively train and exercise their IAMD forces.\u00a0 Allies have committed to improving NATO IAMD capabilities, including sensors, interceptors, and command and control, in particular through the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of NATO\u2019s new IAMD Centre of Excellence in Greece.\n30.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resilience is essential for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance\u2019s core tasks.\u00a0 It is a national responsibility and a collective commitment, anchored in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.\u00a0 Recognising the significant progress achieved since our Resilience Commitment at the 2016 Warsaw Summit, we have agreed today a Strengthened Resilience Commitment that sets out further steps we intend to take in the coming years.\u00a0 We will continue to take a whole-of-government approach to enhancing the resilience of our societies, and achieving the seven NATO Baseline Requirements for national resilience, through enhanced civil-military cooperation and civil preparedness; closer engagement with our populations, the private sector, and non-governmental actors; and the centres of expertise on resilience established by Allies.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience in Romania.\u00a0 NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, will maintain and enhance the security of our critical infrastructure, key industries, supply chains, and communication information networks, including 5G.\u00a0 NATO will further strengthen its own resilience, ensuring our ability to consult, decide, and act together. \u00a0We will continue to work closely with our partners and other international organisations engaged in similar efforts in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.\n31.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our nations continue to face threats and challenges from both state and non-state actors who use hybrid activities to target our political institutions, our public opinion, and the security of our citizens.\u00a0 While the primary responsibility for responding to hybrid threats rests with the targeted nation, NATO is ready, upon Council decision, to assist an Ally at any stage of a hybrid campaign being conducted against it, including by deploying a Counter Hybrid Support Team.\u00a0 In cases of hybrid warfare, the Council could decide to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as in the case of an armed attack.\u00a0 NATO and Allies will continue to prepare for, deter, and defend against hybrid threats.\u00a0 Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.\u00a0 We are enhancing our situational awareness and expanding the tools at our disposal to counter hybrid threats, including disinformation campaigns, by developing comprehensive preventive and response options.\u00a0 We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges.\n32.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent.\u00a0 This has been recently illustrated by ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions, which might have systemic effects and cause significant harm.\u00a0 To face this evolving challenge, we have today endorsed NATO\u2019s Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy, which will support NATO\u2019s three core tasks and overall deterrence and defence posture, and further enhance our resilience.\u00a0 Reaffirming NATO\u2019s defensive mandate, the Alliance is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.\u00a0 We reaffirm that a decision as to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u00a0 We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.\u00a0 We will promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict by supporting international law and voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.\u00a0 We will make greater use of NATO as a platform for political consultation among Allies, sharing concerns about malicious cyber activities, and exchanging national approaches and responses, as well as considering possible collective responses.\u00a0 If necessary, we will impose costs on those who harm us.\u00a0 Our response need not be restricted to the cyber domain.\u00a0 We will enhance our situational awareness to support NATO\u2019s decision-making.\u00a0 Resilience and the ability to detect, prevent, mitigate, and respond to vulnerabilities and intrusions is critical, as demonstrated by malicious cyber actors\u2019 exploitation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 NATO as an organisation will therefore continue to adapt and improve its cyber defences.\u00a0 Five years since the adoption of our Cyber Defence Pledge, we remain committed to uphold strong national cyber defences as a matter of priority.\u00a0 We continue to implement cyberspace as a domain of operations.\u00a0 We will enhance the effective integration of sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into collective defence and Alliance operations and missions, in the framework of strong political oversight.\u00a0 We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.\u00a0 We welcome the recent opening of the NATO Communications and Information Academy in Portugal.\n33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We recognise the growing importance of space for the security and prosperity of our nations and for NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence.\u00a0 Secure access to space services, products, and capabilities is essential for the conduct of the Alliance\u2019s operations, missions and activities.\u00a0 We will accelerate our work to deepen and expand our use of space as an operational domain, including through the NATO Space Centre in Germany and the upcoming establishment of the Space Centre of Excellence in France, which we welcome.\u00a0 We will strengthen NATO\u2019s space domain awareness and better integrate space in our activities, including training and exercises, resilience, and innovation efforts.\u00a0 Consistent with the Overarching Space Policy, NATO's approach to space will remain fully in line with international law.\u00a0 We support the international efforts to promote responsible behaviour in space.\u00a0 We consider that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance, the impact of which could threaten national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security, and stability, and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.\u00a0 Such attacks could lead to the invocation of Article 5.\u00a0 A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a case-by-case basis.\n34.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We continue to stand and act together in response to the challenging security environment.\u00a0 As it continues to evolve, the Alliance will continue to respond and adapt as necessary.\u00a0 Since the Warsaw Summit, we have established a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.\u00a0 We continue to improve our enhanced Forward Presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland through alignment with plans and by ensuring the ability of the four combat-ready battlegroups to operate with national home defence forces in an integrated manner.\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored Forward Presence on land, at sea, and in the air in the Black Sea region, and we remain committed to its full implementation.\u00a0 Our assurance measures, including exercises and various other air, land, and maritime activities, remain in place and continue to provide the fundamental baseline requirement for assurance and deterrence.\u00a0 We have increased our contributions to our tailored assurance measures for Turkey, and we remain committed to their full implementation.\u00a0 We have a range of forces, including the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which are ready to deploy on short notice to respond to any contingencies and reinforce Allies.\u00a0 The full implementation of NATO\u2019s Framework for the South, as an enduring component of NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence posture, is ongoing.\u00a0 Building on the progress achieved since 2016, including the establishment of the Hub for the South, we will continue to strengthen our capacity to deal with the threats and challenges emanating from the South, including in the Mediterranean Sea region and its approaches, by enhancing our strategic awareness, our plans, and the readiness of our forces.\u00a0 In the High North, we will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities in support of the Alliance\u2019s security interests.\u00a0 We will seek to strengthen cooperation with relevant and like-minded partners in the interests of NATO\u2019s agreed deterrence and defence objectives, in line with NATO\u2019s decisions, policies and procedures, as appropriate, and with consideration of political implications.\n35.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all aspects of the Defence Investment Pledge agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit.\u00a0 Fair burden sharing underpins the Alliance\u2019s cohesion, solidarity, credibility, and ability to fulfil our fundamental Article 3 and Article 5 commitments.\u00a0 We are, individually and collectively, committed to further improving the balance of sharing the costs and responsibilities of Alliance membership. \u00a0We have made considerable progress since the Wales Summit with seven consecutive years of real growth in non-US defence expenditure, which reinforces our shared responsibility to provide capabilities to the Alliance.\u00a0 All Allies have increased the amount they spend on defence in real terms and this trend is set to continue.\u00a0 Since 2014, European Allies and Canada will have added 260 billion US dollars by the end of this year.\u00a0 Furthermore, ten Allies are expected to spend 2% or more of GDP on defence this year.\u00a0 About two-thirds of Allies plan to reach or exceed the 2% guideline by 2024.\u00a0 Additionally, 24 Allies are spending more than 20% of their defence expenditures on major equipment, including related research and development, and, according to their national plans, 27 Allies will meet the 20% guideline by 2024.\u00a0 Our overall security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend it.\u00a0 Allies continue to make valuable force and capability contributions that benefit the security of the Euro-Atlantic area through NATO\u2019s operations, missions, and other activities, as well as through the operations and missions conducted under national authority and the authority of other organisations.\u00a0 Allies invest considerable resources in preparing their forces, capabilities, and infrastructure for Alliance activities and Allies\u2019 operations.\u00a0 In the years ahead, in line with the Defence Investment Pledge and building on the good progress to date, we affirm our commitment to continue our efforts as a matter of priority across the three pillars of cash, capabilities, and contributions.\u00a0 We must and will do more.\n36.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are investing in our military capabilities in order to meet new and enduring challenges across all operational domains.\u00a0 We continue to deliver an array of robust and sophisticated capabilities across all domains, including heavier, more high-end, technologically advanced, better-supported forces and capabilities at the required readiness.\u00a0 We will continue to improve and adapt the sustainability, deployability, and interoperability of our capabilities for a demanding strategic environment, as well as high-end operations.\u00a0 Our national capability development plans will support the full and timely implementation of the capabilities, in particular those required by the Alliance in line with the NATO Defence Planning Process.\u00a0 In light of the pace, breadth, and scale of technological developments, as we further develop our forces and capabilities, we recognise the vital importance of research and development and innovation to exploit the opportunities and to address the challenges posed by emerging and disruptive technologies.\u00a0 This will help to ensure, individually and collectively, our technological edge now and in the future.\u00a0 We continue working to address, as appropriate, existing dependencies on Russian-sourced legacy military equipment through national efforts and multinational cooperation.\u00a0 We welcome the modernisation of the NATO AWACS fleet and the progress of the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control programme, as well as the initial operations of the new Alliance Ground Surveillance Force.\u00a0 Through NATO-supported multinational cooperation projects, Allies are committed to working together to develop or acquire new capabilities in key areas such as air-to-air refuelling, training, precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.\n37.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The speed of technological change has never been higher, creating both new opportunities and risks in the security environment and to the way NATO operates.\u00a0 We are determined to preserve our technological edge, and ensure Alliance interoperability, in order to maintain the credibility of our deterrence and defence posture.\u00a0 We have recently taken important steps to that end, building on the Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) Roadmap we agreed in 2019, and have now adopted our strategy to foster and protect EDTs.\u00a0 This strategy outlines a clear approach for identifying, developing, and adopting EDTs at the speed of relevance, guided by principles of responsible use, in accordance with international law, and taking into account discussions in relevant international fora.\u00a0 Moreover, this strategy seeks to preserve our interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments by others, both now and in the future.\u00a0 Drawing on the extensive innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to maintain our technological edge.\n38.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to protect and defend our territory and our populations against attack, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. \u00a0No one should doubt NATO's resolve if the security of any of its members were to be threatened.\u00a0 Faced with a highly diverse, complex, and demanding international security environment, NATO is determined to maintain the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our populations, wherever it should arise.\n39.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Credible deterrence and defence is essential as a means to prevent conflict and war and will continue to be based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities.\u00a0 A robust deterrence and defence posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides an essential political and military transatlantic link, through an equitable and sustainable distribution of roles, responsibilities, and burdens.\u00a0 We acknowledge the increasingly challenging security environment with risks arising from changes in the posture, doctrine, and behaviour of potential adversaries and their significant investments to develop, modernise, and expand capabilities.\u00a0 NATO continues to adapt and remains steadfast in its resolve to take all necessary steps to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture remains credible, coherent, resilient, and adaptable to the security environment.\n40.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allies\u2019 goal is to continue to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defence and to contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance.\u00a0 As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.\u00a0 In response to the more challenging security environment, NATO has taken steps to ensure its nuclear deterrent capabilities remain safe, secure, and effective.\u00a0 The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of Allies.\u00a0 The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.\u00a0 These Allies\u2019 separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.\u00a0 NATO's nuclear deterrence posture also relies on United States' nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe and the capabilities and infrastructure provided by Allies concerned.\u00a0 National contributions of dual-capable aircraft to NATO's nuclear deterrence mission remain central to this effort.\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in the agreed nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve.\u00a0 Allies concerned will continue to drive forward progress on sustaining leadership focus and institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission.\u00a0 Allies will also continue to ensure greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence posture, strengthen effective strategic communications and enhance the effectiveness of NATO exercises to maintain and demonstrate a credible deterrence and reduce strategic risk.\u00a0 NATO supports efforts towards strategic risk reduction which constitute important contributions to regional and international security.\u00a0 In particular, transparency and dialogue can help avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.\n41.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.\u00a0 Given the deteriorating security environment in Europe, a credible and united nuclear Alliance is essential.\u00a0 Nuclear weapons are unique.\u00a0 The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.\u00a0 NATO reiterates that any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.\u00a0 If the fundamental security of any of its members were to be threatened, however, NATO has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve.\n42.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to continue to deliver a NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability, to pursue the Alliance's core task of collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.\u00a0 NATO BMD is purely defensive.\u00a0 The aim and political principles of NATO BMD remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.\u00a0 These principles are the indivisibility of Allies\u2019 security and NATO solidarity, equitable sharing of risks and burdens as well as reasonable challenge, taking into account the level of threat, affordability, and technical feasibility, and in accordance with the latest common threat assessments agreed by the Alliance.\u00a0 Should international efforts reduce the threats posed by ballistic missile proliferation, NATO missile defence can and will adapt accordingly.\n43.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Turkey, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.\u00a0 Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.\u00a0 We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability.\u00a0 Full Allied political control and oversight are essential, and full implementation will be ensured and monitored.\u00a0 We will continue to engage with third states on a case-by-case basis to enhance transparency, build mutual confidence, and increase ballistic missile defence effectiveness.\n44.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO BMD is not directed against Russia and will not undermine Russia's strategic deterrence.\u00a0 NATO BMD is intended to defend against potential threats emanating from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 We have explained to Russia many times that the BMD system is not capable against Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent and there is no intention to redesign this system to have such a capability in the future.\u00a0 Hence, Russian statements threatening to target Allies because of NATO BMD are unacceptable and counterproductive.\u00a0 Should Russia be ready to discuss BMD with NATO, and subject to Alliance agreement, NATO remains open to the discussion.\n45.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance\u2019s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.\u00a0 NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.\u00a0 After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.\u00a0 We regret that the conditions for achieving disarmament have not been realised since the 2018 Brussels NATO Summit.\u00a0 Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.\u00a0 We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment.\u00a0 We welcome and fully support the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to extend the New START Treaty for five years.\u00a0 NATO Allies believe the New START Treaty contributes to international stability, and Allies again express their strong support for its continued implementation and for early and active dialogue on ways to improve strategic stability.\u00a0 Allies will welcome new strategic talks between the United States and Russia on future arms control measures, taking into account all Allies\u2019 security.\u00a0 Allies will support further arms control negotiations, with the aim of improving the security of the Alliance, taking into account the prevailing international security environment.\n46.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO remains clear-eyed about the challenges Russia poses, including the qualitative and quantitative increase of Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons.\u00a0 The Alliance will be guided by experience, not least Russia\u2019s material breach of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which ultimately led to the termination of that agreement.\u00a0 NATO will continue to respond in a measured and responsible way to the significant risks posed by the Russian 9M729 missile, and other short- and intermediate-range missiles, to Allied security.\u00a0 We have agreed a balanced, coordinated, and defensive package of measures to ensure NATO's deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective, including through potential arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation contributions.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s proposal for a moratorium on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe is inconsistent with Russia\u2019s unilateral and ongoing deployment of such systems on the continent and would not prevent Russia from building up such missiles outside of its European territory; this proposal is therefore not credible and not acceptable.\u00a0 At the same time, NATO Allies remain open to meaningful arms control discussions and dialogue on reciprocal transparency and confidence-building measures that would take into account security interests of all Allies and increase security across the Alliance.\n47.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons, the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology.\u00a0 Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT in all its aspects, as an irreplaceable platform, and the strengthening of the NPT across its mutually reinforcing three pillars.\u00a0 We are committed to working towards a meaningful outcome at the upcoming Tenth Review Conference, which presents a major opportunity to contribute to the preservation, universalisation, and full implementation of the NPT.\u00a0 The Alliance reaffirms its resolve to seek a safer world for all and to take further practical steps and effective measures to create the conditions for further nuclear disarmament negotiations.\u00a0 NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, including Article VI, in an ever more effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability, and is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.\u00a0 NATO's nuclear arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT, which remains the only credible path to nuclear disarmament.\u00a0 The enduring success of the NPT cannot be taken for granted and requires sustained effort to further its achievements.\u00a0 In this spirit, we call on all NPT States Parties to work together towards a successful Tenth Review Conference.\u00a0 We reiterate our opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which is inconsistent with the Alliance\u2019s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.\u00a0 The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.\u00a0 We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.\u00a0 We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty\u2019s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament.\n48.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While NATO is not itself party to any arms control agreement, Allies will make best use of NATO as an important platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts that will support Alliance unity, political cohesion, and solidarity.\u00a0 We continue actively to address the collapse of the INF Treaty due to Russian actions, and we are committed to maintain appropriate consultations among Allies on these issues.\n49.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain deeply concerned by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), as well as their means of delivery and related materials, by states and non-state actors, which represents a growing threat to our populations, territory, and forces.\u00a0 We condemn in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria, as well as use in Iraq, Russia, Malaysia, and, for the first time since NATO\u2019s foundation on Allied territory, the United Kingdom.\u00a0 The use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, for any reason is unacceptable.\u00a0 There can be no impunity for those who use chemical weapons.\u00a0 We therefore welcome, as an important step towards accountability, the decision by the April 2021 Conference of the State Parties of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to suspend Syria\u2019s rights and privileges under the CWC.\u00a0 We are determined to uphold the CWC and the global norm against the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, and to hold those who use chemical weapons accountable for their actions, including through our joint commitment within the International Partnership Against the Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons.\u00a0 We support the full implementation of the CWC and the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in addressing WMD threats and condemn those who seek to impede its work.\u00a0 NATO remains committed to ensuring that Allies can protect their populations, forces, and territories against CBRN threats, including through reviewing NATO\u2019s Comprehensive, Strategic Level Policy for Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Defending against CBRN Threats.\u00a0 We are united in our resolve to promote the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\u00a0 We underline the need to bring the treaty into force and we support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission, including the International Data Centre and International Monitoring System.\u00a0 We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.\u00a0 In the meantime, the Alliance calls on all states to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\n50.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain committed to conventional arms control as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security.\u00a0 We are determined to preserve, strengthen, and modernise conventional arms control in Europe, based on key principles and commitments, including reciprocity, transparency, and host nation consent.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s continuing aggressive military posture, its refusal to fully comply with its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, its ongoing selective implementation of the Vienna Document, and its long-standing failure to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, continue to undermine security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 Allies call on Russia to return to full implementation of, and compliance with the letter and spirit of all of its international obligations and commitments, which is essential to rebuilding trust and confidence, military transparency and increasing predictability in the Euro-Atlantic region.\u00a0 We specifically call on Russia to be open and transparent about its no-notice snap exercises, large-scale exercises and large-scale troop movements, in accordance with its Vienna Document commitments, particularly in light of its recent unprovoked and unjustified military build-up in and around Ukraine.\u00a0 Allies underscore the importance of modernising the Vienna Document, and welcome the broad support for its comprehensive modernisation package.\u00a0 We look forward to intensified discussions in the Forum for Security Cooperation leading to consensus on an updated Vienna Document at the 2021 OSCE Ministerial.\u00a0 To maintain the contributions of the Treaty on Open Skies to the security of all State Parties, it is essential that all State Parties fully implement its provisions.\u00a0 We will continue to actively support ongoing discussions at the OSCE, including the Structured Dialogue.\u00a0 We call on Russia to engage constructively on all these efforts.\n51.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reiterate the Alliance\u2019s full support to the goal of the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea, in accordance with relevant UNSCRs.\u00a0 We call on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to engage in meaningful negotiations with the United States towards achieving this goal.\u00a0 We urge the DPRK to fully implement its international obligations; to eliminate its nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare capabilities and ballistic missiles; to return to the NPT and its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and to abandon all related programmes.\u00a0 We call on nations to fully implement existing UN sanctions.\n52.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that Iran will never develop a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 We welcome the substantive discussions between Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) participants, and separately with the United States, to accomplish a mutual return to compliance with the JCPoA by the United States and Iran.\u00a0 We support the goal of restoring the non-proliferation benefits of the JCPoA and of ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\u00a0 It is vital that Iran preserves the space for these discussions by avoiding any further escalation.\u00a0 We strongly support the IAEA in its crucial monitoring and verification work to help ensure Iran\u2019s compliance with the NPT-related safeguards obligations, as well as its other commitments.\u00a0 A restored and fully implemented JCPoA could also pave the way to further address regional and security concerns, including in support of the non-proliferation regime.\u00a0 We condemn Iran\u2019s support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, including through financing, training, and the proliferation of missile technology and weapons.\u00a0 We call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231, refrain from destabilising actions, and play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace.\nSyria retains an inventory of short-range ballistic missiles whose range covers parts of NATO\u2019s territory and some of our partners\u2019 territories.\u00a0 Syria has used these missiles extensively against its own population.\u00a0 We remain vigilant over missile launches from Syria which could again hit or target Turkey.\u00a0 We continue to monitor and assess the ballistic missile threat from Syria.\nThe increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the vicinity of the south-eastern border of the Alliance has been, and remains a driver in NATO\u2019s development and deployment of a ballistic missile defence system, which is configured to counter threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area.\n53.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The conflict in Syria has entered its eleventh year and continues to have significant consequences on the stability of the region and the security of NATO\u2019s south-eastern border.\u00a0 We remain concerned and vigilant over its ramifications.\u00a0 We reiterate our determination to defend NATO territory and borders against any threats and to address challenges emanating from Syria.\u00a0 The presidential elections held on 26 May 2021 by the Syrian regime cannot be considered as free and fair and do not contribute to the efforts to achieve a political solution.\u00a0 We underline that stability and security cannot be reinstated in Syria without a genuine political process in line with UNSCR 2254.\u00a0 We call for a nationwide ceasefire and the reauthorisation and expansion of the UN cross-border humanitarian assistance for a period of at least 12\u00a0months in order to meet the needs of the Syrian people.\u00a0 We reiterate our appreciation to our Ally Turkey for hosting millions of Syrian refugees.\n54.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allies remain deeply concerned about developments in Belarus since August 2020.\u00a0 The policies and actions of Belarus have implications for regional stability and have violated the principles which underpin our partnership.\u00a0 NATO will remain vigilant of and monitor the implications for the security of the Alliance.\u00a0 The\u00a0unacceptable diversion of a civilian aircraft in May 2021 and the subsequent arrest of a journalist and his partner travelling on board endangered the safety of civilians and was a grave affront to political dissent and freedom of the press.\u00a0 We support the independent investigations, including by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\u00a0 We support measures taken by Allies individually and collectively in response to this incident.\u00a0 We call on Belarus to abide by international law, respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including those belonging to the Union of Poles in Belarus.\u00a0 A democratic, sovereign, and stable Belarus is in all of our interests.\u00a0 Allies stand ready for a mutually beneficial NATO-Belarus partnership, taking into account political and security conditions.\u00a0 We will follow the scale, scope, and aftermath of the Zapad-2021 exercise, and continue to call on Russia and Belarus to act in a predictable, transparent way in compliance with their international obligations and OSCE commitments.\n55.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\u00a0 We are concerned by those coercive policies which stand in contrast to the fundamental values enshrined in the Washington Treaty.\u00a0 China is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad.\u00a0 It is opaque in implementing its military modernisation and its publicly declared military-civil fusion strategy.\u00a0 It is also cooperating militarily with Russia, including through participation in Russian exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 We remain concerned with China\u2019s frequent lack of transparency and use of disinformation.\u00a0 We call on China to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains, in keeping with its role as a major power.\n56.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO maintains a constructive dialogue with China where possible.\u00a0 Based on our interests, we welcome opportunities to engage with China on areas of relevance to the Alliance and on common challenges such as climate change.\u00a0 There is value in information exchange on respective policies and activities, to enhance awareness and discuss potential disagreements.\u00a0 Allies urge China to engage meaningfully in dialogue, confidence-building, and transparency measures regarding its nuclear capabilities and doctrine.\u00a0 Reciprocal transparency and understanding would benefit both NATO and China.\n57.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are working together as an Alliance and with like-minded partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect critical infrastructure, strengthen resilience, maintain our technological edge, and address these challenges to the rules-based international order.\n58.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our times.\u00a0 It is a threat multiplier that impacts Allied security, both in the Euro-Atlantic area and in the Alliance\u2019s broader neighbourhood.\u00a0 Climate change puts our resilience and civil preparedness to the test, affects our planning and the resilience of our military installations and critical infrastructure, and may create harsher conditions for our operations.\u00a0 Today we have endorsed an Action Plan to implement our NATO Agenda on Climate Change and Security, which increases our awareness, adaptation, mitigation, and outreach efforts, while ensuring a credible deterrence and defence posture and upholding the priorities of the safety of military personnel and operational and cost effectiveness.\u00a0 To increase awareness, NATO will conduct annual assessments of the impact of climate change on its strategic environment as well as on missions and operations.\u00a0 To adapt to climate change, NATO will incorporate climate change considerations into its full spectrum of work, ranging from defence planning and capability development to civil preparedness and exercises.\u00a0 To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, drawing on best practices of Allies, and taking into account their different national circumstances, NATO will develop a mapping methodology to help Allies measure greenhouse gas emissions from military activities and installations, which could contribute to formulating voluntary goals to reduce such emissions.\u00a0 NATO will also strengthen exchanges with partner countries as well as with international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security issues.\n59.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Energy security plays an important role in our common security.\u00a0 A stable and reliable energy supply, the diversification of routes, suppliers, and energy resources, including the integration of sustainable energy sources, and the interconnectivity of energy networks, are all of critical importance and increase our resilience against political and economic pressure.\u00a0 It is essential to ensure that the members of the Alliance are not vulnerable to political or coercive manipulation of energy, which constitutes a potential threat.\u00a0 Allies will therefore continue to seek further diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions.\u00a0 While these issues are primarily the responsibility of national authorities, energy developments can have significant political and security implications for Allies and also affect our partners.\u00a0 Consequently, we will continue to enhance our strategic awareness, including through regular Allied consultations and intelligence sharing, and will strengthen our links with relevant international organisations.\u00a0 We will further develop NATO\u2019s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical infrastructure, including against malicious hybrid and cyber activity.\u00a0 We will ensure reliable energy supplies to our military forces.\n60.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO has long recognised the importance of Human Security, which focuses on risks and threats to populations in conflict or crisis areas and how to mitigate and respond to them.\u00a0 Taking a Human Security approach is a reflection of our values and makes us more operationally effective.\u00a0 We are committed to ensuring that all efforts are made to avoid, minimise, and mitigate any potential negative effects on civilians arising from our missions or activities, as underscored in our Policy for the Protection of Civilians.\u00a0 Today, we endorse NATO\u2019s new Policy on Preventing and Responding to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, a landmark demonstration of our commitment to addressing such violence, which inflicts long-term stigma and trauma on individuals and families, contributes to their marginalisation, destroys the social fabric of communities, triggers displacement, fuels armed actors\u2019 activities, fosters prolonged conflict and instability, and is an impediment to sustainable peace and reconciliation.\u00a0 We are updating our policy on combating trafficking in human beings.\u00a0 Our ongoing work on Human Security also includes Children and Armed Conflict and Cultural Property Protection.\u00a0 NATO will continue to work with its partners, international organisations, and civil society to further our Human Security agenda, which includes robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in support of lasting peace and security and our populations\u2019 common defence.\n61.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recognising the critical importance of women\u2019s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, as well as the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including conflict-related sexual violence, we are committed to fully implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council.\u00a0 NATO\u2019s Policy and Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security better prepare the Alliance to address the challenges of today and tomorrow.\u00a0 NATO\u2019s Policy on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, agreed in 2019, reinforces our commitment to hold ourselves to the highest standards of behaviour, in keeping with our values.\u00a0 Working together with partners, international organisations, and civil society, we will consistently continue to implement our policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, and activities.\n62.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We remain committed to NATO\u2019s Building Integrity Policy and Programme.\u00a0 Corruption and poor governance undermine democracy, the rule of law, and economic development, thus constituting challenges to our security.\u00a0 Implementing measures to improve integrity building, to fight against corruption, and to foster good governance is of continued importance for NATO, Allies, and partners alike.\n63.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO\u2019s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.\u00a0 The success of NATO\u2019s partnerships is demonstrated by their strategic contribution to Alliance and international security.\u00a0 They play an important role in supporting NATO\u2019s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.\u00a0 They are central to advancing NATO\u2019s cooperative security agenda, helping to shape our security environment, and contributing to stability in the Euro-Atlantic area, and to the pursuit of NATO\u2019s political and military objectives.\u00a0 We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent, and more effective.\u00a0 The Alliance\u2019s partner relationships are also based on reciprocity, mutual benefit and mutual respect.\u00a0 We will strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with our partners.\u00a0 We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO\u2019s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.\u00a0 We recognise their sacrifices for Euro-Atlantic and international security over the years.\u00a0 We will continue to improve interoperability, in particular with our Enhanced Opportunities Partners.\u00a0 Recognising that conflict and instability in NATO\u2019s neighbourhood directly undermine Allied security, we will continue to intensify NATO\u2019s assistance and capacity building support to our partners.\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to expand political dialogue and practical cooperation with any nation that shares the Alliance\u2019s values and interest in international peace and security and will further develop our partnerships so that they continue to meet the interests of both Allies and partners.\u00a0 In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO's own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations.\n64.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.\u00a0 The NATO-EU strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 NATO recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence.\u00a0 The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.\u00a0 Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.\u00a0 Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU's efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.\u00a0 For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies\u2019 fullest involvement in these efforts is essential.\u00a0 We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.\u00a0 We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.\u00a0 We will continue to further strengthen our strategic partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations\u2019 different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations.\n65.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NATO-EU cooperation has reached unprecedented levels, with tangible results in countering hybrid and cyber threats, strategic communication, operational cooperation including maritime issues, military mobility, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, exercises, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.\u00a0 Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance this cooperation.\u00a0 We will continue to develop and deepen our cooperation by fully implementing the common set of 74 proposals, which contribute to the coherence and complementarity of our efforts.\u00a0 The current strategic environment and the COVID pandemic underscore the importance of NATO-EU cooperation in the face of current and evolving security challenges, in particular in addressing resilience issues, emerging and disruptive technologies, the security implications of climate change, disinformation, and the growing geostrategic competition.\u00a0 The ongoing distinct strategic processes within NATO and the EU offer a unique opportunity to intensify further our consultations and cooperation to enhance the security of our citizens and promote peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond, while reaffirming that NATO remains the transatlantic framework for strong collective defence and the essential forum for security consultations and decisions among Allies.\u00a0 We value the Secretary General\u2019s continued close cooperation with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the High Representative, on all aspects of the NATO-EU strategic partnership.\n66.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reaffirm our commitment to NATO\u2019s Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, which has been a historic success.\u00a0 North Macedonia\u2019s accession last year is yet another tangible demonstration of this commitment.\u00a0 Successive rounds of enlargement have strengthened Euro-Atlantic security by helping to spread and consolidate the rule of law and democratic institutions and practices across the European continent, and have respected the right of all states to seek their own security arrangements, as enshrined in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe.\u00a0 NATO\u2019s door remains open to all European democracies which share the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, which are in a position to further the principles of the Treaty, and whose inclusion can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.\u00a0 Decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself; no third party has a say in that process.\u00a0 We remain committed to the integration of those countries that aspire to join the Alliance, judging each on its own merits.\u00a0 We encourage them to continue to implement the necessary reforms and decisions to prepare for membership.\u00a0 We will continue to offer support to their efforts and look to them to take the steps necessary to advance their aspirations.\n67.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allies strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements, encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to avoid divisive rhetoric.\u00a0 We commend Bosnia and Herzegovina, an aspirant country, for its contributions to NATO-led operations.\u00a0 We are committed to maintaining strong political dialogue with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and offer our continued support to the implementation of all reform efforts, including through NATO HQ Sarajevo.\u00a0 We encourage the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take full advantage of the breadth of NATO cooperative security and partnership tools.\u00a0 Allies welcome the work of the Commission for Cooperation with NATO.\u00a0 Allies urge political leaders to work constructively and to demonstrate political will for the benefit of all in Bosnia and Herzegovina in advancing Euro-Atlantic aspirations by implementing the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, including through the country\u2019s Reform Programme with NATO, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership.\n68.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Georgia\u2019s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00a0 As an Enhanced Opportunities Partner, Georgia is cooperating closely with the Alliance across a wide range of issues.\u00a0 We highly appreciate Georgia\u2019s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00a0 We welcome the recent political agreement on the Way Ahead for Georgia and encourage its full implementation by all sides.\u00a0 This agreement paves the way for the important reforms which will help Georgia, an aspirant country, progress in its preparations towards membership.\u00a0 We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme in deepening political dialogue and cooperation.\u00a0 We commend the significant progress on reforms which Georgia has made and must continue to make, and which have helped Georgia strengthen its defence capabilities and interoperability with the Alliance.\u00a0 Georgia\u2019s relationship with the Alliance contains all the practical tools to prepare for eventual membership.\u00a0 We are working closely with Georgia on security in the Black Sea region, in response to Russia\u2019s increasingly destabilising activities, and welcome the steps taken to implement the refreshed Substantial NATO-Georgia Package.\u00a0 We stand ready to enhance our support to Georgia, including in building resilience against hybrid threats, in training and exercises, and in secure communications.\u00a0 We look forward to the next NATO-Georgia exercise in 2022.\n69.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.\u00a0 We stand firm in our support for Ukraine\u2019s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.\u00a0 The Annual National Programmes under the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) remain the mechanism by which Ukraine takes forward the reforms pertaining to its aspiration for NATO membership.\u00a0 Ukraine should make full use of all instruments available under the NUC to reach its objective of implementing NATO principles and standards.\u00a0 The success of wide-ranging, sustainable, and irreversible reforms, including combating corruption, promoting an inclusive political process, and decentralisation reform, based on democratic values, respect for human rights, minorities, and the rule of law, will be crucial in laying the groundwork for a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine.\u00a0 Further reforms in the security sector, including the reform of the Security Services of Ukraine, are particularly important.\u00a0 We welcome significant reforms already made by Ukraine and strongly encourage further progress in line with Ukraine\u2019s international obligations and commitments.\u00a0 We will continue to provide practical support to reform in the security and defence sector, including through the Comprehensive Assistance Package.\u00a0 We will also continue to support Ukraine\u2019s efforts to strengthen its resilience against hybrid threats, including through intensifying activities under the NATO-Ukraine Platform on Countering Hybrid Warfare.\u00a0 We welcome the cooperation between NATO and Ukraine with regard to security in the Black Sea region.\u00a0 The Enhanced Opportunities Partner status granted last year provides further impetus to our already ambitious cooperation and will promote greater interoperability, with the option of more joint exercises, training, and enhanced situational awareness.\u00a0 Military cooperation and capacity building initiatives between Allies and Ukraine, including the Lithuanian-Polish-Ukrainian Brigade, further reinforce this effort.\u00a0 We highly value Ukraine\u2019s significant contributions to Allied operations, the NATO Response Force, and NATO exercises.\n70.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO, as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.\u00a0 NATO remains strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans and to supporting the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of the countries in the region.\u00a0 We will intensify our efforts in the region and enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reform

The gap between the world\u2019s poorest and wealthiest has widened in recent decades, with the Covid-19 pandemic unmasking and amplifying economic inequality in society as well as between nations [1].\nThe negative effects of economic inequality have been widely documented. There is evidence, for example, that highly unequal societies are characterized by high levels of infant mortality, limited access to education, poor health care provision, and reduced life expectancy [2]. Research has demonstrated that economic inequality has negative consequences for people\u2019s health and well-being [3\u20135]. Also, it has been shown that economic inequality reduces trust and social capital, whereas it increases violence and social unrest [6].\nThe present research aims at examining the psychological factors and processes that help to maintain versus reduce economic inequality. Specifically, this research aims at examining whether and how mindfulness, or moment-by-moment awareness, relates with citizens\u2019 (a) tax evasion intentions (as an instance of inequality-enhancing behavior) and (b) support for progressive taxation (as an instance of inequality-reducing behavior). Starting from the assumption and empirical evidence that mindfulness promotes prosocial behavior such as empathy, helping behavior, and ethical decision making [7,8], we investigated whether and how it relates with citizens\u2019 responsiveness to tax laws. This is relevant for both policies and research as it is a key issue in the study of economic inequality, both in terms of socioeconomic development and for public welfare and well-being [9,10].\nThe paper is organized as follows: The next section presents the construct of mindfulness and the theoretical framework for studying its role in the context of taxation and, more generally, economic inequality. This is followed by discussion of the motivational paths through which mindfulness may be linked to tax evasion intentions and support for tax progressivity, divided into Studies 1 and 2. The final sections summarize and conclude the paper.\nAccording to Brown and Ryan (2003) [12], mindfulness refers to people\u2019s tendency to self-regulate their attention and to be aware of internal and external stimuli, accepting them in a nonjudgmental way. Mindfulness can be reached via specific training aimed at improving people\u2019s ability to \u201cstay in touch\u201d with whatever they are experiencing moment by moment [11]. Alternatively, and as in the present research, mindfulness can be considered as a dispositional mental trait that can be measured by specific self-report scales [12,13].\nOngoing research increasingly supports the notion that individual differences in trait mindfulness positively relate with prosocial [14], pro-environmental [15], and pro-organizational [16,17] behaviors. People high in trait mindfulness were found to be more empathic and concerned with others\u2019 well-being [7] and more willing to act ethically, to value upholding ethical standards, and to make ethical decisions [8]. Helm and Subramaiam (2019) found that mindfulness favors sustainable consumption behavior through decreased adoption of materialistic values [18,19]. There is also evidence that mindfulness promotes helping behavior [7,20] and prevents ostracism [21]. In addition, and of present relevance, Panno and colleagues (2018) reported that mindfulness leads people to behave pro-environmentally by reducing their adherence to social dominance orientation (SDO), the people\u2019s tendency to support hierarchical intergroup relationships [22,23]. These authors, employing undergraduate students and meditation practitioners versus nonpractitioners, found that mindful people were less likely to approve hierarchical societal relationships (i.e., SDO) and then, they were more willing to engage in pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors [22].\nIn the present study, we relied on the aforementioned research on mindfulness and proposed that mindfulness may be related to citizens\u2019 attitudes and behavioral tendencies toward taxes and the tax system. Specifically, in line with the findings of Panno et al. (2018) [22], we examined whether (a) being mindful may relate with citizens\u2019 tax evasion intentions, (b) mindfulness relates to support for a progressive tax system, and (c) these relations are mediated through SDO.\nTax evasion is one of the major public policy problems, with negative consequences on compliant taxpayers, infrastructure spending, health care and services, and the entire safety net. Revenue losses from evasion are particularly critical for the maintenance of adequate social services and sustainable economies [24,25]. Tax evasion distorts the principle of perfect market resource allocation [26]; it weakens the cardinal virtue of social justice and, consequently, poses a fundamental threat to the reduction of economic inequality [27,28]. Importantly, past research on tax compliance has found that tax evasion is associated with a pro-self (vs. pro-social) orientation. Because of their tendency to maximize one\u2019s individual gains, pro-self (vs. pro-social) oriented citizens are more likely to evade taxes, thereby supporting economic inequality in favor of their privileged position [29].\nBased on existing literature on pro-social effects of mindfulness [12], the first goal of the present research is to investigate whether and how mindfulness relates with citizens\u2019 intentions to pay or evade taxes. More specifically, following Panno and colleagues (2018) [22], we proposed that the relation between mindfulness and tax evasion may be explained by SDO. According to these authors, indeed, mindful people are less inclined to adhere to SDO due to their tendency to act ethically and to display empathy and other-oriented behaviors. Consequently, lower SDO is negatively associated with inequality-related outcomes [30\u201332]. This is because SDO reflects a preference for antagonism and the supremacy of powerful societal members over weaker ones; people with an elevated SDO endorse a hierarchical relationship between groups and a stratified vision of society [33,34]. From this starting point, we predicted that mindfulness should negatively relate with citizens\u2019 adherence to SDO and thus with their tax evasion intentions [Hypothesis 1 (H1)]. We tested this prediction in Study 1.\nTo redress economic inequality, several political decisions must be made regarding how economic resources should be extracted and allocated, such as implementing progressive taxation [35]. Progressive taxation (i.e., the degree to which the tax rate is higher for the high-income earners than for the low-income earners) is a policy tool for changing the taxation system so that income and wealth are redistributed to the less fortunate [36] and economic inequality is reduced [37]. As such, support for a progressive tax system is associated with a pro-social (vs. pro-self) orientation. Indeed, pro-social (vs. pro-self) oriented individuals are concerned with others\u2019 gains and losses and they tend to maximize joint and equal outcomes [29,38].\nThe second goal of the present research is to investigate whether and how mindfulness relates with citizens\u2019 decision on whether to support or reject tax progressivity. More specifically, building on the role of SDO, we wanted to elaborate further on the motivational paths for how mindfulness may relate to citizens\u2019 attitudes toward the tax system. To more solidly ground mindfulness in research on taxation and economic inequality, it is important to study these paths.\nAccordingly, Study 2 built on the dual-process motivational model (DPM; [39]), which posits that inequality-related outcomes are linked with two distinct ideological attitudes which have different motivational bases: SDO and right-wing authoritarianism. As previously explained, SDO captures preference for hierarchical intergroup relationships [23]. In accordance with Duckitt et al. (2002) [39], SDO depends upon a competitive-jungle social worldview, a relatively stable belief that the social world is a competitive jungle in which the advantaged win and the disadvantaged lose [40,41]. Instead, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) reflects a preference for the maintenance of in-group norms and values as well as existing traditions and conventions [42]. People espousing elevated right-wing authoritarianism support coercive social control, obedience, and respect for authorities [42]. As a consequence, RWA is related with hierarchy and inequality, but from an intragroup perspective, rather than an intergroup perspective (as is the case for SDO). In Duckitt\u2019s model, RWA stems from a dangerous-world social worldview, a relatively stable belief that the social world is a dangerous and unpredictable place in which norms and values are perceived to be under threat [40,41], and\u2014by the same token\u2014norms, values, and personal honesty are perceived as the pillars of a cherished status quo [43]. Unlike SDO, then, RWA does not align strongly with ruthlessness in competing for resources and privilege.\nHence, in the present research, we assume that SDO positively relates to people\u2019s tendency to compete with other societal members, driven by a stratified vision of society in which the powerful dominate over the weaker. Also, because of its focus on hierarchical intergroup relationships, SDO should be more likely to relate with mindfulness in comparison to RWA, which focuses on the maintenance of norms and values. Because of its focus on intergroup hierarchical relationships in the competition for status and resources, we proposed here that the relation between mindfulness and tax-related criteria would more decisively follow the competitive jungle\u2013social dominance path, compared with the dangerous world\u2013RWA path. Stated formally, mindfulness should negatively relate with citizens\u2019 competitive-jungle beliefs and then their SDO. In turn, lower SDO should positively relate with their support for tax progressivity [Hypothesis 2 (H2)]. People\u2019s support for tax progressivity should be more strongly explained by this motivational path of competitive jungle\u2013social dominance compared to the motivational path of RWA, which is based on dangerous-world beliefs. Put differently, the dangerous world\u2013RWA path should be less central in explaining motivation to support tax progressivity in respect to the competitive jungle\u2013social dominance path [Hypothesis 2a (H2a)]. In the motivational path of competitive jungle\u2013social dominance, indeed, emphasis is put on power asymmetry and competition between individuals, which should strongly refrain individuals from supporting income and wealth redistribution through progressive taxation. Conversely, in the motivational path of dangerous world\u2013authoritarianism, emphasis in put on personal values related to honesty as well as on unchanging tradition, which should be less associated with individuals\u2019 decision to support or reject tax progressivity. Therefore, we expect that individuals\u2019 support for progressive taxation should be mainly attributable to the motivational path of SDO and, to a lesser extent, to that of RWA.\nTaken together, Studies 1 and 2 extend the literature on the pro-social effects of mindfulness [12] and deepen our knowledge about motivational paths underlying tax evasion intentions (as an instance of inequality-enhancing behavior) and support for progressive taxation (as an instance of inequality-reducing behavior). We describe each study in detail below.\nStudy 1 aimed to investigate the association between mindfulness and tax evasion intentions through SDO. Based on theory and evidence reviewed above [22], we expected that mindfulness would be negatively related with SDO and, consequently, would be linked with lower tax evasion intentions [Hypothesis 1 (H1)].\nA total of 1,175 people living in Italy were contacted online and participated in the study on a voluntary basis. The sample consisted of 402 men (34.2%) and 773 women (65.8%), aged 14\u201389 years (M = 27.39, SD = 13.17). The educational level of participants varied from secondary school to PhD as follows: 10.3% secondary school, 66.5% high school, 4.2% bachelor\u2019s degree, 18% master\u2019s degree, and 1.0% PhD. Regarding political orientation, 29.4% of the sample classified themselves as left wing, 32.3% as center left, 21.1% as center, 14.8% as center right, and 8.3% as right wing. Anonymity was assured and written informed consent was obtained. Ethical approval was received by the ethics committee of the Department of Social and Developmental Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome.\nParticipants first completed the 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; [12]), which assesses individual differences in receptive attention to and awareness of ongoing internal and external experiences. Examples of items are \u201cI find it difficult to stay focused on what\u2019s happening in the present\u201d [reverse coded] and \u201cI do jobs or tasks automatically, without being aware of what I\u2019m doing\u201d [reverse coded]. Ratings were made on 6-point scales (anchors: 1 = almost never; 6 = almost always). A composite mindfulness score was computed by averaging responses across items (\u03b1 = .84); high values indicate people to be intrinsically high in mindfulness.\nThen, we asked participants to complete the 16-item SDO scale [23], designed to tap individual differences in SDO. Examples of items are: \u201cSome groups of people are simply inferior to other groups\u201d and \u201cInferior groups should stay in their place.\u201d Ratings were made on 7-point scales, where 1 = completely disagree and 7 = completely agree. A composite SDO score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .78); high values indicate higher SDO.\nNext, participants completed the Tax Evasion Subscale (TE) of the Tax Compliance Inventory (TAX-I; [44]). This subscale consists of eight items, designed to measure intentions to evade taxes. Examples of items are: \u201cYou could declare your car as a company car, although your use of it is only 30% for business purposes, and at least 50% business use is required for it to be assessed as a company car. How likely is it that you would declare your car as a company car?\u201d and \u201cYou could enter private journeys as company journeys in your driver\u2019s logbook. How likely is it that you would enter private journeys as company ones?\u201d. Ratings were made on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 = completely unlikely to 7 = completely likely. A composite tax evasion intentions score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .91); high values indicate higher intentions to evade taxes.\nCorrelations among variables are displayed in Table 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253627.t001\nWe expected mindfulness to negatively relate with SDO and, consequently, with tax evasion intentions (H1). We tested our hypothesis by conducting a mediation analysis, using Hayes\u2019s (2013) PROCESS macro (Model 4) with 5,000 bootstrap samples and 95% confidence intervals [45]. In the model, mindfulness was the independent variable (X), SDO was the mediator (M), and tax evasion intentions was the dependent variable (Y). The results of the mediation analysis are illustrated in Fig 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253627.g001\nMindfulness was negatively associated with SDO, \u03b2 = -.13, SE = .03, t = -4.38, p < .001, 95% CI [-.1837, -.0700], meaning that mindful people were less characterized by SDO. Also, SDO was positively associated with tax evasion intentions, \u03b2 = .20, SE = .03, t = 7.20, p < .001, 95% CI [.1487, .2600], meaning that people who possessed high levels of SDO were more inclined to evade taxes. Furthermore, mindfulness negatively related with tax evasion intentions, \u03b2 = -.15, SE = .03, t = -5.22, p < .001, 95% CI [-.2040, -.0926], indicating that as mindfulness increased, people were less inclined to evade taxes.\nImportantly, the indirect relation between mindfulness and tax evasion intentions was negative and significant, \u03b2 = -.02, SE = .007, 95% CI [-.0422, -.0122]. Results of Study 1 showed that mindfulness related with tax evasion intentions directly as well as indirectly through lower levels of SDO. Although conventionally small, this indirect relation provided evidence for a partial mediation model [46], lending support for H1.\nStudy 2 aimed at extending Study 1 in two ways. First, we shifted our focus on the extent to which people supported (or rejected) a progressive system of taxation. Second, building on Duckitt\u2019s (2002) [39] dual-process model, we investigated whether the positive relation between mindfulness and support for progressive taxation could be primarily attributable to the motivational path of competitive-jungle beliefs\u2013SDO or, instead, to the motivational path of dangerous-world beliefs\u2013RWA. Given mindfulness\u2019s emphasis on pro-sociality [12], we see mindfulness as more closely aligned with the SDO path, which places emphasis on unrestrained pursuit of hierarchy-enhancing pro-self behaviors, compared to the RWA path, which places emphasis on intolerance for deviations, but also to rule abidance, restraint, and honesty [43]. More specifically, because mindfulness promotes cultivation of empathy and ethical decision making [20], we expected that mindfulness would positively relate with support for a progressive taxation through lower competitive-jungle beliefs and then, SDO [Hypothesis 2 (H2)]. On the contrary, we expected a weaker pathway through dangerous-world beliefs and RWA [Hypothesis 2a (H2a)].\nParticipants were contacted online and participated in the study on a voluntary basis. In total, we recruited 722 people living in Italy. Of these, 240 were men (33.2%) and 482 were women (66.8%), aged 14\u201373 years (M = 27.18, SD = 13.23). The educational level of participants varied as follows: 0.4% primary school, 7.8% secondary school, 76.2% high school, 6.6% bachelor\u2019s degree, 5.5% master\u2019s degree, and 3.5% PhD. Regarding political orientation, 28.5% of participants classified themselves as left wing, 30.2% as center left, 19.1% as center, 15.4% center right, and 6.8% right wing. Anonymity was assured and written informed consent was obtained. Ethical approval was received by the ethics committee of the Department of Social and Developmental Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome.\nParticipants first completed the 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (a = .82), as in Study 1.\nNext, participants completed the 10-item Competitive-Jungle Beliefs Scale (CJB) developed by Duckitt et al. (2002) [39] to measure individual differences in perceptions that the social world is a competitive jungle in which the powerful win over the weak. Examples of items are: \u201cWinning is not the first thing; it\u2019s the only thing\u201d and \u201cYou know that most people are out to \u2018screw\u2019 you, so you have to get them first when you get the chance.\u201d Ratings were made on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree. A composite competitive-jungle beliefs score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .88); high values indicate higher competitive-jungle beliefs.\nParticipants also completed the 10-item Dangerous-World Beliefs Scale (DWB) developed by Duckitt et al. (2002) [39] to measure individual differences in perceptions that the social world is a dangerous place in which in-groups\u2019 norms and values are seriously threatened. Examples of items are: \u201cThere are many dangerous people in our society who will attack someone out of pure meanness, for no reason at all\u201d and \u201cEvery day society becomes more lawless and bestial, and a person\u2019s chances of being robbed, assaulted, and even murdered go up and up.\u201d Ratings were made on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree. A composite dangerous-world beliefs score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .79); high values indicate higher dangerous-world beliefs.\nSubsequently, we asked participants to complete the 8-item short version of the SDO Scale (a = .90) used in Study 1.\nFurthermore, we asked participants to complete the 10-item RWA Scale [42], which assesses individual differences in RWA. Examples of items are: \u201cWhat our country really needs is a strong determined leader who will crush evil and take us back to our true path\u201d and \u201cThe facts on crime, sexual immorality, and the recent public disorders all show we have to crack down harder on deviant groups and troublemakers, if we are going to save our moral standards and preserve law and order.\u201d Ratings were made on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree. A composite RWA score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .85); high values indicate higher RWA.\nFinally, we measured participants\u2019 support for a progressive tax system through the 5-item Preference for a Progressive Tax System Scale (TP; [47]). Examples of items are: \u201cThe only fair way is to collect more tax from rich people\u201d and \u201cTax rates ought to be increased moving from the low-income group to the high one.\u201d Ratings were made on 7-point scales, ranging from 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree. A composite support for tax progressivity score was computed by averaging responses (\u03b1 = .84); high values indicate stronger support for a progressive tax system.\nCorrelations among measures are reported in Table 2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253627.t002\nWe expected mindfulness to be negatively related with competitive-jungle beliefs and then, SDO. In turn, a lower SDO would be positively associated with support for a progressive tax system (H2). We also expected a weaker pathway from mindfulness through dangerous-world beliefs and RWA to relate with support for a progressive tax system (H2a). In the model, mindfulness (i.e., the independent variable X) impacted on both competitive-jungle beliefs and dangerous-world beliefs (i.e., the mediators M1), which impacted on the two ideological attitudes, SDO and RWA, respectively (i.e., the mediators M2). Both SDO and RWA, in turn, impacted on support for a progressive tax system (i.e., the dependent variable Y). We tested such a model using Lavaan [48], an R package for Structural Equation Modelling, by means of the RStudio graphical interface [49]. Results of the path analysis model with sequential mediators are summarized in Fig 2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253627.g002\nThe model showed good fit: \u03c72 (5) = 14.744, p = .01, with fit indices that met the desired benchmarks: RMSEA = .055, 95% CI [.024, .089]; CFI = .99. Mindfulness related significantly, and negatively, with competitive-jungle beliefs, \u03b2 = -.24, SE = .04, z = -6.79, p < .001, 95% CI [-.3115, -.1719], meaning that mindful people were less likely to believe that the social world is a competitive place in which only those who have power can \u201csurvive\u201d and win. Instead, mindfulness was not significantly related with dangerous-world beliefs, \u03b2 = -.03, SE = .03, z = -1.08, p = .28, 95% CI [-.1043, .0300]. Note that this latter CI did not overlap with the one for the mindfulness\u2013competitive jungle link. Consistent with the dual-process model\u2019s predictions [39], competitive-jungle beliefs related significantly, and positively, with SDO, \u03b2 = .62, SE = .02, z = 22.52, p < .001, 95% CI [.5724, .6815]. As is often found, a smaller positive relationship was found between competitive-jungle beliefs and RWA, \u03b2 = .31, SE = .03, z = 9.19, p < .001, 95% CI [.2514, .3875], showing that people who endorsed competitive-jungle beliefs were also likely to be higher in RWA. Dangerous-world beliefs related significantly, and positively, with RWA, \u03b2 = .29, SE = .03, z = 9.34, p < .001, 95% CI [.2294, .3511]. A much smaller and negative relationship was found between dangerous-world beliefs and SDO, \u03b2 = -.06, SE = .02, z = -2.11, p = .03, 95% CI [-.1158, -.0044], showing that people who possessed dangerous-world beliefs were less likely to endorse SDO\u2014attesting to the different processes that make RWA and SDO distinct, although related. SDO related negatively with support for progressive taxation, \u03b2 = -.30, SE = .04, z = -7.39, p < .001, 95% CI [-.3819, -.2219]; that is, people with greater SDO were less supportive of a progressive tax system. Instead, RWA was practically unrelated with support for a progressive tax system, \u03b2 = -.04, SE = .04, z = -1.04, p = .29, 95% CI [-.1215, .0367]. It should be noticed that the CI for this latter coefficient was well outside the CI for the regression of support for a progressive tax system on SDO, lending support to H2a.\nImportantly, the positive indirect relation between mindfulness and support for a progressive tax system through competitive-jungle beliefs and then, SDO, was significant, although small, \u03b2 = .04, SE = .009, z = 4.93, p < .001, 95% CI [.0275, .0639]. Conversely, mindfulness did not significantly relate with support for a progressive taxation through dangerous-world beliefs and then, RWA, \u03b2 = .0004, SE = .0006, z = 0.74, p = .45, 95% CI [-.0007, .0016]. As predicted by H2, Study 2 suggested thus that the positive relation between mindfulness and support for a progressive tax system is primarily attributable to the motivational path of SDO, which follows competitive-jungle beliefs. This competitive\u2013dominance motivational path, compared to the path pertaining to a threat\u2013control motivation (i.e., DWB and RWA), was found to be more strongly associated with support for progressive taxation, \u03b2diff = .04, SE = .009, z = 4.79, p < .001, 95% CI [.0270, .0640]. This is consistent with the notion that the relation between mindfulness and support for tax progressivity was channeled by competitive-jungle beliefs and then, SDO, but significantly less by dangerous-world beliefs and then, RWA, as anticipated in H2a.\nResults presented in this article consistently demonstrated the direct and indirect relations between mindfulness, (a) tax evasion intentions, and (b) support for tax progressivity. These results add to the mindfulness literature by providing new insights on the motivational paths for how mindfulness may relate to citizens\u2019 attitudes and behavioral intentions toward taxes and the tax system. Although studies on citizens\u2019 tax attitudes and behaviors are abundant [50\u201354], to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to investigate whether and how mindfulness relates with people\u2019s tax-related preferences and behavioral intentions.\nIn Study 1, we found that mindfulness negatively relates with tax evasion intentions through lower SDO. This is consistent with previous results [22] showing that SDO mediates the positive impact of mindfulness on pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors.\nIn Study 2, we dug deeper on mechanisms, and found that the relation between mindfulness and support for progressive taxation is channeled by competitive-jungle beliefs and, in turn, SDO; instead, there is no mediation through the pathway running through dangerous-world beliefs and RWA. By finding that the relation between mindfulness and support for progressive taxation is primarily attributable to the motivational path of SDO, these results dovetailed with previous findings [22] and provided an extension of Study 1. It appears that mindfulness is more associated with the SDO path than with the RWA path. This is because of the emphasis of mindfulness on pro-sociality and its associated beneficial effects [12], which we see as more consistent with the SDO focus on hierarchical intergroup relations. Instead, the importance of conformity and traditional normative values\u2014along with intragroup hierarchy\u2014makes the pathway running through RWA comparatively less apt to relate with tax attitudes and intentions. These results contribute thus to the body of knowledge about how mindfulness is more likely to produce pro-social effects [12], and they may stimulate future research in this vein.\nInterestingly, we found a significant negative association between mindfulness and SDO, which stems from competitive-jungle beliefs, whereas mindfulness is unrelated with RWA, which stems from dangerous-world beliefs. One possible explanation for these results could start by remembering how Edward Burke conservatism viewed history and time: \u201cHistory is a pact between the dead, the living, and the yet unborn.\u201d RWA and its concern with tradition and time-hallowed practices may lead individuals to conceptualize time as a seamless dimension: time is mentally represented as a linear path in which past, present, and future are not sharply separated from one another, but rather merged all together into a continuous time flow. This conceptualization of time may fit well with the disposition of mindfulness to \u201cstay in touch\u201d with whatever individuals are experiencing moment by moment\u2014hence, a positive link may exist between conservatives\u2019 conceptualization of time and mindfulness. However, RWA is concerned with the dangers a changing world poses to time-hallowed traditions, and such a risk-averse and prevention focus pulls away from sustained attention to the present moment in favor of preoccupied focus on the future. These features of conservatism and RWA should relate negatively with mindfulness. Hence, we may conjecture that the observed lack of association is the end result of opposites cancelling each other\u2014associations between RWA and dangerous-world beliefs on the one side, and with mindfulness on the other.\nAlthough further investigations are needed, these two studies put mindfulness on the agenda of taxation research as an important issue to consider. Moreover, they shed light on motivational pathways through which being mindful relates with both tax evasion intentions and support for a progressive tax system. Our results represent solid ground for future examinations of socio-psychological factors responsible for citizens\u2019 tax evasion intentions and support for a progressive tax system. A deeper understanding of such factors is not only theoretically relevant\u2014it is indeed key for promoting pro-social attitudes and behaviors of taxpayers, as well as practical interventions aimed at ameliorating economic inequality.\nWe focused on a single country, i.e., Italy, and recruited participants from the Italian population. Specificity of the country-related context is a double-edged sword, with potentially positive but also limiting consequences. On the positive edge, it enables us to investigate the link between mindfulness, (a) tax evasion intentions, and (b) support for progressive taxation in an environment where potentially relevant factors affecting tax attitudes and behaviors are constant, without the complexities that would be added by considering the variability of tax codes across different national contexts. On the negative edge, results obtained in a single specific context are, of course, limited, and surveying participants who live under different tax systems would have strengthened the research design. Beyond the domain of progressive taxation, it could be also useful for both research and practice to investigate our hypotheses by considering different taxation-related dependent variables such as flat tax rate and consumption taxes.\nMoreover, it would be desirable to move toward a causal analysis of the predictive role of being mindful on tax-related outcomes. In this direction, future research could include short mindfulness trainings, self-administered via web applications and smart technologies [55], as experimental manipulation of mindfulness in the research design. This is not a perfunctory call for experimentation, but\u2014in this context\u2014it is relevant in terms of applicability of our results: given that tax evasion and tax progressivity entail important economic and social consequences, investigating short mindfulness trainings as potential tools for promoting pro-sociality among taxpayers is a major economic and political issue.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback.\nThanks for your feedback."

He said the new envoy had to cooperate with regional forces to succeed in reaching an agreement that would end the war.\nActivists said the envoy should focus on ending Houthi rights abuses and secure the release of hundreds of war prisoners.\n\u201cWe strongly demand he personally pay attention to the issue of abducted and detained women in Houthi prisons and to provide them with psychological and legal support,\u201d Amat Al-Salam Al-Hajj, chair of the Mothers of Abductees Association, an umbrella organization for thousands of female relatives of war prisoners, told Arab News.\nhttps://www.albawaba.com/news/another-un-envoy-yemen-can-war-end-1436862\nWith war and blockade persisting, the UN new envoy for Yemen will make no difference, member of the Houthi Supreme Political Council tweeted on Saturday, calling on the international community to support real peace that would end the war.The UN and its Security Council need to \"change their policy from supporting the US-UK-Saudi-Emirati coalition and allies to supporting real peace,\" Mohamed Ali al-Houthi added hours after the UN Secretary-General appointed the fourth special envoy for Yemen.\"This is the first serious move. No new envoy can make difference.. as long as supporting the aggression and continuous blockade is their dominant course.\"\nhttps://debriefer.net/en/news-25940.html\n[Sanaa gov.] Yemeni Foreign Minister: We welcome all truthful endeavours to achieve peace in Yemen\nYemeni Foreign Minister Hisham Sharaf said on Saturday that \u201cSana\u2019a is open to all international and regional endeavours and efforts to end the aggression and lift the siege.\u201d\nhttps://hodhodyemennews.net/2021/07/03/yemeni-foreign-minister-we-welcome-all-truthful-endeavours-to-achieve-peace-in-yemen/\nAccording to the Director Yemen desk, at Mersaad think-tank, with the departure of Omani delegation to Sanaa, there was a promising perspective that war would stop, everybody was waiting for a serious incident in this respect. But with statements of political authorities of Haadi government, and also Sanaa government, it was clear that the talks would lead to nowhere.\nAn expert in Yemen developments, Ahmad Haji Sadeghian, pointed out the field and political developments in Yemen and also efforts of some countries like Oman to play intermediary role to settle the Yemeni crisis, he added: After Biden took office, the US increased her efforts to put an end to Yemeni crisis. He even appointed a special representative for Yemen affairs. They tried to proceed and to sort out the crisis by using international and regional mediators.He said:\u201d unfortunately, within the past month, the developments took a direction that we witnessed the efforts led to no result\u201d. He added:\u201d The Omani delegation headed by the Foreign Minister paid a visit to Sanaa and reached agreements with Ansarullah but the agreements led to no result.The Yemeni expert quoted the Reuters report on the comments of two sources of Yemeni Ansarullah who had said the coalition of Saudi Arabia and Ansarullah were on the eve of peace agreement. He said in the meantime that in view of the status of political and field developments, it seems that Omani mediation was not acceptable by Saudis. For example, Mr. Hamed Aasem, a member of Ansarullah negotiating delegation in an interview with Al-Alam network said the talks led to no result. Ansarullah ceased Ma\u2019areb operations for nearly 40 days in order to clarify the peace talk situation but the Coalition and Haadi government are not ready to agree.Having quoted the Yemeni expert, the report published by Reuters was aiming at media publicity against Ansarullah in order not to mention the obstacles raised by the Coalition to put an end to Yemeni crisis, and to introduce Saudi Arabia Coalition as peace lover and Ansarullah as war mongers who oppose peace.\nHaji Sadeghina added that:\u201d In the course of the negotiations, Ansarullah was said that the airport is not allowed to reopen. Only al-Hodaideh port under the supervision of Saudi coalition and Al-Haadi government can be reopened. This was in contrast with the agreement between Omani delegation and Ansarullah in Sanaa, which caused Ansarullah to declare that negotiations led to no result.Referring to Lebanese al-Akhbar daily report that Saudi Arabia did not keep verbal promises to Omani side about her agreement with separation of humane issues and other issues, he emphasized:\u201d there is possibility that due to the recent field developments, activation of fronts and recent attacks of both sides during the recent days, we should wait for another round of spiraling tensions specially in Ma\u2019areb front, Ansarullah missile and drone attacks against the positions of Saudi and the Coalition.\nHaji Sadeghina underscored:\u201d Saudis are not ready to accept Ansarullah as a part of future governance of Yemen, and that the group can remain in Yemen as a stabilized political and social power. From the other hand, they try in various cases to prevent their political and social advancement.On the perspective of war in Yemen and status of peace agreements he said:\u201d There is no perspective for peace and putting an end to war in short term, until and unless there are serious changes in general characteristics of political and field developments in Yemen, which seems unlikely to happen within the coming two to three months. Since the Yemeni dossier is directly connected to the national security of Saudi Arabia, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that they will decide to withdraw from their positions. On the other side, since Ansarullah can not be given any guarantee for its future, it is not ready to withdraw.\nhttps://en.abna24.com/news/political-expert-field-developments-in-yemen-dubious-perspective-of-peace-talks_1156172.html\nThe UN SG @antonioguterres has selected the #Swedish Diplomat HANS GRUNDBERG, currently The EU Ambassador to #Yemen, as the next Special envoy to Yemen.

Our work centres on supporting inclusive consultative committees that ensure a wide range of voices are heard in governorate-level decision-making, engage in mediation initiatives, and work to strengthen cooperation between local authorities and local civil society. These committees are currently active in Dhamar, Hadhramawt and al-Mahra, with an expansion of the model planned to Amran.\nSupport to the consultative committees is financed through the project \u2018Strengthening inclusive local governance and peacebuilding in Yemen,\u2019 which is implemented in close cooperation with a GIZ sister project that works with district-level authorities and the consultative committees to identify and implement urgent small infrastructure and service delivery projects. Both are financed by the German Federal Foreign Office.\nThe projects together were designed to pilot approaches to working with and complementing existing governorate- and district-level institutions in Yemen. They have been successful in safeguarding local state capacity, supporting delivery of urgently needed services without recourse to parallel structures, strengthening local capacities for conflict mediation, fostering local dialogue, and encouraging more inclusive decision-making.\nIn light of the positive impacts and dynamics emerging around the consultative committees, this article documents emerging lessons from the pilot project that can help inform Yemeni policy makers thinking about local governance issues and international actors looking to mitigate the impact of conflict and lay the foundations for peace. Few of these lessons will be surprising to practitioners who have engaged with the discussions on local governance and peacebuilding in conflict-affected contexts of the past decade. Yet, they bear repeating and highlighting in this specific context, where international actors risk repeating past mistakes.\nIn Yemen, there remains an urgent need for political discussion, dialogue, and exchange between different groups and parties. From a peacebuilding perspective, creating space for dialogue is essential for finding negotiated solutions and avoiding the entanglement of local disagreements with national-level violent conflict. From a local governance perspective, local dialogue supports social cohesion and can improve the responsiveness of local governance. Yet, while fora need to be created and maintained in order to be ready when opportunities arise, dialogue for dialogue\u2019s sake is a recipe for frustration.\nDialogue formats that have aims beyond the talking and that offer participants concrete possibilities for action allow a focus on concrete problems and locally generated solutions. By focusing on issues of shared local concern, the project has supported local actors to bridge, rather than reinforce, conflict divides.\nThe project was designed to complement and facilitate the work of existing formal and informal local governance structures. Consultative committees were drawn from local authorities, tribal structures, and civil society to facilitate discussions and information exchange between them.\nhttps://berghof-foundation.org/news/seven-lessons-for-inclusive-local-governance-and-peacebuilding-in-yemen\nFeminist Peace Convening - @sanambna founder of @whatthewomensay \"If anyone in the international community thinks civil society involvement in ceasefire monitoring is a fantasy, they need to move aside.\" #FeministPeaceYE #Yemen (texts in image)\nhttps://twitter.com/Peace_Track/status/1411011472554143744\nA senior Yemeni official reacted to the latest remarks by US Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking about ongoing clashes in the country\u2019s strategic central province of Ma\u2019rib, emphasizing that Yemeni people dismiss the call for peace with parties that are targeting and killing them on a daily basis.\n\u201cYemeni people hate siege, attacks by the Saudi-led coalition and their mercenaries, as well as the call for peace with aggressors who are killing them every day,\u201d Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of Yemen's Supreme Political Council, wrote in a series of posts published on his Twitter page late on Thursday, presstv reported.\nHe added, \u201cThe United States is negotiating with and supporting Al-Qaeda and Daesh [Takfiri terrorist groups] worldwide. This is while it expresses concern over the Yemeni nation\u2019s campaign and struggle against these terrorists.\u201d\n\u201cThe hatred for America will end as soon as its aggression stops, the siege is lifted and the occupation of Yemen halts. This is what the Leader of Ansarullah movement [Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi] has long been demanding,\u201d Houthi pointed out.\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the United States stop selling its weapons to those waging aggression against Yemen? The main reason is its insistence to prolong the war and occupy Yemen,\u201d the senior Yemeni official noted.\nhttps://www.farsnews.ir/en/news/14000411000355/Hhi-Says-Yemeni-Peple-Rejec-Call-fr-Peace-wih-Thse-Killing-Them\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed on Thursday its readiness to facilitate exchanging prisoners between the various parties in Yemen's years-long conflict.During a press conference held in the country's southern port city of Aden, ICRC President Peter Maurer reaffirmed that his teams operating in Yemen's branches are still working to help those affected by the conflict.He previously spoke with Yemen's Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik on the urgent humanitarian challenges in the Yemeni regions.Maurer reiterated the \"ICRC's readiness to continue facilitating any future detainee release operations between the parties to the conflict.\"\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202107/1227644.shtml\nThe next envoy will be asked to find a quick path to peace where no obvious one exists, armed with little leverage for budging the emboldened and well-positioned Houthis.\nWith the announcement of a new UN special envoy to Yemen coming soon, peace seems as elusive as ever.\nOmani action and international political will are not the only factors that have changed in the past year. The overall context in Yemen has shifted\u2014the Houthis ramped up their fight in Marib and increased their missile and drone attacks on Saudi territory; Riyadh offered public concessions to end the war; and the United States appointed a new special envoy of its own to rally regional support for a solution. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s various anti-Houthi forces remained split by internal squabbles and unable to unite politically or militarily against their common enemy.\nDespite these developments, many Yemenis believe that the Houthis are uninterested in making a deal even with Omani pressure. Others hypothesize that the Houthis are using delay tactics so that their sponsor, Iran, can play Yemen as a card in the ongoing Vienna nuclear talks. This camp argues that reaching an agreement at the current stage would merely solidify the group\u2019s military gains into political gains. Instead, they believe anti-Houthi forces should close ranks and push the rebels out of Marib. Yet the ongoing disunity among those forces means that only some of their military units are near the Marib front and willing to carry out such a campaign\nhttps://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/uneasy-state-play-awaits-new-un-envoy-yemen\nMy comment: From an Usneocon thinktank. The main blockade to any UN peace attempt is not even mentioned here: UN Security Council resolution 2216 grpm 2015, claiming the Houthis must surrender. As long as there is no other resolution, they are forced to continue fighting.\nFilm: #TRTWorldForum's #DigitalDebates hosted @Dr_E_Kendall, Senior Research Fellow in Arabic and Islamic Studies, Pembroke College, @UniofOxford, to discuss Yemen\u2019s civil war and the current humanitarian crisis with a focus the major challenges facing humanitarian organisations.\nhttps://twitter.com/trtworldforum/status/1410538674798968834\nA Gulf source close to decision-making circles downplayed the chances of a breakthrough via the political route. He acknowledged the UN and American involvement in consultation with Saudi Arabia, but cast doubt on the prospect of Omani mediation efforts bearing fruit, accusing the Houthi rebels of reneging on promises. The present Omani role is different from the role Oman played seven years ago helping the US and Iran to reach the nuclear deal. He noted that at the time there was no war between Washington and Tehran, and neither had border proximity to the Sultanate. Those were talks between two states, what is more, while present talks involve a militia that is a proxy for Iran.\nAsked by the Weekly if the issue is Saudi Arabia agreeing to direct dialogue with the Houthis, the source reiterated that Saudi Arabia and the Arab Coalition would recognise Houthi as part of the Yemeni landscape and would definitely be a party of any peaceful settlement. But he stressed that \u201cso far, it is up to the Yemeni factions including the Houthis to come up together and reach a political reconciliation\u201d towards a lasting peaceful solution. \u201cUnless the rebel militia lays down arms and accepts the political track it will be futile to engage with them. The coalition does not want to continue with the war, but Iran is encouraging their proxy to keep the fire on.\u201d\nWhat is clear is that all parties are wary of the prolonged military conflict with its disastrous humanitarian consequences. Yet it seems every party is trying hard to improve its bargaining position in any upcoming negotiations by scoring advances on the ground. How long this manoeuvring will continue is not clear. In the course of it, millions of Yemenis continue to suffer.\nhttps://english.ahram.org.eg/News/416280.aspx\nThe UN welcomed on Monday Saudi Arabia\u2019s new peace initiative to end the war in Yemen.The proposals align with the world body\u2019s own efforts, Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that every effort must be made to end the conflict in Yemen and address the suffering of the Yemeni people and the UN looks forward to continue working with all the parties to achieve this goal,\u201d he said.\nhttps://www.arabnews.com/node/1829946/saudi-arabia\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) provides spoiled food continuously and in insufficient quantities in all provinces in Yemen, forcing poor families to sell the food basket in exchange for a simple healthy food.\nNearly 10 million people across Yemen remain \u201cjust a step away from famine.\nThere are enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month has sat unused and possibly spoiling in silos at the mills and that's because Hadi's government and silence of the United Nations.\nIn a statement on the depot, known as the Red Sea Mills. \"No-one gains anything from this, but millions of starving people suffer\".\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) alone, has 51,000 metric tons of wheat stored there, a quarter of its in-country wheat stock and enough to feed 3.7 million people for a month. WFP has been unable to access the Mills since September 2018 because of fighting.\nAccess to the mills grows progressively more urgent as the longer they remain inaccessible, and the risk of grain spoilage is growing each day.\nThe WFP tried to bring large quantities of spoiled flour into Yemen, under the justification of disbursing it as aid to the Yemeni people.\nThe organizations are politicizing humanitarian aid and trying to exploit and pressure to pass agendas and achieve advantages that they were unable to achieve by military force, in addition to using starvation and siege as a means of war with UN cover and silence.\nThey also play suspicious intelligence roles in favor of international powers. Espionage or intelligence work sometimes does not stop at mere information gathering, but rather goes beyond that to sow division and rivalry among Yemenis.\nAs well as, there are some international organizations that do not adhere to standards and specifications with regard to purchase, production date, expiry, transportation and storage methods, according to technical, health and humanitarian requirements.\nThe corruption of organizations stands behind international corruption that seeks to exploit the needs of the victims and achieve harm to those targeted by them in exchange for imaginary financial gains and profits.\nhttps://www.saba.ye/en/news3145864.htm\nMy remark: By the Houthi side.\nA peace deal may be close to being clinched, reports say, as Oman seeks direct talks between Houthis and Saudi Arabia.\nOman, long perceived as a neutral party in the Middle East, has spent the past few weeks attempting to get Saudi Arabia and Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels to the negotiating table.\nIf reports are to be believed, the mediators may be close to success, and Saudi Arabia and the Iran-allied Houthis are \u201cthrashing out terms for a peace deal\u201d. Yet, despite Omani attempts, that may be wishful thinking.\n\u201cThe good news is that there is clearly more focus on direct negotiations with the Houthi leadership in Sanaa,\u201d Peter Salisbury, the International Crisis Group\u2019s senior Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThe bad news is that this hasn\u2019t yet closed the gap between the Houthis\u2019 and the Saudis\u2019 positions. Until that happens, we won\u2019t see much movement.\u201d\nThe positions of both sides have moved little since a Saudi offer of a nationwide ceasefire in Yemen was rejected by the Houthis in March.\nThe Houthis say elements of that offer, such as the reopening of Sanaa\u2019s airport and unhindered access to Hodeidah port, where the majority of Yemen\u2019s food is imported, should be unconditional.\n\u201cAfter that, we will discuss a comprehensive ceasefire which should be a real halt of hostilities, not a fragile truce, and that would include the exit of foreign powers from Yemen to facilitate political negotiations,\u201d Mohammed Abdulsalam, the Houthi spokesman, told Reuters news agency on June 21.\nThose terms are difficult for the Saudis to accept, and despite six years of a costly war that have brought little success, Riyadh is unlikely to be willing to abandon Yemen with few guarantees over its own security, and with an ally of its greatest regional adversary, Iran, entrenched on its southern border.\n\u201cUntil now the Saudis have wanted iron-clad guarantees on border security and Iranian influence in Yemen, and have wanted to have an ally play an influential role in politics going forward,\u201d said Salisbury.\n\u201cThat position may have moderated a bit, but ending the war with only, say, a deal on the border and nothing else, would be a bitter pill to swallow.\u201d\nFor their part, the Houthis believe the balance of power has shifted, and they have the upper hand militarily.\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/29/oman-takes-on-ambitious-mediator-role-in-yemen-conflict\nWhile Yemeni IDPs starve, the UNDP announced a tender to procure food for the dogs of its employees./Aden Alghad\nhttps://www.alsahwa-yemen.net/en/p-47549\nDer Vorsitzende des Obersten Politischen Rates im Jemen sagte, dass die US-Verantwortlichen bisher keine Ma\u00dfnahmen ergriffen h\u00e4tten, um Frieden im Jemen herzustellen, und dass ihre \u00c4u\u00dferungen nur f\u00fcr die Medien bestimmt seien.\n\"Wir haben bis heute keinen wirklichen Schritt der USA f\u00fcr den Frieden im Jemen gesehen\", sagte Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, der Vorsitzende des Obersten Politischen Rates im Jemen, am Montag laut dem Sender Al-Manar.\nhttps://parstoday.com/de/news/middle_east-i59610-ansarullah_usa_haben_keine_ma%C3%9Fnahmen_ergriffen_um_frieden_im_jemen_herzustellen\nMember of the Supreme Political Council in Sana\u2019a, Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi, said on Monday that the statements of US officials regarding peace in Yemen are only for \u201cmedia consumption\u201d, without any realistic field steps.\nAl-Houthi pointed out in a press statement Monday, that it is the US \u201cwho wages war on the Yemeni people, continues to bomb them with planes, imposes a siege on them, and occupies parts of Yemen through its tools in the region.\u201d\n\u201cThe US administration can prove its seriousness about peace by stopping the raids and lifting the blockade on imports of food, medicine and fuel,\u201d he added.\nhttps://hodhodyemennews.net/2021/06/28/mohammed-al-houthi-us-statements-about-peace-are-just-for-show/\nand also https://en.mehrnews.com/news/175437/US-statements-on-peace-in-Yemen-just-rhetoric-Ansarullah\nDisturbing news that Dr. Abdulaziz AlDhakee, one of our country's leading economists, who has been in #Saudi Clan prison since last year has died behind bars.

If once a peripheral player in the minds of many inside the Beltway, during the past decade, Abu Dhabi in particular has managed to turn itself into a veritable force within Washington's influence trade, and to elevate itself into a privileged strategic and economic partner of the United States. Such achievements have unfortunately come at grave cost to the communities and countries falling within the UAE's orbit. Though forced to adopt a less overtly interventionist posture in the post-Trump period, Abu Dhabi's royals have, after all, long represented one of the most active and ubiquitous counterrevolutionary forces in the Middle East and North Africa. Despite the changing of the guard at the White House this past January as well as recent revisions to the United States' outlook on Libya and Yemen, moreover, they continue to leverage their financial, military, and diplomatic power in theaters stretching from Sudan to Iraq, doing so in each instance in order to oppose those struggling for political, social, and economic emancipation.

While justifications like countering terrorism, defending Israel, preventing nuclear proliferation, preserving stability, and protecting human rights deserve consideration, none merit the current level of U.S. troops in the region; in some cases, the presence of the U.S. military actually undermines these concerns.\nQuincy Institute paper No. 2 asserted that the core U.S. interests in the Middle East are protecting the United States from attack and facilitating the free flow of global commerce. These interests generate the following two primary objectives for the U.S. military in the Middle East: to prevent the establishment of a regional hegemon and to protect the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz.\nThe United States has no compelling military need to keep a permanent troop presence in the Middle East.\nThis raises the following questions: Does any country in the Middle East have the capability to achieve either of these objectives, or is any country within near-term striking distance of having such capability? What actions would the U.S. military need to take to tip the balance of capabilities against an adversary seeking either regional hegemony or to close the Strait?\nThe four possible contenders for regional hegemony are Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. To achieve the status of military hegemon, one of these states would have to have the capacity to knock out at least two of the others. To achieve this would require their army to possess at least five core capabilities: 1) logistics capacity to supply an advancing army; 2) ability to defend moving troops; 3) ability to respond to unforeseen circumstances; 4) ability to execute complex combined arms maneuvers on the offensive; and 5) ability to maintain control of captured territory.\nNone of the four potential contenders in the Middle East has the requisite capabilities, and none has the plausible potential to rapidly acquire these capabilities in a way that would give it a relative advantage over its opponents.\nCompletely blocking the exit from the Persian Gulf would be a difficult task for any Middle Eastern military: An attacker would need to routinely hit and disable approximately 10 oil tankers each day, requiring multiple successful strikes per ship, firing roughly 50 missiles per day. The attacker would have to keep its forces alive and operational in the face of defenders\u2019 efforts to prevent the attacks. Iran is the state that has threatened to close the Strait, yet it lacks the military capacity necessary to do so. Perhaps the greatest contribution that the United States could make to the continuing safe transit of oil through the Strait of Hormuz is to step back from the brink of conflict with Iran.\nDespite alarmism about the possibility of Russia or China making a bid for regional hegemony in the Middle East, neither has undertaken a concerted effort to do so. Russia\u2019s presence in Syria is long-standing, and in general, Russia appears motivated to expand its role as a regional mediator; China is primarily interested in expanding its economic ties to the region. Both have observed U.S. military misadventures in the region, and neither appears eager to repeat America\u2019s mistakes. Most importantly, neither has the capability to overcome the obstacles that made U.S. military operations in the region so difficult and costly \u2014 nor to potentially achieve a more expansive aim than the United States ever tried to achieve, namely establishing regional hegemony.\nTo help protect the existing multipolar balance of power in the region, the United States should reduce arms sales, or at least prioritize the sale of defensive capacities, and offer strategic intelligence to all regional players, so any potential troop build up will be known in advance. If the United States needed to fight a war, it has the air and naval power to do so without peacetime presence or operations on the ground.\nGiven the extreme difficulties faced either by a would-be regional hegemon or an attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, the United States has no compelling military need to keep a permanent troop presence in the Middle East. It should be the medium- to long-term objective of the United States to align its military presence with its strategic interests in the Middle East, beginning a responsible and timely drawdown of U.S. forces in the region now.\nhttps://quincyinst.org/report/nothing-much-to-do-why-america-can-bring-all-troops-home-from-the-middle-east/\nand also https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/06/24/symposium-time-to-bring-all-u-s-troops-home-from-the-middle-east/\nSaudi intel chief who saved U.S. lives was detained, allegedly mistreated by Saudi government\n\"The Trump White House did nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 to help him,\" said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer.\nThe Biden administration is under increasing pressure to help a former Saudi intelligence chief credited with saving American lives who was initially detained by the Saudi government during the Trump administration.

Dieses Interview sollte sicher die folgende Schrift flankieren:\nDie Islamische Republik Iran hat ihren Einfluss im Nahen Osten seit 2011 stark ausgeweitet. Doch hat diese Expansion ihren H\u00f6hepunkt schon 2018 erreicht. Seitdem tritt sie in eine neue Phase, in der Teheran zwar keine strategischen milit\u00e4rischen R\u00fcckschl\u00e4ge erlebt, aber an Grenzen st\u00f6\u00dft.\nDas gr\u00f6\u00dfte grunds\u00e4tzliche Problem Irans ist, dass seine Verb\u00fcndeten im Libanon, Syrien, Irak und Jemen mehrheitlich und in erster Linie milit\u00e4rische und terroristische Akteure sind. Es gelingt ihnen zwar h\u00e4ufig, in bewaffneten Auseinandersetzungen Erfolge zu erzielen. Doch erweisen sie sich anschlie\u00dfend als unf\u00e4hig, f\u00fcr politische und wirtschaftliche Stabilit\u00e4t zu sorgen.\nDie beste Option f\u00fcr die deutsche und die europ\u00e4ische Politik ist die einer Eind\u00e4mmungsstrategie, deren langfristiges Ziel das Ende der iranischen Expansion in den vier genannten L\u00e4ndern ist, die aber kurzfristig auf der Einsicht beruht, dass Teheran und seine alliierten Akteure in einer starken Position sind.\nEin Bestandteil einer Eind\u00e4mmungsstrategie w\u00e4re eine m\u00f6glichst weitgehende Isolierung und Sanktionierung der bewaffneten Kooperationspartner Irans.

Was die EU schlichweg nichts angeht.\nIt is terrible coverage of an important issue, and it serves to distort the Iran policy debate even more than it already is.\nA new article on Biden and Iran in The New York Times this week typifies the serious flaws in a lot of American reporting about Iran and related issues. David Sanger frames Biden\u2019s approach to Iran as a \u201cbalancing act\u201d between sometimes bombing Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and negotiating over the U.S. return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The two issues are \u201cdeeply intertwined,\u201d Sanger informs us, but he doesn\u2019t talk about the thing that actually links them, which is the ongoing economic war against Iran that Biden has continued. The only reference to sanctions in the entire article is a passing mention of sanctions imposed on the incoming Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi.\nThere are several points where the article presents the reader with false or misleading information, and there are several places where important context is left out. Sanger refers to Iran\u2019s \u201cmarch toward the capacity to build a nuclear weapon,\u201d but there is no such march. To the extent that Iran has increased enrichment, it has done so to protest the sanctions imposed on them by Trump and kept in place by Biden. If the U.S. would rescind these sanctions, Iran would resume complying with the agreement as they had done for the first three and a half years since implementation started. He describes this \u201cmarch\u201d as being \u201cin part an effort to demonstrate that Tehran is a force to be reckoned with in the Middle East and beyond,\u201d but the Iranian government had accepted extensive restrictions on its nuclear program and intrusive inspections to verify compliance just a few years ago. Whatever effort Iran might be making to show that it is a \u201cforce to be reckoned with,\u201d it decided that building up its nuclear program was no longer a necessary part of that. The problem is that the U.S. under Trump refused to take yes for an answer and insisted on a raft of new demands that Iran was never going to accept.\nhttps://daniellarison.substack.com/p/a-thoroughly-misleading-article-on\nIn the current geopolitical context, the Abraham Accords, which normalized Israel\u2019s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain during the final months of the Trump administration, could prove destabilizing by lowering the bar for Israeli military action against Iran.1\nThe destabilizing potential of the Abraham Accords will increase if talks to revive the Iran nuclear agreement collapse. This, in turn, suggests that revival of the accord, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, remains important for U.S. security and regional stability.\nBy securing the JCPOA and supporting diplomacy between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the U.S. maximizes the viability and utility of the Abraham Accords as well as their compatibility with a new and more inclusive regional security architecture. But supporting only the Abraham Accords without reentering the JCPOA and encouraging multilateral dialogue among the Arab Gulf states and Iran could transform the accords from a potential strategic asset to a liability.\nhttps://quincyinst.org/report/israel-and-the-persian-gulf-a-source-of-security-or-conflict/\nDiplomats negotiating for months over Iran\u2019s nuclear program now face the prospect of new delays and rising risk that they\u2019ll fail to resurrect a landmark deal between the Islamic Republic and world powers.\nEnvoys won\u2019t reconvene as planned this week in Vienna and aren\u2019t sure when a seventh round of diplomacy will be scheduled, according to four officials who asked not to be identified discussing the talks. Negotiations are being closely watched by energy markets because of the potential flood of Iranian oil that would be unleashed by a return to the agreement, which capped the Persian Gulf country\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief and unraveled with the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 exit.\nEuropean and U.S. diplomats originally sought to restore the accord before this month\u2019s Iranian presidential elections, won by hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who\u2019s widely seen as less willing to compromise with the West. The European Union\u2019s deputy foreign policy chief Enrique Mora twice predicted an imminent conclusion to the talks only to be stymied by the refusal of Iran and the U.S. to budge from their positions.\nThe mood among nuclear inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency has similarly soured, according to two other officials. A temporary monitoring pact between Iran and IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi is closer to failure than extension, potentially complicating talks even further by eliminating information needed to verify Iran\u2019s baseline nuclear capacity.\n\u201cThere are some very significant differences that remain,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday in Rome. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you whether we\u2019ll succeed in overcoming these differences.\u201d\nChief sticking points are orchestrating the sequence of a U.S. return to the July 14, 2015 accord and renewed Iranian compliance, along with the Treasury Department\u2019s dense web of sanctions, according to the officials. Confidential settlements between the U.S. and multinational corporations previously found in violation of broader Iran sanctions are a further complication because they threaten to undermine Iranian access to markets even if an agreement is struck.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/iran-diplomacy-nerves-fray-as-atomic-talks-run-into-summer\nThe United Nations, European Union and many Security Council members urged the United States and Iran on Wednesday to quickly put the 2015 nuclear deal aimed at reining in Tehran\u2019s nuclear program back on track, but neither side showed any sign of movement toward an agreement.\nDuring six rounds of talks in Vienna, the six countries that remain parties to the agreement -- Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran -- have been trying to resolve major outstanding issues on how the United States can rejoin. Then-President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018, but President Joe Biden repudiated his predecessor and said the U.S. wants to return to the pact.\nAfter the latest Vienna talks June 20, the EU official who coordinated the meeting, Enrique Mora, told reporters: \u201cWe are closer to a deal, but we are not there.\u201d Top Russian representative Mikhail Ukyanov said that \u201cthe time has come for political decisions\u201d ahead of what is supposed to be a final round of negotiations.\nBut in the Security Council on Wednesday, diplomats from Iran and the United States took tough stands, giving no hint of compromise during a meeting on implementation of the 2015 council resolution that endorsed the nuclear agreement.\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-europe-middle-east-iran-iran-nuclear-2659ed6a716ac75ea0f51c22542015d9\nDer Generalsekret\u00e4r der Iranischen Islamischen Radio- und Fernsehunion (IRTVU) sagte auf der 10.

Allison takes an inside look into the Carter administration's policy toward the Second Yemenite War in 1979 and the establishment of the Carter Doctrine.\nOn March 7, 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed Presidential Determination 79\u20136, approving the sale of aircraft, tanks, and armored personnel carriers to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR, aka North Yemen); the same day, he ordered the aircraft carrier USS Constellation to the Gulf of Aden, off the Yemeni coast. The arms sale, according to the determination, was \u201cin the national security interests of the United States.\u201d\nCarter\u2019s decision came in response to a crisis on the Arabian Peninsula. The YAR and its communist neighbor, the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY, aka South Yemen), had clashed in a border conflict that resulted in a South Yemeni invasion of North Yemen, raising concerns about the security of the United States\u2019 important regional partner, Saudi Arabia. With the ongoing Egyptian-Israeli peace process entering its crucial final stage, mounting concerns about the encroachment of the Soviets and their friends in the region, and the fall of the pro-American Pahlavi regime in Iran, American power and credibility in the Greater Middle East was quickly slipping.\nWashington recognized that it needed to \u201cuse some muscle,\u201d as Vice President Walter Mondale put it, to reassure regional partners of American steadfastness. As a result, the Carter administration took its most aggressive action in the region to that point, making the Second Yemenite War, as it came to be known, a turning point in both the region\u2019s history and in American policy toward the Middle East.\nhttps://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/jimmy-carter-and-second-yemenite-war-smaller-shock-1979\nThe UK sold arms and military equipment to dozens of countries that have been criticised for their record on human rights and civil liberties, according to a new report.\nAccording to Freedom House, a US government-funded human rights group, between 2011 and 2020 the UK licensed \u00a316.8bn ($23.32bn) in arms to 39 countries castigated over their poor record on human rights, The Guardian reported on Sunday.\nThe London-based Campaign Against Arms Trade (Caat) also found that during the same period, \u00a311.8bn ($16.38bn) of arms had been authorised by the British government to countries on the Foreign Office's own list of repressive regimes.\nThe British Department for International Trade has identified nine countries, including Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, as \"core markets\" for arms exports despite rights groups saying they are guilty of serious human rights abuses.\n\"These arms sales are not just numbers, they have consequences,\" Andrew Smith, of the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (Caat), told Middle East Eye on Monday.\n\"As long as arms company profits are put ahead of human rights, then these atrocities and abuses will continue unabated.\n\"The UK government is always telling us about the important role that it plays on the world stage, which is precisely why these arms sales need to stop.\"\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-arms-sales-dozens-countries-criticised-human-rights\nThe UK ambassador to Yemen, Michael Aron, has on Tuesday confirmed that his country has deployed troops in Saudi-occupied areas in eastern Yemen, in a clear recognition of his country\u2019s direct involvement in the six-year war, Yemen News Portal reported.\nAron pointed out during a TV statement that his country has military units in the province of Mahrah, one of the most prominent strategic sites in eastern Yemen.\nHe justified the British military presence by calling it \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d although Mahrah is known to have never been the scene of terrorist groups except those resettled by the coalition on the Omani border as part of their long-term presence plan in the province, which Saudi Arabia is seeking to turn into a gateway to export Saudi oil through the Arabian Sea.\nThe United Kingdom recently redeployed military units along Yemen\u2019s southern and eastern coasts, as part of a repositioning of troops following its plans tp withdraw from Afghanistan alongside the United States.\nhttps://hodhodyemennews.net/2021/06/29/british-ambassador-to-yemen-admits-uk-troops-are-taking-part-in-occupation-of-eastern-yemen/\nDer Au\u00dfenminister des Jemens fordert von Deutschland, Druck auf den Iran auszu\u00fcben, um ein Ende des B\u00fcrgerkriegs in seinem Land herbeizuf\u00fchren.

But would more rules even have an impact in the region?\nThe drone attacks are part of a disturbing trend in the region: The escalating use of UAVs, both for surveillance purposes and to attack opponents, by countries in the region \u2014 but also by nonstate actors there, like militia groups in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, among others.\nResearch by the Milan-based Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) suggests that Middle Eastern nations (excluding Israel) spent at least $1.5 billion (\u20ac1.27 billion) on military drones over the last five years.\nOf all nations in this area, Israel is probably the most advanced drone-maker. But the country tends not to pass on its technology to those it considers potential enemies. Turkey, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and China are other major suppliers of drones in the region.\nIran has one of the longest-running drone programs, ISPI researcher Frederico Borsari explains. Hampered by international sanctions and lacking a modern air force, Iran has long understood that drones, supplied to allies elsewhere, could add to their air power and give them \"plausible deniability,\" Borsari said.\nDrones are likely being used by Iraqi militias against the US, or by the anti-government Houthis in Yemen against Saudi Arabia, yet experts agree it's highly likely the technical know-how comes from neighboring Iran. At the same time, Iran can deny it had anything to do with it.\nThe proliferation of drones in the Middle East is \"dangerous because it alters military hierarchies in the region,\" explained Fabian Hinz, an independent Middle East analyst based in Berlin, who focuses on drones and ballistic missiles. \"Previously, you predict the outcome of any conflict. As in, this country has so many planes and this much training, so you could estimate how strong they were. Drones and ballistic missiles shake all that up.\"\nOne key to resolving the Middle East's growing drone issue could be better regulation. In a December 2020 editorial in The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Agnes Callamard, a former United Nations special rapporteur on executions, warned that the world has entered a \"second drone age \u2026 marked by the uncontrolled proliferation of armed drones, the most advanced of which are stealthier, speedier, smaller, and more capable of targeted killings than a previous generation.\"\nCallamard argued that nation-states must work together to establish a new regime that would include \"robust standards for the design, export and use of drones\" and the transfer of related military technology.\nHinz and Rogers agree that while exports of the latest military drone technology could be controlled, it would be almost impossible to stop commercially made drone parts from reaching nonstate actors with potentially criminal intentions in the Middle East.\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/can-drone-warfare-in-the-middle-east-be-controlled/a-58111069\nMy comment: Western authors not even realize how biased they are. Drones used by Western powers and their allies are no danger of course, no where, never. The West just want others to stop using drones because this is \u201cdangerous because it alters military hierarchies\u201d, i. e. this would endanger Western superiority.\nIran has provided drones or drone technology to proxies in at least four locations: Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Gaza. Tehran\u2019s drone exports vary in mission, range, and capabilities.\nIn April 2021, Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. warned that the Middle East was becoming a \u201cproving ground for the proliferation and employment of unmanned weaponized systems, many emanating from Iran.\u201d The drone transfers were part of Iran\u2019s asymmetric strategy to compensate for its military weakness. Exporting drones provided Iran with \u201cvaluable experience in developing its own systems and in refining tactics, techniques and procedures,\u201d the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported in April 2021. Tehran\u2019s drone transfers have varied in quantity and quality.\nYemen: Since 2016, Iran has transferred drone components and provided training on drones to Houthi rebels who are fighting a civil war and a military campaign led by Saudi Arabia. The Yemeni rebels possess the most advanced and diverse drone arsenal of Iran\u2019s proxies. The Houthis built their drones using a mix of local materials and high-end components reportedly smuggled into Yemen from Iran. The Houthi drones have ranges of 15 km to 1,700 km, or nine miles to 1,056 miles. They can carry payloads of up to 30 kg (66 pounds).\nhttps://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2021/jun/30/iran%E2%80%99s-drone-transfers-proxies\nMy comment: What does the US lament about this?

He is set to visit the athletes' village in Tokyo's Harumi waterfront district and hold meetings with the organizing body, both in person and remotely.\nThe IOC is also arranging for Bach to visit Hiroshima, which was devastated by an atomic bombing in the closing days of World War II, on July 16, the starting day of an Olympic truce adopted by the United Nations.\nIOC Vice President John Coates, who arrived in Tokyo earlier, is planning on the same day to visit Nagasaki, the other Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb in 1945.\nCoates drew criticism in Japan in May for saying that the Olympics can be held even if Tokyo is under a state of emergency.\nI still do not understand the three-day quarantine, what does that accomplish?  If he gets special VIP deferential treatment anyway, don't bother with the quarantine if you are going to half-ass it that much.  There is no point of doing a quarantine for just three days, either do it right or just skip it.\nThis man and his corrupt elite should not be welcomed to a country in the midst of a pandemic.  He must be counting the $$$$$ . GREED and INCOMPETENCE.\nGo away Bach, pack up and take that rubbish superspreader event with you.\nIt\u2019s currently grey and rainy in Tokyo. Well, in Shinjuku at least.\nSeems appropriate for his visit.\nThe uncaring face of greed.\nHow true it has come to be - Tokyo residents stay home under emergency but we will party and enjoy the high stakes life at your cost - disgusting...\nPubs again need opening now no more crappy state of emergencies....\n... and usually in this kind of shot, isn't the perp is the back seat, glimpsed blurrily between the faces of the two policemen in front? (Always policemen, This is Japan).\nWelcome. And let him quickly sign the cancellation papers before he falls asleep from flight jet lag.\nQuarantine for 14 days like the rest of us have to do.\nHe should be visiting the Fukushima and Tohoku areas, as demonstrating recovery from the earthquake and tsunami being one of the main reasons that Japan was able convince people to give them the games, along with envelopes of cash through a one-room office in Singapore.\nHe'll have plenty of time to showboat in August when the full Hiroshima/ Nagasaki victim memorials are held.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQZWzgUZnHA\nEuphoria at Tokyo chosen over Instanbul Sep 2013.\nBach - you are narcissistic and selfish and certainly do not care about the citizens of Japan. We go under another State of Emergency but you are welcomed with only a 3 day quarantine.\n80% of Japanese do not want you here right now.\nWelcome to Japan mate. And not to worry, it was only 896 today in Tokyo. In your meeting tonight, do mention to Seiko that the numbers have peaked and you guys should recommend allowing spectators in.\nonly 896 today in Tokyo. In your meeting tonight, do mention to Seiko that the numbers have peaked and you guys should recommend allowing spectators in.\nOnly thing that happened was they reduced the number of people tested as they always do heading into the weekend, so we knew the number would be lower today all the way to Sunday's testing (Monday's numbers) and up again we will go.\na day after the Japanese government informally decided to place the capital under another state of emergency until Aug. 22\nInformally. Great.\nIt\u2019s good we have such decisive, informed go-getters in charge.\n\"Coates drew criticism in Japan in May for saying that the Olympics can be held even if Tokyo is under a state of emergency.\"\nHowever Suga and the other Japanese  vassals to the IOC are fully  intent on proving him 100% showing he was just making a statement of fact they fully support.\nBach is definitely sweating in the photo-for sure,an elevated temperature is the cause.\nLet's be heartful and give the Tokyo Olympic its best chance together! Thankyou.\nHope he enjoys his VIP hotel.... :)\nBach - you are narcissistic and selfish and certainly do not care about the citizens of Japan.

Not only is it the biggest sporting event of the year,  it is also the responsibility of Japan to honor its contractual agreement with the IOC to host The Olympics.

Only 4.45 million tickets were sold in Japan out of a population of 126,000,000 which represents 3.53% of the population. I do not take much credence in the refund data. It is now a moot point anyway as there will be no attendees with the exception of those of you who are VIP's or otherwise connected to the games.\nAnd yet only 18 percent of the 4.45 million\u00a0tickets\u00a0to\u00a0Olympic\u00a0events that had been sold in\u00a0Japan had applications for refund.\nThe organizers and current cheerleaders may be stupid. Those who already have tickets aren\u2019t.\nImagine what a ticket for the Titanic would be worth now.\nThe Japanese boo-birds are conveniently forgetting when their compatriots were hugging, crying and high-fiving each other when Tokyo won the right to bring the Games to that city in 2013. Not only is it the biggest sporting event of the year, it is also the responsibility of Japan to honor its contractual agreement with the IOC to host The Olympics\nSo...you're unaware of the still ongoing global pandemic that has killed 4 million?\nThis just shows how corrupt the IOC and the people closely involved with this organization are.\nSince 2008 I have boycotted the Olympics Games when China with the Support of IOC refused many many spectators entry visas into China to see the game.\nAnd yet only 18 percent of the 4.45 million\u00a0tickets\u00a0to\u00a0Olympic\u00a0events that had been sold in\u00a0Japan had applications for refund.\nThe organizers and current cheerleaders may be stupid. Those who already have tickets aren\u2019t.\nImagine what a ticket for the Titanic would be worth now.\nThat is certainly an interesting perspective and analogy which I never thought of.\nSo...you're unaware of the still ongoing global pandemic that has killed 4 million?\nTo be fair, being unaware of things is his whole shtick.\nI would bet a ton of Shekels that when Bluto arrived at his hotel, everyone bowed and slammed foreheads on the waxed floors making him believe they love this IOCGodly figure and he believed it.\nHeadline suggestion: \"Most Hated Man in Japan Arrives in Japan\".\nDear Mr. Bach:\nNow that you\u2019ve settled-in and have time to read the 20+ comments in this evenings\u2019 edition of Japan Today, we hope you will please consider both, the positive and negative comments regarding your arrival.\nBest Wishes for a positive outcome for ALL involved.\nI will never be a sporting hero, I learnt soon in junior school, run like a girl, elbows glued to my sides, arms waving around like crazy water wheels.\nSo late in life it is unsurprising I admire and enjoy elite sporting achievement.\nWhich is why I spent a considerable amount of money for my nieces and I to revel in the fun spectacle of a Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\nThat was then this is now.\nThat picture makes me rage, International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach is here to ensure the IOC's will, is Japan Government and by association it people bends to his will, the Japanese people will do what is required.\nThat Thomas Bach bidding.\nThat must never be allowed to happen.\nThe ghastly spectacle of this man waving from his chauffeur driven vehicle at the j tax payer expense knowing full well that Japan people health and well being are basically cannon fodder so this Tokyo Games will maintain the IOC revenue stream.\nThis is callous, cruel and reprehensible act of greed.\nThe 2020 Crazy Game, have to stop now.  If this takes acts of democratic peaceful civil disobedience, then so be it.\nProbably in anticipation to the upcoming fiasco, I\u2019ve seen some posts here lately trying to exonerate JGOV as its hands were supposedly tied by the IOC contract. Well, as it\u2019s been said many times already, I don't think that the IOC would have pressed charges against Japan, as the PR damage would have been very high. I also think it was a very convenient thing to say for JGOV.\nBut my point is that the financial penalty for Japan to pull out of the Games, roughly $5bn, was only about 0.1 % of its GDP. Why would JGOV not choose that option when experts said there were important risks to the public health? If you scale this 0.1% down to a household making JPY 5 million in annual revenues, that\u2019s JPY5,000, the price of a parking ticket. Would you take ANY health-related risk for you and the rest of your household for so little money? Of course not. They did. Why?\nThe only reason I can see is that Japanese top politicians and businessmen have huge financial interests. If you rob a bank, it\u2019s always easier with an accomplice inside.\nIt\u2019s not only Japan, it\u2019s just the IOC business model, repeated every four years.\nLets take this at face value, International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach fake 3 day five star hotel isolation, will be followed by threats and intimidation of contractual law.\nThe real world risk to a population that only 15% have been fully vaccinated, Bach has never had to face. Learn from UK mistakes that cost the live of close to 129,000 souls\nThink about this.\nThe J health care system collapsing as his plane leaves the tarmac.\nJ Government must grab this charlatan illywhacker  by the lapels and hold him responsible.\nThere will no Looney Olympics, and Bach/IOC pay the price financially.\nHe should quarantine for a fortnight.\nEven our PM had to when he came back to Australia from the G7 last month.\nThe optics look bad. Who would\u2019ve thought he would get such a frosty welcome?\nPim, there is no direct route to enforcing this contract.\nThe IOC will attempt to, or face bankruptcy.\nThese are unprecedented times, a global pandemic, the ramifications clearly evident, 4 million lives lost.\nA country has a duty to protect its people. The IOC has no political influence, or moral authority,\nThe J Government can just slam the door shut.\nThe contract is not in any mean a treaty by any stretch of the imagination.\nThe question remains there is no court outside of Japan that the J Government recognizes.\nYou are correct there are vested J corporate interests that would financially benefit to proceed with the 2020 crazy games.\nHowever, that will evaporate over night, if the numbers of the infected reflect on the death toll.\nPim, there is no direct route to enforcing this contract.\nThere is. An arbitration clause.\nThe Japanese boo-birds are conveniently forgetting when their compatriots were hugging, crying and high-fiving each other when Tokyo won the right to bring the Games to that city in 2013. Not only is it the biggest sporting event of the year, it is also the responsibility of Japan to honor its contractual agreement with the IOC to host The Olympics.\nYep; take the tears with the smiles.\nActually, though, it is not Japan's responsibility, it is Tokyo's, to honor its contractual agreement with the IOC.\nRegardless--I want to watch in person. Being fully vaccinated I have no fear of sitting outside with other fully vaccinated spectators.\n> International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for the Olympics as the Japanese capital battles a spike in coronavirus infections and the likelihood increases that there will be no spectators in the stands when the games start in just two weeks' time.\nWe left when he arrived.  Too bad he did not take a photo of us waving.\n> International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for the Olympics as the Japanese capital battles a spike in coronavirus infections and the likelihood increases that there will be no spectators in the stands when the games start in just two weeks' time.\nWe will not be spectators for sure.\nI hope he chokes on some mochi.\nQuote from above.\nThe IOC president arrived at Tokyo's Haneda airport, a day after the Japanese government informally decided to place the capital under another state of emergency until Aug. 22, amid rising concern that the Olympics could trigger a further surge in infections.\nSo what the Sam Hill is an \"informal state of emergency.\"  Is it like wearing flip fops and shorts to the office?  Or is more like a clothing optional beach?  More to the point:  can you drop the mask when you go to a bar?\nI am wondering where Koike and company stashed their brain lately.  A state of emergency says we're in dire straits.  Like disease is all around us.  There is nothing information about the pandemic."

                    "value": "Japan is set to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo through August 22 to contain a new wave of coronavirus infections, a key minister said on Thursday, as the organisers consider banning all spectators from the Olympics starting in about two weeks.\nMedical advisers to the government have said for weeks that having no spectators at the Games would be the least risky option amid widespread public concern that the influx of thousands of athletes and officials will fuel a fresh wave of infections.\nOrganisers have already banned overseas spectators and have for now set a cap on domestic viewers at 50 percent of capacity, up to 10,000 people. Talks to finalise the restrictions on the spectators are expected either on Thursday or on Friday.\nThe talks would be presided over by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, who arrives in Tokyo on Thursday to oversee the last leg of the preparations.\nJapan's economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who heads the government's coronavirus response, said a state of emergency in Tokyo is set to begin on July 12, after new daily infections rose to 920 on Wednesday, the highest level since mid-May.\nA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.\nThere are broadly four types of vaccine \u2014 one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.\nVaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.\nThe Tokyo area is currently under slightly less strict \"quasi emergency\" curbs. Under the heightened restrictions, restaurants will be asked to stop serving alcohol, Nishimura said.\nThe move is expected to be made official later on Thursday and followed by a news conference by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.\nAreas neighbouring Tokyo where some Olympic events are also slated to take place, such as Chiba and Kanagawa, are set to remain under \"quasi emergency\" through August 22.\nThe Olympic Games are scheduled to run from July 23 to Aug. 8.\nUntil this week, officials have insisted they could organise the Games safely with some spectators, but a ruling party setback in a Tokyo assembly election on Sunday, which some allies of Suga attributed to public anger over the Olympics, had forced the change of tack, sources said.\nCopyright \u00a9 e-Eighteen.com Ltd All rights resderved.

                    "value": "The Tokyo Olympics will happen later this month amid a state of emergency, and without fans at events in the host city.\nThe Japanese government on Thursday announced that it would re-institute strict measures to counter COVID-19 surges in the capital. The measures will take effect next week, and last the duration of the Games.\nHours after the announcement, Olympic organizers walked back a previous decision to allow local spectators to attend events. Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee president Seiko Hashimoto announced at a late-night press conference that there will be no fans at competitions held in Tokyo and other areas affected by the state of emergency.\nOrganizers have not yet made final decisions on whether they'll bar fans from events held elsewhere around the country. Some soccer, baseball and softball games, among other events, will be held in regions not covered by the emergency measures. In those regions, \"local government authorities will meet and decide specific measures in consultation with the local governors based on the situation in each area\", organizers said in a statement.\nThe vast majority of events, however, are in Tokyo and will be staged behind closed doors.\nOn Wednesday, 16 days before the July 23 Opening Ceremony, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases, over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top government medical advisor, said Wednesday that \"infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it.\"\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga vowed to \u201cdo everything we can to prevent the further spread of the infections.\u201d One day later, citing rising case counts and the more infectious Delta variant, he declared the state of emergency, which will extend through Aug. 22, two weeks after the Olympics end.\nOrganizers have said, though, that the Games can and will go on in a state of emergency. Tamayo Marukawa, Japan's minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, reiterated that commitment Thursday. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach did as well, hours after arriving in Tokyo as scheduled.\n\"I think we can all be very satisfied that the strict measures, having been established to protect everybody \u2014 the Japanese people and the participants of the Games \u2014 have proven to be successful,\" Bach said from his hotel room, where, due to those strict measures, he'll be quarantining for three days.\nTokyo's seven-day COVID-case average had fallen in late May and early June, to fewer than 400 cases per day in a city of millions. The decline led government officials to peel back their previous state of emergency, and eased any lingering fears in the Olympic world that the Games might be postponed again or canceled.\nThat seven-day average, however, has been slowly but steadily climbing since June 18, two days before the previous state of emergency was lifted. Some targeted restrictions remained in place, leaving some sectors of public life under a quasi-state of emergency. But the virus lingered, and over the past 10 days showed signs of accelerating. The test positivity rate rose from under 4% in mid-June to over 6% this week. Hospitalizations are also rising.\nTransmission rates remain far lower than they ever were at the pandemic's peak in the U.S. But with most Japanese still unvaccinated \u2014 less than 30% has received at least one dose \u2014 officials and citizens have been wary of exponential spread, and of the possibility that the Olympics could contribute to it.\nOlympic organizers have outlined and plan to enforce a complex web of COVID countermeasures that will limit contact between Olympic participants and non-participant Japanese citizens. The measures won't completely eliminate that contact, but all \"Level 1\" participants \u2014 athletes, coaches, team officials and more \u2014 will be tested daily. Testing frequency for others will depend on how often they interact with Level 1 participants. The testing will greatly limit spread in and around the Olympic bubble.\nThe Japanese concerns, though, extend beyond that bubble. One is that the Games would lead to dense gatherings of local citizens. Organizers have barred foreign fans from traveling to Tokyo, but in late June, one day after the previous state of emergency was lifted, announced that venues would open to Japanese spectators at 50% capacity, up to 10,000 per event.\nIn doing so, organizers defied the advice of Omi, the government medical advisor, who had recommended a ban on all spectators and warned of \"continuing risks of a resurgence of the infections that puts pressure on [Japan's] medical systems.\u201d\nIn announcing the decision, though, organizers left leeway for reconsideration. \"In the event that a state of emergency or other priority measures aimed at preventing infection are implemented at any time after July 12,\" they said, \"restrictions on spectator numbers at the Games, including non-spectator competitions, will be based on the content of the state of emergency or other relevant measures in force at that time.\"\nAnd on Thursday, at a meeting of leaders of the IOC, the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, the Japanese and Tokyo governments and others, they indeed reconsidered.\nPrior to the pandemic, organizers had projected some $800 million in ticket revenue.

                    "value": "Ryota Yamagata is looking forward to the Tokyo Olympics despite the COVID-19 pandemic. (0:27)\nTOKYO -- International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach arrived in Tokyo on Thursday just as a ban on spectators at the Tokyo Olympics is likely after Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a state of emergency because of rising coronavirus cases in the capital.\nSuga said the state of emergency would go in effect on Monday and last through Aug. 22. This means the Olympics, opening on July 23 and running through Aug. 8, will be held entirely under emergency measures. The Paralympics open on Aug. 24.\n\"Taking into consideration the impact of the delta strain, and in order to prevent the resurgence of infections from spreading across the country, we need to step up virus prevention measures,\" Suga said in announcing the emergency measures.\nBach largely avoided cameras at Tokyo's Haneda Airport and, on a rainy afternoon, went to the IOC's games headquarters in Tokyo, a five-star hotel in the center of the city. He reportedly must self-isolate for three days.\nBach's arrival comes just two weeks before the postponed Tokyo Games are to open. The IOC and local organizers are attempting to hold the Games during a pandemic despite opposition from the Japanese public and the medical community.\nThe main focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlors serving alcohol to close. A ban on serving alcohol is a key step to tone down Olympic-related festivities and keep people from drinking and partying. Tokyo residents are expected to face stay-at-home requests and watch the Games on TV from home.\n\"How to stop people enjoying the Olympics from going out for drinks is a main issue,\" Health minister Norihisa Tamura said.\nThe present state of emergency ends Sunday. Tokyo reported 896 new cases on Thursday, up from 673 a week earlier. It's the 19th straight day that cases have topped the mark set seven days prior. New cases on Wednesday hit 920, the highest total since 1,010 were reported on May 13.\nFans from abroad were months ago banned from attending the Olympics. But just two weeks ago, organizers and the IOC decided to allow venues to be filled to 50% of capacity but crowds not to exceed 10,000. The state of emergency will force them to change plans again with a decision probably coming later on Thursday.\nThe soaring cases are likely to mean that venues will be without any spectators, although sponsors and others may have access. The no-fan atmosphere could include the opening ceremony at the $1.4 billion National Stadium.\nThe uptick in infections also has forced the Tokyo city government to pull the Olympic torch relay off capital streets, allowing it to run only on remote islands off the Tokyo coast. It's unclear how the torch will enter the stadium for the opening ceremony.\n\"The infections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand the seriousness of it,\" Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser, said.\nHe urged authorities to quickly take tough measures ahead of the Olympics, with summer vacations approaching.\nOmi has repeatedly called for a ban on spectators, and has said it's \"abnormal\" to hold the Olympics during a pandemic.\nSeparately, a government COVID-19 advisory panel met Wednesday and expressed concerns about the ongoing resurgence of the infections.\n\"Two-thirds of the infections in the capital region are from Tokyo, and our concern is the spread of the infections to neighboring areas,\" said Ryuji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.\nThe Olympics are pushing ahead against most medical advice, partially because the postponement stalled the IOC's income flow. It gets almost 75% of its income from selling broadcast rights, and estimates suggest it would lose $3 billion to $4 billion if the Olympics were canceled.\nAbout 11,000 Olympians and 4,400 Paralympians are expected to enter Japan, with tens of thousands of officials, judges, administrators, sponsors, broadcasters and media also entering. The IOC says more than 80% of residents of the Olympic Village will be vaccinated.\nNationwide, Japan has had about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15% of Japanese are fully vaccinated, still low compared with 47.4% in the United States and almost 50% in Britain."

That compares with 714 last Wednesday and is the highest total since 1,010 were reported on 13 May. It announced 896 new cases on Thursday.\n\u201cTaking into consideration the effect of coronavirus variants and the need to prevent infections from spreading to the rest of the nation again, we need to strengthen our countermeasures,\u201d Suga said. \u201cGiven the situation, we will issue a state of emergency for Tokyo.\u201d\nWeeks of quasi-emergency measures targeting Tokyo\u2019s night-time economy have failed to prevent the latest wave of cases. The government will reimpose an unpopular ban on serving alcohol at bars and restaurants, which will also have to close early.\nThe emergency declaration in Tokyo \u2013 the centre of Japan\u2019s outbreak for much of the pandemic \u2013 is an embarrassment for Suga, whose handling of the crisis saw his party perform badly in Tokyo metropolitan assembly elections last weekend.\n\u201cPolitically speaking, having no spectators is now unavoidable,\u201d a ruling party source told Reuters.\nSuga\u2019s insistence that organisers and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will be able to stage a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Olympics even as cases rise in the host city could further anger voters just a few months out from a general election.\nThe IOC and the Tokyo 2020 organising committee said last month that attendances would be capped at 50% of a venue\u2019s capacity, or a maximum of 10,000 people.\nBut Suga and the organising committee\u2019s president, Seiko Hashimoto, said a ban on fans was also an option, depending on the number of virus cases in the host city.\nMedical advisers have said that having no spectators at the Games would be the least risky option, amid public concern that the arrival of tens of thousands of athletes, officials, sponsors reports and support staff could trigger a new wave of infections.\nHaving banned overseas sports fans, the Olympic movement was pinning its hopes on a limited number of Japanese spectators creating a semblance of atmosphere.\nBut with the opening ceremony just two weeks away, it is looking more likely that competitions will take place in empty venues, including the opening ceremony at the new $1.4bn national stadium. IOC officials and sponsors, however, could attend in their role as \u201corganisers\u201d, media reports have said.\nThursday\u2019s talks between the IOC, organisers and Japanese government officials will include the IOC\u2019s president, Thomas Bach, who arrived in Tokyo to oversee the last phase of preparations.\nBach, who is reportedly self-isolating at his five-star hotel for three days, and other senior IOC officials have drawn criticism for insisting the Games will go ahead regardless of case numbers and pressure on medical services in Tokyo.\nEarlier this year, John Coates, an IOC vice-president who is overseeing preparations, said the Games could \u201cabsolutely\u201d be held even if Tokyo were under a state of emergency.\nSuga has backed the IOC\u2019s push to stage the Games, despite widespread opposition among the Japanese public and warnings from his own chief medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, that the Olympics \u2013 combined with the summer holidays and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant \u2013 could lead to a surge in infections.\n\u201cInfections are in their expansion phase and everyone in this country must firmly understand how serious that is,\u201d Omi told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe period from July to September is the most critical time for Japan\u2019s Covid-19 measures.\u201d\nJapan has reported about 810,000 cases and nearly 14,900 deaths. Only 15% of the population is fully vaccinated, compared with 47.4% in the US and over 50% in Britain."

                    "value": "TOKYO \u2014 Fans are banned from the Tokyo Olympics following a state of emergency aimed at containing rising coronavirus infections in the capital.\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced the state of emergency. The International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers followed by banning local fans from the Olympics. Fans from aboard were banned months ago.\n\"Many people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said after meeting with IOC and Japanese organizers on Thursday.\nThe emergency declaration was made the same day as the arrival in Japan for IOC President Thomas Bach. He will spend three days in self-isolation at the five-star hotel that lodges IOC members.\n\u2014 Follow more of AP's pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic  and https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea's spy agency has told lawmakers there's no sign that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been inoculated against the coronavirus and his country hasn't received any foreign vaccines.\nLawmakers who attended the closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service say North Korea's government is trying to dispel any expectations among ordinary citizens that they'll receive vaccines from abroad. It's urging them to boost their anti-virus vigilance.\nThey added the spy agency says Kim doesn't appear to have any health problem despite his recent weight loss, which may have been from a diet to improve his health.\nTAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan has received 1.13 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Japan in the second such donation this year.\nThe nation has benefited from vaccine diplomacy, receiving near 5 million doses from the United States and Japan following its worst outbreak starting in May.\nTaiwan has also accused China, which claims the self-ruled island as its renegade territory, of intervening to block the delivery of vaccines. China denies it.\nTaiwan had signed commitments to purchase more than 29 million doses of vaccines, but given global supply constraints and manufacturing delays, it was left with only about 700,000 doses when the number of cases rose sharply in May.\nThe allies of Taiwan have stepped in, enabling the island to start distributing the shots quickly. About 11% of the population have received at least one shot.\nLONDON \u2014 Britain's transportation secretary says starting in mid-July, fully vaccinated U.K. residents returning to England from most countries will no longer have to quarantine after their journey.\nGrant Shapps told lawmakers the change begins July 19. Travelers still must take a coronavirus test three days before returning to the U.K., and within two days after their arrival.\nShapps also confirmed that children under 18 years old won't need to quarantine after travelling. The changes don't apply to non-U.K. residents. On July 19, the government will scrap guidance against people traveling to countries on the \"amber list,\" such as the U.S. and Spain.\nCurrently, people are advised not to fly to those countries unless it is for business or other exceptional circumstances and need to isolate for 10 days after their trips. Shapps says there's no change to the hotel quarantine requirement for those arriving from \"red list\" countries such as India and South Africa, even when they are fully vaccinated.\nLUXEMBOURG \u2014 Luxembourg's prime minister has left the hospital after four days of tests and treatment for a persistent case of COVID-19 that forced him to delegate some of his work.\nThe Luxembourg government says \"because of the improvement of his health,\" Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will reclaim his full functions as prime minister on Friday. Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna had taken over some of the 48-year-old prime minister's duties earlier in the week.\nWhile hospitalized, Bettel was diagnosed with insufficient oxygen saturation. He also had coughing, headaches and a fever. Bettel received his first coronavirus vaccine in May and was scheduled to get his second AstraZeneca shot on July 1.\nTOKYO \u2014 International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has arrived in Tokyo as Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihde Suga announced a state of emergency that could result in a ban on fans at the games.\nThe state of emergency will run Monday through Aug. 22. Suga says it's needed to \"prevent the resurgence of the future spread on cases across the country.\"\nTokyo reported 920 new cases on Wednesday, up from 714 a week earlier. Only 15% of the Japanese population are fully vaccinated.\nThe focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlors serving alcohol to close. Tokyo residents are expected to face stay-home requests and watch the games on TV from home.\nThe IOC and local organizers are attempting to hold the games during a pandemic despite opposition from the Japanese public and medical community. The postponed Tokyo Olympics are set to open on July 23.\nBERLIN \u2014 German authorities say more than 40% of the population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\nHowever, the pace of the country's vaccination campaign has eased off. Calls are growing for more creative efforts to reach people who haven't made appointments to get inoculated, ranging from vaccinations at events to an incentive lottery offering prizes.\nGermany's disease control center says more than 33.9 million people \u2014 40.8% of the population \u2014 are fully vaccinated. Nearly 47.9 million \u2014 57.6% of the population \u2014 have received at least one shot.\nThe government wants people to get vaccinated because of the risk posed by the more contagious delta variant, which is now dominant among Germany's relatively low number of new cases.\nThe disease control center says there were an average 710,000 vaccinations per day last week, down from 800,500 a week earlier.\nLONDON -- A closely monitored coronavirus infection survey indicates that men gathering to watch England's progress in soccer's European Championship may be a reason why women were less likely to test positive for the virus in recent days.\nInterim findings covering June 24 to July 5 from Imperial College London and polling firm Ipsos Mori showed infections quadrupled since the previous so-called React-1 study. According to the survey, one in 170 people in England is infected, and there was a recent doubling time of six days.\nProfessor Paul Elliott, director of the React program at Imperial's School of Public Health, said the prevalence of the virus also was higher in men \u2014 0.7% against 0.5% for women. He speculated that men gathering at homes and pubs to watch the Euros was one reason for the trend.\nThe study was conducted before tens of thousands of spectators watched England beat Denmark 2-1 in a semifinal match on Wednesday evening at London's Wembley Stadium. England's win prompted scenes of wild jubilation elsewhere as fans celebrated the national team making its first final in a major tournament since the 1966 World Cup. In Sunday's final, England will play Italy, again at Wembley.\nSYDNEY \u2014 Australia is attempting to accelerate its sluggish COVID-19 vaccination rollout by encouraging Sydney residents to get their second AstraZeneca shot after two months instead of three.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday he encouraged people to take a second dose of AstraZeneca after two months given a growing cluster of the delta variant that has locked down Sydney for at least three weeks.\nOnly 10% of Australians over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated. That combined with Australia recording fewer than 31,000 confirmed cases since the pandemic began leaves the population particularly vulnerable to the delta variant, which was first identified in India and is thought more contagious than the original virus and other variants.\nSydney reported on Thursday 38 new cases involving the delta variant in the latest 24-hour period. That was the largest daily tally since a cluster emerged after a limousine driver tested positive on June 16. He is thought to have been infected while transporting a U.S. flight crew from Sydney airport. Around 400 cases are now linked to that driver.\nAustralian-manufactured AstraZeneca was supposed to become the backbone of Australia's vaccination program when its rollout began in March. AstraZeneca was initially recommended for all adults in two doses 12 weeks apart.\nThe vaccine is now only recommended in Australia for adults over age 60 after two women aged 48 and 52 died from rare blood clots that were blamed on AstraZeneca's product.\nISLAMABAD-- Britain says it will provide a new package of genomic sequencing support to help Pakistan's fight against new variants of the coronavirus.\nAccording to a statement released by the British Embassy, Pakistan will be able to draw on U.K. expertise and support to detect quickly new and potentially more dangerous virus variants.\nUnder an agreement with Pakistan announced Thursday,, the U.K. will share its expertise and will provide reagents - a substance that causes a chemical reaction in test tubes - and other technical support to Pakistan to increase the country's genomic sequencing capacity.\nThe latest development comes amid a steady surge in CONVID-19 cases in Pakistan.\nSince last year, Pakistan has reported 967,633 confirmed cases and 22,493 virus-related deaths.\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 Fiji's medical system is showing signs of strain as a coronavirus outbreak grows. The Pacific island nation reported a record 791 new daily cases and three deaths.\nThe Ministry of Health says that due to the increase in cases, it will no longer test people for the virus in their homes in and around the capital. The ministry has also suspended all pregnancy services in and around Suva until July 26, saying people experiencing pregnancy emergencies or labor should go directly to Colonial War Memorial Hospital.\nFiji has reported 59 deaths since the outbreak of the delta variant in April, although officials aren't counting 19 of those as virus fatalities because the patients had serious pre-existing conditions. Home to 940,000 people, Fiji had reported just two COVID-19 deaths before that.\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported its biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic as long lines snake around testing stations in the capital, where the virus has accelerated following months of complacency.\nThe 1,275 new cases announced Thursday marked the second straight day above 1,200 and exceeded the previous one-day record of 1,240 set Christmas Day.\nMore than 1,000 of the infections were in the greater Seoul area, which is home to half the country's 51 million people.\nThe viral surge is a worrisome development in a country where 70% of the people are still waiting for their first vaccine shot.\nThe country has struggled to maintain public vigilance with warmer temperatures and months of fatigue luring larger crowds to restaurants, bars and parks.\nPORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Health officials in Maine say more than half the eligible population is now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in every county in the state.\nMaine has one of the highest vaccination rates in the U.S. More than two-thirds of people age 12 and older are fully vaccinated.\nData from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services show that the state's highest vaccination rate is in Cumberland County, which is the state's most populated as home to Portland. The rate there is about 80%.\nThe county with the lowest rate of eligible people fully vaccinated is Somerset, a mostly rural area where the rate is about 53%. That's still a higher number than many states.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 At least nine people who work at the California state Capitol have contracted the coronavirus, triggering a return of the mask mandate for lawmakers and staff.\nMasks have been required in public spaces inside the Capitol throughout the pandemic. But fully vaccinated lawmakers and staff had been allowed to remove their masks in their offices.\nFour of the new cases at the Capitol are people who were fully vaccinated.\nState data shows such cases are rare. The state has confirmed just 8,699 coronavirus infections among the more than 20 million people vaccinated in the state.\n\u00a9 2021 StarTribune. All rights reserved."

Under the heightened restrictions, restaurants will be asked to stop serving alcohol, Nishimura said.\nThe move is expected to be made official later on Thursday and followed by a news conference by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.\nAreas neighbouring Tokyo where some Olympic events are also slated to take place, such as Chiba and Kanagawa, are set to remain under \"quasi emergency\" through August 22.\nThe Olympic Games are scheduled to run from July 23 to Aug 8.\nUntil this week, officials have insisted they could organise the Games safely with some spectators, but a ruling party setback in a Tokyo assembly election on Sunday, which some allies of Suga attributed to public anger over the Olympics, had forced the change of tack, sources said.\nJapan will hold a parliamentary election later this year and the government's insistence that the Games - postponed last year as the virus spread around the world - should go ahead this year could cost it at the ballot box, they said.\nAny unauthorised use or reproduction of bdnews24.com content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action."

Tokyo - which had been counting on a record boom in tourism - has experienced none of the buzz and excitement that normally characterise host cities.\nTokyo\u2019s neighbouring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba will also not allow spectators at their Olympic events, the government said.\nThe government\u2019s drive to hold the Olympics even as the epidemic worsens has alienated much of the Japanese public and sparked concern among sponsors about a consumer backlash.\nSuga said COVID-19 infections were on the rise in Tokyo, due in part to the Delta variant, warning that that it could hit the rest of the country.\n\u201cWe absolutely must avoid Tokyo being the starting point again of another spread of the infection,\u201d he told a news conference, adding that Japan\u2019s vaccination programme was making \u201cgood progress\u201d.\nNew daily cases in Tokyo could increase to 1,000 in July and 2,000 in August, raising the risk of hospitals in the capital region running out of beds, according to recent projections from Yuki Furuse, a Kyoto University professor working with the government\u2019s coronavirus experts group.\nJapan has not suffered the kind of explosive COVID-19 outbreaks seen in many other countries but has had more than 810,000 cases and 14,900 deaths.\nA slow vaccine rollout has meant only a quarter of the population has had at least one shot.\nThe new state of emergency in Tokyo, under which restaurants will be asked to stop serving alcohol, will begin on Monday and run through to Aug 22. It was announced as the capital reported 896 new daily infections on Thursday, near highs last seen in mid-May.\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, who chaired Thursday\u2019s talks after arriving in Tokyo earlier in the day, told reporters that strict measures were in place and those were successful.\nUnderscoring the last-minute nature of Olympic preparations, which had left sponsors frustrated, organisers presented various spectator scenarios to sponsors as late as Wednesday, according to sources.\nSponsors were told that in the case of no spectators, all sports and opening and closing ceremonies would likely be held without fans, meaning tickets allocated to sponsors could not be used.\nThe absence of crowds will likely further strain the Games' budget here, which has already blown out to an estimated $15.4 billion, with ticket revenues of about $815 million expected to dwindle to close to zero.\nUntil this week, officials have insisted they could organise the Games safely with some spectators, but a ruling party setback in a Tokyo assembly election on Sunday, which some allies of Suga attributed to public anger over the Olympics, had forced the change of tack, sources said.\nJapan will hold a parliamentary election this year and the government\u2019s insistence that the Games should go ahead this year could cost it at the ballot box, they said.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers followed by banning local fans from the Olympics. Fans from aboard were banned months ago.\n\u201cMany people were looking forward to watching the games at the venues, but I would like everyone to fully enjoy watching the games on TV at home,\u201d Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said after meeting with IOC and Japanese organizers on Thursday.\nThe emergency declaration was made the same day as the arrival in Japan for IOC President Thomas Bach.

It's urging them to boost their anti-virus vigilance.\nThey added the spy agency says Kim doesn\u2019t appear to have any health problem despite his recent weight loss, which may have been from a diet to improve his health.\nTAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan has received 1.13 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Japan in the second such donation this year.\nThe nation has benefited from vaccine diplomacy, receiving near 5 million doses from the United States and Japan following its worst outbreak starting in May.\nTaiwan has also accused China, which claims the self-ruled island as its renegade territory, of intervening to block the delivery of vaccines. China denies it.\nTaiwan had signed commitments to purchase more than 29 million doses of vaccines, but given global supply constraints and manufacturing delays, it was left with only about 700,000 doses when the number of cases rose sharply in May.\nThe allies of Taiwan have stepped in, enabling the island to start distributing the shots quickly. About 11% of the population have received at least one shot.\nLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s transportation secretary says starting in mid-July, fully vaccinated U.K. residents returning to England from most countries will no longer have to quarantine after their journey.\nGrant Shapps told lawmakers the change begins July 19. Travelers still must take a coronavirus test three days before returning to the U.K., and within two days after their arrival.\nShapps also confirmed that children under 18 years old won\u2019t need to quarantine after travelling. The changes don\u2019t apply to non-U.K. residents. On July 19, the government will scrap guidance against people traveling to countries on the \u201camber list,\u201d such as the U.S. and Spain.\nCurrently, people are advised not to fly to those countries unless it is for business or other exceptional circumstances and need to isolate for 10 days after their trips. Shapps says there\u2019s no change to the hotel quarantine requirement for those arriving from \u201cred list\u201d countries such as India and South Africa, even when they are fully vaccinated.\nLUXEMBOURG \u2014 Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister has left the hospital after four days of tests and treatment for a persistent case of COVID-19 that forced him to delegate some of his work.\nThe Luxembourg government says \u201cbecause of the improvement of his health,\u201d Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will reclaim his full functions as prime minister on Friday. Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna had taken over some of the 48-year-old prime minister\u2019s duties earlier in the week.\nWhile hospitalized, Bettel was diagnosed with insufficient oxygen saturation. He also had coughing, headaches and a fever. Bettel received his first coronavirus vaccine in May and was scheduled to get his second AstraZeneca shot on July 1.\nTOKYO \u2014 International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has arrived in Tokyo as Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Yoshihde Suga announced a state of emergency that could result in a ban on fans at the games.\nThe state of emergency will run Monday through Aug. 22. Suga says it\u2019s needed to \u201cprevent the resurgence of the future spread on cases across the country.\u201d\nTokyo reported 920 new cases on Wednesday, up from 714 a week earlier. Only 15% of the Japanese population are fully vaccinated.\nThe focus of the emergency is a request for bars, restaurants and karaoke parlors serving alcohol to close. Tokyo residents are expected to face stay-home requests and watch the games on TV from home.\nThe IOC and local organizers are attempting to hold the games during a pandemic despite opposition from the Japanese public and medical community. The postponed Tokyo Olympics are set to open on July 23.\nBERLIN \u2014 German authorities say more than 40% of the population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\nHowever, the pace of the country\u2019s vaccination campaign has eased off. Calls are growing for more creative efforts to reach people who haven\u2019t made appointments to get inoculated, ranging from vaccinations at events to an incentive lottery offering prizes.\nGermany\u2019s disease control center says more than 33.9 million people \u2014 40.8% of the population \u2014 are fully vaccinated. Nearly 47.9 million \u2014 57.6% of the population \u2014 have received at least one shot.\nThe government wants people to get vaccinated because of the risk posed by the more contagious delta variant, which is now dominant among Germany\u2019s relatively low number of new cases.\nThe disease control center says there were an average 710,000 vaccinations per day last week, down from 800,500 a week earlier.\nLONDON -- A closely monitored coronavirus infection survey indicates that men gathering to watch England\u2019s progress in soccer\u2019s European Championship may be a reason why women were less likely to test positive for the virus in recent days.\nInterim findings covering June 24 to July 5 from Imperial College London and polling firm Ipsos Mori showed infections quadrupled since the previous so-called React-1 study. According to the survey, one in 170 people in England is infected, and there was a recent doubling time of six days.\nProfessor Paul Elliott, director of the React program at Imperial\u2019s School of Public Health, said the prevalence of the virus also was higher in men \u2014 0.7% against 0.5% for women. He speculated that men gathering at homes and pubs to watch the Euros was one reason for the trend.\nThe study was conducted before tens of thousands of spectators watched England beat Denmark 2-1 in a semifinal match on Wednesday evening at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. England\u2019s win prompted scenes of wild jubilation elsewhere as fans celebrated the national team making its first final in a major tournament since the 1966 World Cup. In Sunday\u2019s final, England will play Italy, again at Wembley.\nSYDNEY \u2014 Australia is attempting to accelerate its sluggish COVID-19 vaccination rollout by encouraging Sydney residents to get their second AstraZeneca shot after two months instead of three.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday he encouraged people to take a second dose of AstraZeneca after two months given a growing cluster of the delta variant that has locked down Sydney for at least three weeks.\nOnly 10% of Australians over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated. That combined with Australia recording fewer than 31,000 confirmed cases since the pandemic began leaves the population particularly vulnerable to the delta variant, which was first identified in India and is thought more contagious than the original virus and other variants.\nSydney reported on Thursday 38 new cases involving the delta variant in the latest 24-hour period. That was the largest daily tally since a cluster emerged after a limousine driver tested positive on June 16. He is thought to have been infected while transporting a U.S. flight crew from Sydney airport. Around 400 cases are now linked to that driver.\nAustralian-manufactured AstraZeneca was supposed to become the backbone of Australia\u2019s vaccination program when its rollout began in March. AstraZeneca was initially recommended for all adults in two doses 12 weeks apart.\nThe vaccine is now only recommended in Australia for adults over age 60 after two women aged 48 and 52 died from rare blood clots that were blamed on AstraZeneca's product.\nISLAMABAD-- Britain says it will provide a new package of genomic sequencing support to help Pakistan\u2019s fight against new variants of the coronavirus.\nAccording to a statement released by the British Embassy, Pakistan will be able to draw on U.K. expertise and support to detect quickly new and potentially more dangerous virus variants.\nUnder an agreement with Pakistan announced Thursday,, the U.K. will share its expertise and will provide reagents - a substance that causes a chemical reaction in test tubes - and other technical support to Pakistan to increase the country\u2019s genomic sequencing capacity.\nThe latest development comes amid a steady surge in CONVID-19 cases in Pakistan.\nSince last year, Pakistan has reported 967,633 confirmed cases and 22,493 virus-related deaths.\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 Fiji\u2019s medical system is showing signs of strain as a coronavirus outbreak grows. The Pacific island nation reported a record 791 new daily cases and three deaths.\nThe Ministry of Health says that due to the increase in cases, it will no longer test people for the virus in their homes in and around the capital. The ministry has also suspended all pregnancy services in and around Suva until July 26, saying people experiencing pregnancy emergencies or labor should go directly to Colonial War Memorial Hospital.\nFiji has reported 59 deaths since the outbreak of the delta variant in April, although officials aren\u2019t counting 19 of those as virus fatalities because the patients had serious pre-existing conditions. Home to 940,000 people, Fiji had reported just two COVID-19 deaths before that.\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported its biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic as long lines snake around testing stations in the capital, where the virus has accelerated following months of complacency.\nThe 1,275 new cases announced Thursday marked the second straight day above 1,200 and exceeded the previous one-day record of 1,240 set Christmas Day.\nMore than 1,000 of the infections were in the greater Seoul area, which is home to half the country\u2019s 51 million people.\nThe viral surge is a worrisome development in a country where 70% of the people are still waiting for their first vaccine shot.\nThe country has struggled to maintain public vigilance with warmer temperatures and months of fatigue luring larger crowds to restaurants, bars and parks.\nPORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Health officials in Maine say more than half the eligible population is now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in every county in the state.\nMaine has one of the highest vaccination rates in the U.S. More than two-thirds of people age 12 and older are fully vaccinated.\nData from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services show that the state\u2019s highest vaccination rate is in Cumberland County, which is the state\u2019s most populated as home to Portland. The rate there is about 80%.\nThe county with the lowest rate of eligible people fully vaccinated is Somerset, a mostly rural area where the rate is about 53%. That\u2019s still a higher number than many states.\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 At least nine people who work at the California state Capitol have contracted the coronavirus, triggering a return of the mask mandate for lawmakers and staff.\nMasks have been required in public spaces inside the Capitol throughout the pandemic. But fully vaccinated lawmakers and staff had been allowed to remove their masks in their offices.\nFour of the new cases at the Capitol are people who were fully vaccinated.\nState data shows such cases are rare. The state has confirmed just 8,699 coronavirus infections among the more than 20 million people vaccinated in the state.\nCopyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "value": "More than nine out of 10 Americans who died from Covid-19 in the US in June were unvaccinated, according to Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 a statistic that health officials say is especially concerning given the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in some regions and the rise of the Delta variant.\nMaryland reported this week that 100% of those who died from coronavirus there in June had not been vaccinated, while more than 93% of those with new cases or who were hospitalized were similarly unprotected.\nCases are rising in nearly half the states as low vaccination rates are being met with the more transmissible and severe Delta or B.1.617.2, variant, identified in India in December 2020.\nVaccinations administered in the US have shown to be effective against the Delta variant, though it poses serious risks to those who remain unvaccinated.\nThe variant is already the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the country, accounting for more than 50% of all new US cases and up to 80% of cases in some regions, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data released Tuesday.\nJoe Biden has reiterated the urgency behind getting more Americans vaccinated.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get complacent now,\u201d he said during a press briefing. \u201cMillions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected. And because of that, their communities are at risk, their friends are at risk, the people they care about are at risk.\u201d\nFauci, the country\u2019s top public health official, has said that in June, 99.2% of Covid deaths in the US could be attributed to those who are unvaccinated.\nCDC data shows that about 67% of American adults aged 18 or older have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 58% are fully vaccinated.\nThe percentages fell short of Biden\u2019s goal of 70% of adult Americans vaccinated with at least one dose by the Fourth of July.\nVaccination rates vary widely by state and region, with states on the west coast and in the north-east seeing the highest rates, while states in the south are seeing some of the lowest.\nSome vaccine hesitancy appears to be closely tied to political beliefs, with a recent poll showing almost twice as many declared Democrats as Republicans saying they had been vaccinated.\nFor some there is longstanding mistrust of government health programs, and some efforts at public outreach are being hampered by misinformation, spread especially via social media.\n\u201cThe solution is the vaccinations,\u201d said Asa Hutchinson, Republican governor of Arkansas, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re in a race against this Delta variant, which spreads very fast, and every state is going to be faced with this.\u201d\nData has made it clear that the vaccine has worked to dramatically reduce the number of Covid cases and deaths in the country.\nRapid rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine this year prevented an additional 279,000 deaths and 1.25m hospitalizations, according to research from the Commonwealth Fund released on Wednesday.\nBut public health experts warn that the continued spread of the Delta variant could cause another surge in cases.\nLast week, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a recommendation saying that everyone, including those who have been vaccinated, should wear masks indoors in light of the spread of the Delta variant. The recommendation contrasts with guidance from the CDC, which in May said that those who are vaccinated do not have to wear masks indoors.\nStates with below-average vaccination rates have almost triple the rate of new Covid-19 cases compared with states with above-average vaccination rates, according to new data from Johns Hopkins University, CNN reported, and in one example a federal government \u201csurge team\u201d was deployed to south-west Missouri to provide public health support.\nWilliam Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told the Washington Post: \u201cThere are people who still doubt the severity of Covid-19 and the effectiveness of the vaccine \u2026 This is still a serious illness. The vaccines are highly protective against these severe outcomes. This is real.\u201d"

The list also includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname and Uruguay. On Sunday, the Covid-19 death toll in Brazil surpassed 500,000, putting it behind only the United States and India in the total number of deaths.\nThe situation in South America is in sharp contrast with wealthier countries, where government officials have lifted emergency orders that require people to wear masks and practice social distancing.\nColombia has been averaging more than 500 deaths per day since the spring, according to the Colombian Ministry of Health. On Monday, Colombia reported 648 deaths, another record.\nLess than 10 percent of Colombia\u2019s population of about 51 million is fully vaccinated, public health data showed.\nColombia\u2019s surge has steadily been worsening for months.\nIn the spring, Claudia L\u00f3pez, the mayor of Colombia\u2019s capital, Bogot\u00e1, warned residents that they should brace for the \u201cworst two weeks\u201d of their lives.\nThe crisis has exacerbated public anger in Colombia, with demonstrations over a pandemic-related tax overhaul intensifying as the nation grapples with rising infections and deaths.\nThere has also been an uptick in abuses by the national police force, with officers beating, detaining and killing protesters, sometimes opening fire on peaceful demonstrations and shooting tear gas canisters from armored vehicles, according to interviews by The New York Times with witnesses and family members of the dead and injured.\nTotal pop.\n\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration announced the distribution list for the remaining 55 million of the 80 million doses of America\u2019s own vaccine supply President Biden has pledged to send out globally and allocate by the end of June in service of ending the pandemic. Already, we have sent millions of doses to the world, including 2.5 million doses that arrived in Taiwan this weekend and in addition, sharing doses \u2014 In addition to sharing doses from our own vaccine supply, the Biden-Harris administration is committed to working with U.S. manufacturers to produce more vaccine doses to share with the world. And we\u2019ve purchased, as we announced last week, or the week before that, half a billion Pfizer doses to donate to 92 low- and middle-income countries, and members of the African Union.\u201d \u201cIs there any indication that the red tape in this distribution is costing lives at this point? Why is it taking so long?\u201d \u201cWell, first, let me say, we\u2019re committed to allocating those doses. We\u2019ve done exactly that. What we found to be the biggest challenge is not actually the supply. We have plenty of doses to share with the world, but this is a herculean logistical challenge, and we\u2019ve seen that as we\u2019ve begun to implement. So, you know, as we work with countries, we need to ensure that there\u2019s safety and regulatory information shared. Some supply teams need needles, syringes and alcohol pads. Transportation teams need to ensure that there are proper temperature storage, prevent breakage and ensure the vaccine immediately clears customs. So this has not, as you all know, been done before. Sometimes it\u2019s even language barriers that occur as we\u2019re working to get these doses out to countries. So, we have announced today where these doses are going. We will continue to announce as they land on the ground and as they are being shipped. And we\u2019re looking forward to doing that as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThe White House outlined a plan on Monday to allocate 55 million doses of coronavirus vaccine around the world, the remainder of 80 million doses that President Biden pledged to send by the end of June to countries desperate for vaccine.\nMr. Biden has a week and a half to meet his deadline, a task made more difficult as the administration tries to change which manufacturers\u2019 vaccines would be included in the 55 million portion. Production problems at an Emergent BioSolutions factory in Baltimore have forced the administration to revise its initial plan to rely heavily on AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine for that donation. The White House did not specify on Monday which vaccines it would be sharing, but people familiar with the operation have said the administration is working to swap shots made by Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson for AstraZeneca\u2019s.\nThe distribution formula closely followed the one that the White House announced earlier this month for the first 25 million doses in the president\u2019s pledge. Three-fourths of the 55 million doses will go to Covax, an international vaccine sharing initiative that helps less wealthy nations. Of those, 14 million will go to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean; 16 million will be distributed to nations across Asia; and 10 million will be sent to countries in Africa.\nThe remaining one-fourth will be spread among at least two dozen places to help address virus surges, including Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, the Philippines, Vietnam, Iraq, Ukraine, Bosnia, South Africa, the West Bank and Gaza.\nThe donation of 80 million doses pales in comparison to the Biden administration\u2019s plan, announced in early June, to share 500 million doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine within the next 12 months. But with many countries unable to vaccinate even a tiny percentage of their populations, global health officials are pressing the United States to move as quickly as possible to share its vaccine supply.\nThe gap in vaccination rates between rich and poor countries is stark. According to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, high or upper middle countries account for 86 percent of shots administered worldwide while low-income countries account for less than half of one percent.\nThe federal government has purchased far more vaccine than the nation can possibly use, and distributed more than states can promptly administer as the pool of people eager to get vaccinated dwindles. More than 60 million doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are sitting in storage in states across the nation, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe White House said it is still working through a variety of logistical and regulatory issues involved in shipping vaccine overseas, like safely transporting the doses and, at times, having to send related supplies, like syringes and alcohol pads, along with them. It said it will release which specific vaccines are being shared and in what amounts later.\n\u2014 Sharon LaFraniere and Daniel E. Slotnik\nYounger Americans are less likely to be vaccinated than their elders, and factors like income and education may affect vaccine hesitancy, according to two new studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBy May 22, 57 percent of adults had received at least one vaccine dose, the authors of one of the new papers found, but the rate varied considerably by age: Among those who were 65 or older, 80 percent had been at least partially vaccinated, compared with 38 percent of those between 18 and 29.\nSome of the gap in rates could be attributed to the fact that many young adults did not become eligible for vaccination until March or April. But uptake has also been slower among younger Americans, and a substantial proportion of them remain hesitant.\nIf vaccine initiation rates remain stable, by late August, just 58 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds will have been vaccinated, compared with 95 percent of those 65 and up, the researchers found.\nVaccination rates lagged for young men, people living in rural counties and people living in counties where a high share of the population was low-income, uninsured or lacked access to a computer or the internet.\nIn a second study, 24.9 percent of 18- to 39-year-olds surveyed said that they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated. Those who were young, Black, low-income, lacked health insurance, lived outside of metropolitan areas or had lower levels of education were less likely to report being vaccinated or to say that they definitely planned to be vaccinated.\nThe studies highlight the hurdles that remain in improving vaccine coverage, with two weeks to go until President Biden\u2019s self-imposed July 4 deadline for getting 70 percent of adults at least partially vaccinated. In recent weeks, his administration has shifted its approach, moving away from mass vaccination sites and adopting more targeted strategies, including the creation of mobile or pop-up vaccination clinics and on-site vaccination events at Black-owned barbershops.\nThe U.S. vaccination campaign began on Dec. 14. Health care workers, adults who were 75 and older and members of other high risk groups were generally the first to become eligible, though vaccine policies varied from state to state. By April 19, all adults were eligible for the shots. Using vaccination data submitted by the states, a team of C.D.C. researchers analyzed vaccination patterns in various demographic groups.\nThey also calculated the percentage of people in each age bracket who received their first dose during a given week. This vaccine \u201cinitiation rate\u201d was highest for adults 65 and older, peaking during the week of Feb. 7, when 8 percent of adults in that group received their first dose.\nBetween April 19 and May 22, the share of 18- to 29-year-olds who received their first dose fell to 1.9 percent from 3.6 percent.\n\u201cIf the current rate of vaccination continues through August, coverage among young adults will remain substantially lower than among older adults,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nIn the second study, researchers surveyed a nationally representative sample of adults, including 2,726 18- to 39-year olds, between March 5 and May 2. Among those who said they would probably or definitely not get the vaccine, 57 percent said that they did not trust the vaccine, while 56 percent expressed concern about possible side effects and 36 percent said they did not think they needed the shot.\nThe study also pointed to potential strategies for increasing vaccination coverage. Among those who said they were unsure about or would probably get the vaccine, 20 to 40 percent said they would be more likely to get it if they had more information about its safety and effectiveness, if it would prevent them from spreading the virus to family and friends, or if it would allow them to return to normal social activities.\nSee where doses have gone, and who is eligible for a shot in each state.\nMedicaid enrollment rose sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, with nearly 10 million Americans joining the public health coverage program for the poor through January, a government report released Monday shows.\nEighty million people \u2014 more than ever before in the program\u2019s history \u2014 now carry Medicaid coverage, for which states and the federal government share the cost. The new figures demonstrate the program\u2019s increasingly important role not just as a safety net, but as a pillar of American health coverage, with fully a quarter of the population covered under it.\n\u201cThe purpose of Medicaid is for times like this, when there is an economic downturn\u201d said Peggah Khorrami, a researcher with Harvard Chan T.H. School of Public Health, who has studied the program\u2019s enrollment increases during the pandemic. \u201cAs people are losing jobs, that\u2019s where Medicaid comes in and we get people insured that way.\u201d\nThe Affordable Care Act transformed Medicaid from a targeted health care benefit meant to help certain groups of people \u2014 expectant mothers, for example, and those with disabilities \u2014 to a much wider program that provides largely free coverage to most people below a certain income threshold. The exception is in 12 states, mostly in the South, that have resisted expanding Medicaid under the health law to cover all adults with income up to 138 percent of the poverty level, which would be $17,774 for an individual this year.\nThe expansion of Medicaid in most states since the bulk of the A.C.A. took effect in 2014, though, has proved important during the pandemic, creating a public source of coverage for the newly unemployed that did not exist a decade ago. Adult enrollment in Medicaid grew twice as quickly as child enrollment last year, suggesting widespread job loss related to the pandemic created a huge group of newly eligible adults.\nThere are 11 states in the United States where at least 20 percent of older adults still haven\u2019t received a Covid shot, potentially putting the recovery there at risk.\nPeople 65 and older were given top priority for vaccinations because they are far more vulnerable to serious illness and death from the coronavirus than younger people are. Those 65 and older have the highest rate of vaccination among all age groups, with 87 percent having received at least one dose, compared with 60 percent for people ages 18 to 64, and 31 percent for those 12 to 17.\nBut in 11 states, seniors who have yet to get a dose of the vaccine pose a risk to their states\u2019 recovery as most places remove restrictions aimed at limiting new outbreaks.\nMost of them are in the South: Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. Georgia, Idaho and Missouri are at the 20 percent threshold. West Virginia and Wyoming also have more than 20 percent of people 65 and over without one dose.\n\u201cThe 20 percent lines up pretty well with a group of people, especially in the South, who say, \u2018No way, no how am I getting vaccinated,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Michael S. Saag, associate dean for global health and professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nAmong the factors at play, he said: conspiracy theories, a belief in pseudoscience and a libertarian mind-set that says, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d\n\u201cConvincing them that it is in their own interest is a tough nut to crack,\u201d Dr. Saag said. \u201cFor the state of Alabama and other Southern states, this is not for a lack of effort or resources. This is about a population resistant to receiving the message.\u201d\nOlder people, in general, feel more threatened from the coronavirus and more likely to die from it, experts say, and it\u2019s not surprising that they have been among the most receptive to the vaccines. After older age groups were given priority when the first vaccines were authorized for emergency use in December, the proportion of those dying started dropping immediately.\nAcross the United States, those 50 and older continue to make up the bulk of Covid-19 deaths, and the virus continues to kill hundreds of people daily.\nDeath rates remain high in pockets of the nation where vaccination rates are not. Experts are concerned that Southern states, where vaccination rates are lagging, could face a surge in coronavirus cases over the summer.\n\u201cAll epidemics are local at the end of the day, and transmission is person to person,\u201d Dr. Saag said. \u201cThere is going to be a hot pocket of transmission if someone becomes infected and others around them are unvaccinated. This is not Epidemiology 101, this is common sense.\u201d\nLast year, a summer surge lasted until September in the South. This year, many people are vaccinated, and there is residual immunity from those who have already had it, Dr. Saag said.\nWhat\u2019s more worrying for him, he said, is the dropping of mask ordinances as the more infectious Delta variant spreads. U.S. health officials this week classified the Delta variant, which was first found in India, as a \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d sounding the alarm because it spreads rapidly and may cause more serious illness in unvaccinated people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting on a powder keg,\u201d Dr. Saag said.\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll found last month that 10 percent of unvaccinated seniors said that they would \u201cdefinitely not\u201d get inoculated against the coronavirus. But the same poll showed signs that some hesitant people have been persuaded: About a third who had planned to \u201cwait and see\u201d whether they would get vaccinated said that they had made vaccine appointments or planned to do so.\nThe White House is considering extending by one month a federal moratorium on evictions scheduled to expire on June 30, in a bid to buy more time to distribute emergency housing aid, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.\nThe freeze, instituted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last fall to stave off an anticipated wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn during the pandemic, has significantly limited the economic damage to low-income and working-class renters, according to local officials and tenants\u2019 rights groups.\nBut the moratorium was never considered more than a stopgap, and landlords have prevailed in several recent federal court cases challenging the legal justification for the C.D.C.\u2019s order \u2014 the public health risk posed by the dislocation of tenants during the pandemic.\nLocal officials have been bracing for a rise in evictions as the federal moratorium and similar state and city orders expire this summer. In some cases, that scramble to assist tenants has dovetailed with the broader goal of improving affordability that is now a core part of the Democratic Party\u2019s agenda.\nOn Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that the state had set aside $5.2 billion from federal aid packages to pay off the back rent of any tenant who fell behind during the pandemic, an extraordinary move intended to wipe the slate clean for millions of renters in a state dealing with acute homelessness and a housing affordability crisis.\nPresident Biden\u2019s team has been seeking ways to speed up the sluggish distribution of $21.5 billion in emergency rental assistance allocated in the American Recovery Act this spring.\nThe group met throughout the weekend to discuss potential moves, including the idea of pushing back the deadline until the end of July, which has been under consideration for weeks, the officials said.\nBut they have yet to sign off on an extension, in part, over concerns in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office that leaving the freeze in place, even for a month, could expose the order to a ruling that could affect executive actions during future crises, one of the officials said.\nAdministration lawyers are particularly concerned that the Supreme Court will strike down a stay in a lower court decision that ruled the moratorium unconstitutional.\nMr. Biden\u2019s team is pushing ahead with several other actions, including issuing new guidance on using pandemic relief funds that could speed up distribution of payments by states, and increasing coordination with mayors, bar associations and legal services organizations.\nBut tenants\u2019 rights groups say that simply stopping the clock is the most important action.\n\u201cExtending the moratorium is the right thing to do \u2014 morally, fiscally, politically, and as a continued public health measure,\u201d said Diane Yentel, the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, who has pressed the White House for an extension. \u201cAllowing evictions to proceed when there are tens of billions in resources to prevent them would be wasteful and cruel.\u201d\nDomestic spectators will be allowed to attend Olympic events in Tokyo this summer, the president of the Games announced on Monday, ending months of speculation that athletes could be deprived of a live audience in an effort to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.\nThe decision settles the last major logistical issue facing the organizers of the Games, which have been delayed for a year because of the pandemic, all but guaranteeing that the event will go forward despite lingering concerns. Spectators from overseas were barred from attending in March in a major concession to the realities of the pandemic.\nThe president of Tokyo 2020, Seiko Hashimoto, said that the International Olympic Committee had agreed that crowds would be allowed up to 50 percent of a venue\u2019s capacity, up to 10,000 people. However, if the pandemic situation worsens or if emergency measures are declared by the Japanese government, the Games could be held without spectators.\nThe decision to allow people in Japan to attend events indicates a growing certainty that the Tokyo Games, which are scheduled to begin on July 23 and run through Aug. 8, will go on, after months of concern that they could become a superspreader event as athletes and other personnel pour into the city from around the world.\nConcerns have diminished substantially in recent weeks as Japan\u2019s virus case numbers drop and vaccination rates skyrocket. After a slow rollout, the country is now administering nearly one million doses of the vaccine every day. About 18 percent of the population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 7.3 percent are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database.\nNevertheless, worries remain. Japan\u2019s top coronavirus adviser, Shigeru Omi, has consistently warned against allowing spectators, which he believes adds an unnecessary layer of risk. This month, organizers said that about 10,000 of the 80,000 volunteers who signed up to help with the Games had quit, citing fear of infection among their reasons.\nAs recently as May, a poll showed that 83 percent of people in Japan disapproved of plans to go through with the event. But those numbers have turned around along with the improvement in the country\u2019s virus situation.\nOlympic officials said that more than 80 percent of athletes had been vaccinated. Other groups, including staff members, journalists covering the event and some volunteers, will also receive shots.\nConscious of the public\u2019s concerns, Olympic officials have also agreed to strict conditions on the Games. Athletes will be tested regularly for the coronavirus and their movements will be restricted and monitored. Failure to abide by the rules could lead to disqualification or even deportation.\nThe Games will have rules for spectators aimed at reducing the risks of transmission, including mask wearing, a ban on shouting, and specific guidelines on travel to and from venues.\nA panel of expert advisers to the committee told reporters on Friday that the rules were likely to be stricter than those currently in place for other live sporting events, such as baseball.\nAfghanistan\u2019s medical oxygen supply is under serious strain, a government official said on Monday, as the country\u2019s third wave of coronavirus cases pummels its already feeble health care system.\n\u201cThere is more need for oxygen, and the number of patients is too high,\u201d said Dr.\u00a0Osman\u00a0Tahiri, an adviser in Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Public Health. \u201cWe are worried that the situation may become more critical.\u201d\nDr. Tahiri said that the government had tried to contend with dwindling supplies by installing oxygen generators in hospitals in Kabul, the country\u2019s capital, and in provinces across the country. That plan, he said, has been hampered by fighting in several areas.\nThe shortage in oxygen was first reported by The Associated Press.\nThe ministry recorded nearly 2,000 coronavirus cases and more than 70 deaths on Monday, part of an upward trend in the country in recent weeks, driven in part by new variants of the coronavirus. Last week, the government recorded the most deaths in a single day \u2014 101 \u2014 since the start of the pandemic.\nThe true death toll and number of new cases is probably far higher than those recorded by the government, as there is limited coronavirus testing in Afghanistan.\nThe country\u2019s problems extend much further than the recent coronavirus surge, however. This is especially true in the country\u2019s more rural reaches where recent Taliban offensives have wedged many civilians in the crossfire between government and insurgent forces, and a dry winter has precipitated a coming drought.\nIn some cases, road closures and gun battles at a key border crossing on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border have stopped oxygen bottles from getting to hospitals.\n\u201cThe war has affected 100 percent of the oxygen supply and the roads are completely closed,\u201d said Ihsanullah Fazly, director of health in Kunduz, a province in the country\u2019s north that has been racked with fighting in recent days.\nThe conflict and hoarding of oxygen supplies has also led to price gouging.\n\u201cThere is an atmosphere of fear of the virus in the country, so people buy oxygen beforehand, which has led to a lack of oxygen and even multiplied the price of oxygen,\u201d Dr. Tahiri said.\nAhmad Fardin, who works for an oxygen sales company in Kabul, said that empty oxygen bottles once sold for around $20. Now they can cost upward of $150.\n\u201cHundreds of people are waiting behind the gates of oxygen companies to buy oxygen,\u201d he said.\nCanadian citizens and permanent residents who are fully vaccinated will be able to forgo a 14-day quarantine when arriving in the country, the Canadian government announced Monday. The new policy spares them from a polarizing requirement that they stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel.\nThe closure of Canada\u2019s border with the United States to nonessential travel was recently extended to July 21, angering people on both sides of the border who have been irked by family separations and the inability to plan vacations or shopping trips.\nThe Canadian government has defended the hotel quarantine policy, which requires travelers to pre-book a three-day minimum stay at a government-approved hotel \u2014\u00a0at a nonrefundable cost of as much as 2,000 Canadian dollars \u2014 as a necessary measure\u00a0to help keep the coronavirus at bay. Travelers are allowed to finish their quarantine at home once the Covid-19 test they take upon arrival at the airport comes back negative.\nHealth Minister Patty Hajdu said the cautious approach was predicated on the desire to keep Canadians safe and not to \u201csquander\u201d hard-earned progress in the fight against the coronavirus.\nBut critics have castigated the quarantine hotel policy as overly expensive and an encroachment on individual liberty. An advisory panel recently advised scrapping the policy, saying that many Canadians were opting to pay a heavy fine rather than stay in the hotels. Others were choosing to fly to the United States and then enter Canada by car, because the hotel-quarantine policy did not apply to travelers arriving by land.\nThe relaxing of the hotel policy for fully vaccinated Canadian travelers takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on July 5. It was greeted with muted joy, in part because most Canadians are not yet fully vaccinated. Also, the changes do not apply to non-Canadians, including Americans, unless, for example, they are essential-service workers or qualify for another exemption to quarantining.\nAs of June 18, about 4.9 million Canadians, or 13 percent of the population, had been fully vaccinated, and another 19.5 million, or 51 percent, had received the first of two doses, according to data from Canada\u2019s public health ministry. Those figures are expected to rise rapidly once the country obtains larger supplies of vaccine.\nThe lives of many in New York were marked by solitude and alarm during the worst months of the pandemic. But as vaccination rates have climbed, the city\u2019s long hibernation has begun to end.\nWhen some capacity restrictions and mask mandates fell away, neighbors, for the first time in months, greeted one other with bright smiles, no longer struggling to recognize the person behind the mask. Family members and friends reunited with long-sought embraces. Still, some parts of pandemic life \u2014 temperature checks and socially distanced lunch tables \u2014 remained.\nLast week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s order to lift almost all virus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings represented one of the final steps in the city\u2019s reopening. The governor said the new guidance represented a \u201creturn to life as we know it.\u201d\nBut for some, the news was only a symbolic triumph, as the most stringent restrictions had been removed weeks ago. And the decision over whether to do away with precautions lies with individuals and business owners, many of whom said the governor\u2019s announcement would not spur immediate change.\nSome New Yorkers are opting for small gatherings and parties among close friends over bars and nightclubs. And though many vaccinated New Yorkers are no longer wearing masks in public, some say they are not rushing to remove them.\nBoth New York and California celebrated the same milestone this past week: Both states announced that 70 percent of adults had received at least one dose of the vaccine. But inoculation rates remain significantly lower in some pockets of New York, particularly across Brooklyn and the Bronx.\nThe house lights inside Madison Square Garden went down Sunday night, and the thousands of fans, packed like sardines in their seats, stood as if on cue. As they roared their approval, bouncing in place on the balls of their feet, the ground began to tremble. Cellphone flash lights illuminated the darkness.\nThe sound of a keyboard echoed through the rafters. Dave Grohl, the Foo Fighters\u2019 frontman, appeared on the stage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s times like these, you learn to live again,\u201d Grohl sang.\nThe lyrics had seldom felt so on point.\nAfter many difficult months of illness, death, hardship and pain, and shifting limits on how many people could gather, especially indoors, arena rock returned to New York City just over a year after the city was the center of the outbreak. It was the Garden\u2019s first concert in more than 460 days, and it drew a full-capacity crowd that was asked to show proof of vaccination to enter. Inside, people grooved, tightly packed, with few masks visible.\n\u201cThis is a book end to what we have gone through for a year and a half,\u201d said Heather Morris, 47, of Chicago. \u201cWe\u2019ve survived it. We\u2019re going forward.\u201d\nThe government of Qatar has announced that everyone attending the World Cup to be held in the country next year must be fully vaccinated for the coronavirus. And with up to 1.5 million international fans expected to descend on the Gulf nation during the world\u2019s largest soccer tournament next November, the logistics will be no small feat.\nThe Qatari government has plans to secure one million shots to immunize unvaccinated attendees if global inoculation efforts are not enough, the prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa bin Abdulaziz al-Thani, told state news media on Sunday.\n\u201cWe are currently negotiating with a company to provide one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in order to immunize and vaccinate some of those coming to Qatar,\u201d he said, according to Reuters, though he did not indicate which company he was referring to.\nQatar has spent billions of dollars preparing for the 2022 World Cup after winning hosting rights in 2010. The country will become the first in the Middle East to hold the four-week tournament.\nIn April, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, said that vaccination programs were being developed for attendees of the World Cup to ensure a \u201cCovid-free event,\u201d according to Reuters. Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said in February that matches would play to full stadiums in the Gulf nation next year.\nQatar is currently administering the Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna vaccines to its citizens and residents. About 57 percent of the population have received one dose, and 44 percent have been fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by The New York Times.\n\u2014 Aina J. Khan\nFrance announced on Monday that concerts with a standing audience could resume on June 30 and that nightclubs could reopen from July 9, bringing some relief to the country\u2019s entertainment industry, which has been hobbled by the pandemic.\nAlain Griset, a government minister, told reporters on Monday, \u201cIn this new phase where the health crisis begins to subside, we will be able to look forward to this summer in good conditions and to party in complete safety.\u201d\nThe decision comes as France lifts the last remnants of coronavirus-related restrictions that have fueled a deep sense of fatigue in the country, particularly since the start of the third national lockdown this spring. The country\u2019s eight-month nighttime curfew was lifted on Sunday, three days after the government dropped mandatory mask wearing outdoors.\nMr. Griset said that guests would have to show a digital health pass to enter nightclubs. The pass, available in a phone app, shows proof of either vaccination, a positive coronavirus test within the last six months \u2014 but more than two weeks old \u2014 or a recent negative test.\nThe coronavirus situation in France has largely improved in recent weeks, with fewer than 3,000 daily new infections on average. After a sluggish start at the beginning of the year, the country\u2019s vaccination campaign has accelerated and about half of the population has now received at least a first shot of the vaccine. A quarter are fully vaccinated.\nThe authorities in South Australia on Saturday barred entry to the state to travelers from the eastern suburbs of Sydney, in New South Wales, after an outbreak of the coronavirus in that city on the country\u2019s eastern coast. The cluster of cases in Sydney, totaling 11 on Monday, is believed to have started after a limousine driver, whose passengers included international airline crew, tested positive for the more virulent Delta variant. South Australia has also banned travelers from Melbourne, in Victoria State, where an outbreak this month sent the city of five million into a two-week lockdown.\nA member of Uganda\u2019s Olympic team tested positive for the coronavirus after arriving in Japan on Saturday, local news media reported, citing government officials. The person was traveling with eight other athletes, all of whom have so far tested negative, reports said. The case comes amid a scramble to ensure the safety of Olympians before the Tokyo Games begin on July 2.\nIndonesia will introduce new coronavirus restrictions in response to a rise in cases in the country. The rules will be placed on crowded centers including malls and markets, limiting capacity to 25 percent, Airlangga Hartarto, the country\u2019s coordinating minister for economic affairs, told reporters on Monday. Indonesia logged 13,737 new cases on Sunday, the highest since January.\nThe United States extended restrictions on nonessential travel at land and ferry crossings with Canada and Mexico until July 21, the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on Twitter. But the department also said that there had been \u201cpositive developments in recent weeks\u201d and that it was working with government agencies and with Canada and Mexico to identify the parameters under which restrictions could be eased.\nSHANGHAI \u2014 Dozens of huge container ships have been forced to drop anchor and wait. Freight rates have surged. Stores in the United States and Europe find themselves with understocked shelves, higher prices or both.\nThe blockage of the Suez Canal in March? No, there is another disruption in global shipping. This time, the problem lies in Shenzhen, a metropolis adjacent to Hong Kong in southeastern China.\nGlobal shipping has been disrupted by the pandemic for months, as Western demand for goods made in Asia has outstripped the ability of exporters to get their containers onto outbound vessels. But the latest problem in Shenzhen, the world\u2019s third-largest container port after Shanghai and Singapore, is making the difficulties even worse.\nThe shipping delays are related to the Chinese government\u2019s stringent response to a recent outbreak of the virus. Shenzhen, with a population of more than 12 million, has had fewer than two dozen locally transmitted coronavirus cases; city health officials have linked them to the Alpha variant, which was first identified in Britain.\nShenzhen has responded by ordering five rounds of coronavirus testing of all 230,000 people who live anywhere near the Yantian container port, where the first case was detected on May 21. All further contact between port employees and sailors has been banned. The city has required port employees to live in 216 hastily erected, prefabricated buildings at the docks instead of going home to their families every day.\nThe port\u2019s capacity to handle containers plummeted early this month. It was still running at 30 percent below capacity last week, the port announced, and state-controlled media said on Monday that full recovery might require the rest of June.\n\u201cA few weeks into a very substantial port congestion in Yantian caused by a Covid-19 outbreak, supply chain disruptions continue to be very present in global trade,\u201d Maersk, the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, said in a statement on Thursday.\nLong lines of container ships awaiting cargo bound for North America, Europe and elsewhere have had to anchor off Shenzhen and Hong Kong as captains now wait as long as 16 days to dock at Yantian. Small vessels mounted with their own cranes have been ferrying many containers straight from riverfront factory docks in the Pearl River Delta to container ships near Hong Kong, as exporters try to bypass delays at Yantian.\n\u201cIt looks like rush hour \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of ships waiting,\u201d said Tim Huxley, the chairman of Mandarin Shipping, a container shipping line based in Hong Kong. He predicted that sorting out all of the shipping delays at Yantian and elsewhere could take the rest of this year.\nThe Suez Canal was blocked for almost a week by the Ever Given container ship in March, while Yantian coincidentally halted all loading of export containers for six days early this month. But Yantian\u2019s problems have now dragged on much longer. Simon Heaney, the senior manager for container shipping research at Drewry Maritime Research in London, said the global transportation disruption caused by the Yantian port problems was similar to the Suez Canal blockage, although differences between the two incidents make any statistical comparison difficult.\nThe average cost of shipping a 40-foot container from East Asia to Europe or North America has roughly quadrupled in the past year. Rates have soared this month with the Yantian difficulties.\nThe Chinese government accused the United States on Monday of interfering in its internal affairs after Washington shipped 2.5 million doses of Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine to Taiwan, saying that any form of vaccine assistance should not be used as a form of \u201cpolitical manipulation.\u201d\nChina regards Taiwan as its own territory and is acutely sensitive to any form of interaction between the United States and the self-governed democracy. The donations, which were more than triple the original amount that the Biden administration had promised, were celebrated in Taiwan.\nIn Beijing, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, criticized the move.\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. not to use vaccine assistance to engage in political manipulation and not to interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs,\u201d Mr. Zhao said at a regular news briefing.\nThe vaccine donations come at a time when tensions between the United States and China are running high over Taiwan. Chinese officials were annoyed this month when three U.S. senators visited the island to announce the original pledge of 750,000 doses.\nMr. Zhao also took aim at Taiwan\u2019s governing Democratic Progressive Party, headed by President Tsai Ing-wen, which has long been considered a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side. Mr. Zhao said that the party had \u201ctried all means to obstruct the shipment of vaccines from the mainland to Taiwan and even lied that the mainland is obstructing its procurement of vaccines.\u201d\nTaiwan\u2019s leaders had previously blamed \u201cChinese intervention\u201d for their inability to buy doses from the German company BioNTech, which developed its vaccine with Pfizer.\nA Chinese company, Fosun Pharmaceutical, claims the exclusive commercial rights to distribute BioNTech\u2019s vaccine in Taiwan, but for many in the self-governing democracy, the idea of buying shots from a mainland Chinese business is unpalatable.\nThe coronavirus vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may have caused heart problems in more than 1,200 Americans, including about 500 who were younger than age 30, according to data reported on Wednesday by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nStill, the benefits of immunization greatly outweigh the risks, advisers to the C.D.C. said. They strongly recommended vaccination for all Americans 12 and older.\nThe heart problems are myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining around the heart. The risk is higher after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine than the first, and much higher in men than in women. Researchers do not know why.\nBut the side effect is very uncommon, just 12.6 cases per million second doses administered.\nC.D.C. researchers estimated that every million second doses given to boys ages 12 to 17 might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases, but would prevent 5,700 infections, 215 hospitalizations and two deaths.\nAgency researchers presented the data to members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations on vaccine use in the United States. (The scientists grouped together pericarditis and myocarditis for reporting purposes.)\nMost cases were mild, with symptoms like fatigue, chest pain and disturbances in heart rhythm that quickly cleared up, the researchers reported. Of the 484 cases reported in Americans under age 30, the C.D.C. has definitively linked 323 cases to vaccination. The rest remain under investigation.\n\u201cThese events are really very rare, extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Brian Feingold, an expert on heart inflammation in children at the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh. \u201cThat needs to be taken in context with illness and morbidity and mortality related to Covid.\u201d\nSeparately, more than a dozen federal and professional medical organizations said in a joint statement on Wednesday that myocarditis \u201cis an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination.\u201d\nThe C.D.C. advisers met as the Biden administration publicly acknowledged that it expected to fall short of its goal of getting 70 percent of Americans partly vaccinated by July 4. The shortfall, officials said on Tuesday, resulted in part from reluctance among younger Americans to be immunized.\nIt\u2019s unclear what causes myocarditis, or why it is more common in young men than in women. The first cases linked to coronavirus vaccines were reported in Israel, mostly among young men aged 16 to 19 years. Israel recorded 148 cases between December and May, 95 percent of them mild.\nIn the United States, too, myocarditis has been more common in men and boys: Up to 80 percent of cases after the second dose were in males. There has also been a clear age difference, with the side effect clustered in individuals in their late teens and early 20s.\nThe vast majority of patients with myocarditis recovery fully, noted Dr. James de Lemos, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who reported one of the first cases in January.\nCovid-19 itself may cause heart problems in young people. A large study of collegiate athletes showed that 2.3 percent of those who had recovered from Covid-19 had heart abnormalities consistent with myocarditis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be many-fold more common to get heart muscle inflammation from getting Covid than you would from getting a vaccine, even in young men,\u201d Dr. de Lemos said.\nVaccination is becoming an even more urgent priority, given more contagious variants of the coronavirus now circulating in the United States, Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine safety committee, said in an interview.\n\u201cWe are not close to being near where we need to be\u201d in terms of the percentage of the population that should be vaccinated, Dr. Offit said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to head into winter when you\u2019re going to have a generally under vaccinated population.\u201d\nThe Olympics have always been about numbers. After all, a motto of Citius, Altius, Fortius \u2014 Faster, Higher, Stronger \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean much without seconds, meters and pounds. How fast? How high? How strong?\nFor more than a year, though, a different set of numbers has come to dominate discussions about the Tokyo Games: rising coronavirus case counts, escalating risk factors, inadequate vaccination totals.\nDespite those concerns, the Games are almost certain to go forward this summer: The latest evidence was the announcement on Monday that domestic spectators would be allowed to attend Olympic events at reduced capacities.\nSome other numbers may help explain why the Games are still a go, including this eye-popping one: $15.4 billion. If Tokyo\u2019s new national stadium stands empty on the night of the opening ceremony, that will be $15.4 billion in investment mostly down the drain.\nThe figure, a record even for famously oversize Olympic budgets, has swelled $3 billion in the past year alone. The reputational damage to Japan, though, on top of the loss of money, would be incalculable.\nA month before the opening ceremony, The New York Times looked at some of the other big numbers behind the sports numbers still to come."

                    "value": "1.3k\nDelaying the end of lockdown by four weeks could halve the number of people who get admitted to hospital with Covid, SAGE told the Government last week in a meeting that persuaded Boris Johnson to cancel June 21.\nReports from the scientific advisers' meeting and modelling shows that if 'Freedom Day' had gone ahead as planned there could have been a summer peak of more than 200,000 infections per day along with more than 2,000 daily admissions to hospital and over 500 deaths per day.\nThe ghastly predictions warn of a wave to rival the first crisis in March 2020 and close to the second wave, although top researchers are still in the dark about how well vaccines would control this.\nThe Indian 'Delta' variant has turned the lockdown roadmap on its head after measures appeared to be working against the 'Alpha' Kent variant but not strong enough to control the new strain.\nSAGE warned there would be a 'large resurgence in infections and admissions' in any scenario in which lockdown rules were lifted on June 21. It added: 'The scale of this resurgence is highly uncertain, and it could be either considerably smaller or larger than previous waves.'\nEarly data suggest that single vaccine doses are only 33 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid, meaning almost half of adults have inadequate protection, and Boris Johnson has delayed the final step of his roadmap in order to buy time for second vaccines to be given to millions more.\nSAGE clearly lobbied for a delay and said the longer restrictions can stay in place, the more hospital admissions and deaths could be reduced, but added: 'Most of the benefit comes from the first four weeks of delay.'\nThe\u00a0 group, headed up by Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, said: 'This is partly because four weeks is long enough to ensure significantly more vaccination coverage and would push Step 4 close to the school holidays, when transmission is expected to be reduced.'\nBoris Johnson's spokesperson said today that a delay of just a mount would prevent 'thousands of deaths' and added: 'You have a significant proportion of cohorts one to nine who have yet to have second doses, and we have seen a potentially a higher level of hospitalisations. We are seeing below 50s going into hospital.'\nAnalysis by Warwick University modellers showed how daily Covid hospital admissions could hit up to 2,500 a day, if June 21 went ahead. Scientific estimates also showed how the curve of admissions would peak at just over 1,000 a day if Freedom Day was pushed back to July 19. The team also looked at what would happen if the final unlocking took place on August 23\nScientists estimated that a longer delay would flatten the curve and lead to a smaller hike in the number of patients taking up hospital beds with Covid, with the smallest peak if social distancing carried on until December and the highest one if June 21 went ahead. But in the meeting last week they admitted: 'Most of the benefit comes from the first four weeks of delay'\nINFECTIONS: SPI-M warned that the number of people catching the virus each day could spike to more than 250,000 per day over the summer wit the new fast-spreading variant and no lockdown rules. The second wave appeared to peak at a total of 1.1million people being infected at any one time \u2013 daily cases are not accurately measured except through testing, which peaked at around 70,000 a day\nSAGE modelling sub-group SPI-M, the\u00a0Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said that there was no scenario in which they could be confident it was safe to open up the country to normal life next Monday.\nBy July 19, which is the next date earmarked for the lifting of England\u2019s remaining restrictions, officials hope around two thirds of all adults will have been offered both doses of vaccine, ahead of the original schedule for the end of the month.\nAnalysis by Public Health England suggests the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 96% effective against hospitalisation after two doses, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 92% effective after a second jab. Efficacy rates are expected to be high even for the Delta variant but they will be less able to prevent infection.\nScientists and officials do not yet believe it is possible to contain the virus without some social distancing, until more people have been vaccinated. Modelling suggests that had the easing of lockdown not been delayed, hospital admissions could have reached the heights of the first peak in March 2020.\nThis is the main reason why the Prime Minister felt he could not proceed with the June 21 reopening. The Delta variant, first identified in India, is believed to be between 40 and 80 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha strain and twice as likely to lead to hospital admission.\nThere are now around 8,000 new cases a day, the highest since February. In around one third of England, cases are doubling every week.\nUnvaccinated people have twice the risk of hospital admission with the Delta variant as the Alpha variant, while among those who are vaccinated 12 people in every 100 may end up in hospital with Delta compared with eight for Alpha.\nMembers said they still weren't sure how much faster the Delta variant spreads \u2013 although it is thought to be between 40 and 80 per cent, likely 60 \u2013 nor how well vaccines protect against severe disease, or how people would change their behaviour after the roadmap had ended.\nScientists have thought it is unlikely people would immediately return to life as if Covid didn't exist, but if they did it could have disastrous consequences.\nSPI-M said in a report published today: 'In all scenarios modelled, even a short delay to the timing to Step 4 results in a significant drop in the number of people being admitted to hospital as more people are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closer.\n'Even a two-week delay would have a significant effect, but a four-week delay is modelled as reducing the peak in hospital admissions by around a third to a half.\n'A delay would also allow evidence to build up on the effectiveness of vaccines against delta, potentially increasing precision in future modelling scenarios.'\nThe team said that, although hospitals are not under a lot of pressure from Covid right now, this is expected to 'rapidly increase' in the short term.\nAnother 187 people were admitted to hospital with Covid last Tuesday, June 8, the highest figure since April and a spike of a fifth on the previous Tuesday.\nThere are expected to have been even more in the six days since then following in the trail of a huge surge in infections.\nThe amount of hospital admissions that could happen in the next wave of the virus will depend partly on how much faster the variant transmits than the current strain.\nIn the SPI-M modelling the researchers suggested that if the strain were 80 per cent more transmissible \u2013 the upper limit of the team's estimate \u2013 admissions could peak at more than 6,000 per day, higher even than the second wave.\nThe virus is assumed in the models to be around 56 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha Kent variant.\nThe main models presented to SAGE did not estimate the size of future waves of the virus in the autumn or winter because they are uncertain about how the next resurgence will play out.\nThe fact that the next spike is not expected to end in a lockdown means there is a chance the virus will burn out naturally, which could reduce the risk of another huge surge caused by the same variant in future. Experts have repeatedly warned, however, that the virus is seasonal and it is expected to cause problems next winter.\nAllowing the June 21 relaxation could have put millions of people who have yet to have a jab at risk, as well as those who have only had one dose and elderly people who remain vulnerable.\nThe move means that current rules will essentially remain in place until July 19 - with social distancing in force in bars and restaurants, and the edict to work from home where possible staying.\nAt the same time the vaccine rollout will be intensified, with dosing intervals reduced to eight weeks. As a result around two thirds of adults could have been double-jabbed by July 19.\nPublic Health England has warned that a single dose of vaccine, which used to protect well against the virus, no longer cuts it for most people.\nIn a report published last week it said the estimated protection from one dose of either jab has fallen from 50 per cent against the Kent variant to just 33 per cent against Delta.\nThis number measures the reduction in symptomatic illness \u2013 protection remains higher for severe illness or death but is still lower than it was for the Kent strain.\nThe reduction in protection after two doses is much smaller, with it falling from an estimated 88 per cent to 81 per cent.\nThe reason vaccines are less effective than against the Kent variant is because the Indian strain has mutated to look even less like the original Wuhan strain the vaccines are based on.\nVaccines produce antibodies that target the virus like keys to locks and, the more different a virus becomes when it mutates into different variants, the less well the antibodies can stick to and destroy it.\nGovernment experts say hospitalisations should be slashed by between half and a third as a result, preventing 'thousands' of deaths. Modellers have indicated that otherwise hospital admissions could hit 2,000, with 250 or even 500 deaths a day possible.\nIn an effort to sweeten the pill for people who have been putting their lives on hold for more than a year, there will be some easing on the rules for weddings. The 30-person limit on services and receptions will be abandoned - but venues will still be restricted by how many they can accommodate while respecting social distancing rules.\nDancing will also still be out in another blow to couples hoping to celebrate.\nIn a sop to critics, Mr Johnson is offering a 'break clause' with another review of the situation in two weeks' time - although officials warned that it is very unlikely to conclude restrictions can be eased quicker.\nAnd the premier is adamant that there will be no further slippage from the new July 19 timetable. One aide said almost all the 'benefit' from additional jabs will have accrued by that date.\n'The PM is confident we won't need any more than a four week delay,' the aide said.\nBut Mr Johnson's own MPs are livid at the move, with fears running high that this delay is only the first and lockdown might not be dropped at all.\nHe will face a Commons showdown with them on Wednesday, with the new regulations requiring a debate and a vote.\nAlthough they are certain to go through with Labour support, the scale of the rebellion from Tory MPs will show the level of anger he is facing.\nVice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs Sir Charles Walker said that 'existing isn't living' as he raised concerns that restrictions will stay in place all summer.\nSPI-M modellers from Warwick University laid out best, worst and central scenarios of how hospital admissions could pan out in the third wave this summer. In the best case \u2013 which assumes a smaller transmission advantage for the new variant and high vaccine efficacy \u2013 the resurgence is much smaller than the first wave in March 2020 (bottom left). But in the worst case scenario it is almost twice as bad as last year's crisis (bottom right)\nSAGE said that, as the vaccine rollout moves forward and more people get jabs, a greater proportion of people admitted to hospital are likely to be there despite having had a vaccine. It is likely, however, that the overall numbers will be slower and that unvaccinated people will still make up a large proportion of patients\nBoris Johnson tonight confirmed that England's June 21 Freedom Day will be pushed back for a month.\nSAGE advised the Government that the four-week delay would likely be enough to keep cases of the Indian variant at manageable levels and prevent hospitalisations from spiking.\nScientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked at the effects of a circuit breaker in mid-to-late June.\nThey found it would likely push the third peak to October or November, estimating that the Indian variant was 50 per cent more transmissible.\nBut the experts noted that the more stringent short-term measures are, the larger the bounce-back in cases later in autumn.\nThis rebound could be further exacerbated by other factors at that time of year, like schools being open and colder weather pushing people indoors, where Covid spreads more easily.\nReturning to step 2 in the roadmap would be the safest measure, LSHTM researchers found.\nThis would\u00a0involve closing gyms, shops, restaurants and pubs once again.\nIt would result in a third peak about four times smaller than opening as planned on June 21, but this was unacceptable to the Government, who insisted this time would be irreversible.\nResearchers at Imperial College London and Warwick University, which also feed their findings into SAGE, considered the effect of pushing the unlocking back to various dates.\nThe team, which included Imperial's 'Professor Lockdown' Neil Ferguson, concluded that if step four of the roadmap happens on June 21, a third wave would 'very likely' be as big as the second - when there were 4,000 daily hospital admissions - or potentially larger.\nThe longer 'Freedom Day' is pushed back, the more the Indian variant is suppressed, creating a more gradual the increase in cases, they said.\nThis also gives the country more time to vaccinate people.\nWarwick also touted releasing remaining lockdown measures in two stages.\nIt modelled the effects of easing half of curbs in August and October.\nThis would result in a peak about a quarter of the size compared to releasing all restrictions on June 21, but it would again require a very strung-out period of restrictions which ministers are desperate to avoid.\nBoris Johnson\u00a0today announced a four-week delay to the end of the Covid lockdown roadmap as experts fear the now-dominant Indian 'Delta' variant is on the cusp of triggering a third wave.\nCases have spiked 50 per cent in a week across the UK and the number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid is rising slowly in its wake, with more than 1,000 people now on wards with the virus.\nInfections are mostly in the young, with rates up to seven times higher among people in their 20s than in the over-80s, and scientists and ministers are still confident that vaccines will keep a lid on the death toll.\nBut a single dose is no longer enough to protect most people from catching Covid and Mr Johnson must buy the NHS more time to get second jabs out to millions more middle-aged people, who are still at risk of hospitalisation.\nThe PM hinted strongly at the delay when he said on Friday: 'What everybody can see very clearly is that cases are going up and in some places hospitalisations are going up... We will be driven by the data, we will be looking at that and setting it out on Monday.'\nThe trend of total number of people in hospital has remained relatively flat, fluctuating between 800 and 1,100 for the past month but creeping upwards in the most recent week. Experts say the current surge in cases will see it tick up in the coming days and weeks.\nPublic Health England data showed that in the week ending June 6 the highest infection rate was 121 cases per 100,000 people among those aged 20 to 29. Rates were also high in teenagers (99 per 100,000) and adults in their 30s (73). They are significantly lower among older age groups\nCoronavirus cases have undeniably been rising in the UK, and quickly, in recent weeks after the ending of most lockdown rules on May 17 coincided with the takeover of the Indian variant.\nThe average number of positive tests announced each day is now above 7,000 for the first time since the tail end of the second wave in March, after 7,490 cases were confirmed yesterday after 8,125 on Friday.\nThere were 50,017 cases confirmed between Monday and Sunday last week, a 50 per cent spike from 33,496 the week before.\nBut a ray of hope among the rising infections is the fact that cases are up to 17 times higher among young adults than they are in the at-risk elderly, suggesting vaccines are protecting older people.\nPublic Health England data showed that in the week ending June 6 the highest infection rate was 121 cases per 100,000 people among those aged 20 to 29. Rates were also high in teenagers (99 per 100,000) and adults in their 30s (73).\nBut they were significantly lower in the middle-aged and elderly, with the lowest rate in over-70s, at 7 per 100,000, followed by 14 per 100,000 among people in their 60s and 32 per 100,000 in people in their 50s.\nAnd while the rate had doubled in just a week in people in their 20s, it rose by only 17 per cent in the over-80s, showing most of the surging epidemic at the time was in young people.\nHospital admissions are creeping up across the UK and more notably in Delta variant hotspots.\nThe increase has been significantly slower than cases \u2013 there was a 15 per cent increase in the most recent week, from 875 new admissions by June 1 to 1,008 in the week to June 8 \u2013 but this is likely an effect of the lag between someone getting infected and then getting sick enough to need hospital treatment.\nThe real test of how well vaccines will taking pressure off hospitals will come in the next week or two, when there has been enough time \u2013 two to three weeks \u2013 since the spike in cases to see what happens.\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London epidemiologist and member of SAGE, said scientists were hoping the ratio of cases to hospital admissions could be cut by 85 per cent from the pre-jab rate of around nine per cent.\nIn the most recent data, for June 8, there were 187 people admitted to hospital with Covid in the UK, the highest since April 14. By Thursday, June 10, there were a total of 1,089 patients in hospital.\nThe trend of total number of people in hospital has remained relatively flat, fluctuating between 800 and 1,100 for the past month but creeping upwards in the most recent week. Experts say the current surge in cases will see it tick up in the coming days and weeks.\nPlaces where infection rates with the Delta variant are comparatively high \u2013 Bedfordshire, London, Birmingham, Manchester and East Lancashire \u2013 had the highest admission rates in the most recent data but even those, the worst-hit hospitals, still had only five patients admitted on June 6.\nThey also have the most people in hospital in total, with 44 Covid patients on wards in Manchester University NHS Trust on June 8. This was the highest in the country and up almost 60 per cent in a week from 28 on June 1.\nInpatient numbers were rising in all but three of the areas with the most patients \u2013 falling only in Bolton and Croydon, and flat at King's College London, while rising in Imperial College London, East Lancashire, Bedfordshire, Salford Royal in Manchester, Southampton and\u00a0Birmingham.\nThe number of patients with Covid in intensive care remains low in the UK, with only 158 people critically ill in hospital by June 10.\nThis figure rose slightly compared to previous weeks but the trend has been broadly flat \u2013 the lowest point of 2021 was 119 on May 29, just two weeks ago, after it fell from over 4,000 in late January.\nMore detailed information for England, up to June 8, showed that 47 out of a total 140 intensive care patients were all in the North West.\nJust two Indian variant hotspots East Lancashire and Bolton hospitals accounted for 21 of these patients \u2013 15 per cent of the country's total, or one in seven.\nThe delay between cases and the need for intensive care is even longer than it is between people getting infected and getting admitted to a general hospital ward, so these numbers could begin increasing in the coming weeks.\nBut the vaccines are also expected to have an effect on the number of people who become gravely ill. While the jab should stop most people from ending up in hospital at all, even those who do end up in hospital do not seem to be as sick as they used to be.\nChief of the NHS Providers union, Chris Hopson, said last week: 'What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they're seeing what they believe is a significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures.\n'So it's not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it's actually the level of harm and clinical risk.'\nThe Government's four-week delay to the ending of lockdown will be designed to buy time for the vaccine rollout to get second doses to more adults to try and protect them from the Delta variant.\nGovernment data show that more than half of adults have had their second vaccine doses already but millions more still need them. A staggering eight out of 10 have had their first dose\nPublic Health England has warned that a single dose of vaccine, which used to protect well against the virus, no longer cuts it for most people.\nIn a report published last week it said the estimated protection from one dose of either jab has fallen from 50 per cent against the Kent variant to just 33 per cent against Delta.\u00a0The reduction in protection after two doses is much smaller, with it falling from an estimated 88 per cent to 81 per cent.\nMailOnline analysis of official figures last week showed all people aged 50 and above could all have had their second vaccine dose by June 17, at the current rate of immunisation, with protection kicking in a week or two later.\nBut the under-50s may not all have received by their final jab until September 18, fueling concerns a surge in Covid infections caused by the Indian variant may result in a spike in deaths and hospitalisations among the unvaccinated.\nThis assumes the rollout will continue at its current average daily pace of around 265,000 second doses a day, which would be dependent on both supply and uptake rates.\nDr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, agreed that the data suggests delaying lockdown easing by two weeks would make sense.\nHe said:\u00a0'June 17 for all over-50s to have had both doses does seem realistic. And I think they are going to delay June 21 because it takes two weeks for those vaccines to kick in and over-50s are going to be the most important to get done.'\nThe number of people dying each day of coronavirus remains relatively flat \u2013 the daily average reported deaths is nine and the figure has been between eight and 10 for the past three weeks.\nIt briefly fell to a daily average of six for four days in mid-May but has not been lower than that at any time in the pandemic, not even last summer when the virus had been all but stamped out.\nDeaths usually take between two weeks and a month to react after a spike in cases because it can take people so long to die of Covid after they test positive.\nAlthough the success of the vaccines now means that there were will have to be significantly more cases per death compared to earlier waves of the virus, scientists still expect the number of fatalities to rise and fall along with infections \u2013 they just hope there will be fewer.\nProfessor Neil Ferguson said last week: 'It's well within the possibility that we could see another, third, wave at least comparable in terms of hospitalisations as the second wave. At least deaths, I think, certainly would be lower.'\nA lingering worry, however, is the fact that vaccines won't perfectly protect people and that 'vaccine failure' is inevitable in some people \u2013 most likely the old and frail.\nPublic Health England figures show that almost a third of the 42 Britons who have so far died from the Indian (Delta) Covid had been given two vaccine doses.\nThe PHE report showed that of those 42 people who died, 12 were fully vaccinated. From the remaining members of the group, 23 were unvaccinated, while seven had received their first dose more than 21 days before, suggesting they had one-dose protection.\nThe latest data puts the vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease against the Delta variant at 33 per cent after one dose. After two doses, this rises to 81 per cent. This is is lower than the Alpha variant, where the figures are 51 per cent after the first dose, and 88.4 per cent after the second.\nThe Indian 'Delta' variant is now dominant in 263 out of 315 areas of England, up from 201 last week.\nSurveillance data gathered by the Wellcome Sanger Institute revealed that the variant accounted for more than half of infections in 85 per cent of areas across the country in the two weeks leading up to June 5.\nThe strain \u2014 known by scientists as B.1.617.2 \u2014 is more contagious than the Kent 'Alpha' variant and is now dominant in every borough of Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\nThe variant is likely to be even more dominant, due to the delay in determining which variant a positive test was caused by \u2013 Public Health England said last week it was accounting for 96 per cent of positive tests.\nAcross the country, the variant is responsible for 88.4 per cent of all cases, according to the Sanger report. The once-dominant Kent strain now only accounts for 11.3 per cent of cases.\nHavant, in Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight are the only areas that have not recorded any cases of the Delta variant, according to the statistics. All of the cases examined in those two regions were identified as the Kent mutation.\nIn nearly 40 parts of England \u2014 including Cambridge, Newcastle and York \u2014 the strain is thought to be responsible for all Covid infections.\nThe strain is not yet dominant in 28 areas of the country, such as Doncaster, Sheffield and Southampton.\nBut 24 regions did not provided data for the weeks leading up to June 5, so it is unclear how those places \u2014 which include Darlington and Eastbourne \u2014 have been hit by the variant.\nBoring.

                    "value": "1. Energy prices and production\nOil:\u00a0Futures posted their sixth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak since December, as the standoff between OPEC+ ministers over output dragged on. New York prices rose 1.7% last week, closing at $75.16, with London closing at $76.17. Most members of the OPEC alliance backed a proposal to increase supply and extend the deal into later next year, but the United Arab Emirates remains opposed.\nThe US oil futures curve is pointing to a tightness the market hasn\u2019t seen in years, sparking concerns of the potential for sharp inventory drawdowns. The three nearest time spreads on the West Texas Intermediate futures curve hit $1 a barrel or more on Thursday. That\u2019s an indicator that the market is growing increasingly worried about supply tightness, particularly at the key storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.\nCrude oil prices jumped higher after the EIA reported an inventory decline of 6.7 million barrels for the week to June 25th. This follows a draw of 7.6 million barrels for the previous week. US crude exports over the four weeks ended on June 25th rose to a more than one-year-high; the four-week moving average for exports rose 292,000 b/d on the week to 3.546 million b/d.\nThe US Department of Energy will conduct a broad review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by the end of September, the first in five years, to assess its size and responsiveness to current energy markets. Since the SPR was created four decades ago, its structure generally has not changed, even as demands for crude oil and petroleum products have changed significantly.\nThe gradual decline of North Sea output has compelled pricing agencies to include newer grades into the Brent basket to ensure the traded benchmark\u2019s liquidity. The recent maintenance on the Forties pipeline system, with the UK grade being the largest stream within the Brent price-setting barrel pool, has rekindled speculation that pricing transparency requires substantial volumes, which can only come about by physically extending the basket. Norway\u2019s Johan Sverdrup is believed to be the prime candidate to be added to that basket.\nInternational Energy Agency:\u00a0 Hydropower capacity is vital for faster integration of wind and solar power. Still, its growth is set to slow by 23% this decade without a comprehensive policy and investment push, the IEA said. \u201cHydropower is the forgotten giant of clean electricity, and it needs to be put squarely back on the energy and climate agenda if countries are serious about meeting their net-zero goals,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. In addition to producing massive quantities of low-carbon electricity, many hydropower plants can ramp generation up and down very rapidly, allowing for the integration of more intermittent wind and solar power output.\nOPEC:\u00a0The cartel and its allies disagreed on raising oil production on Friday as talks hit a deadlock for a second day. The UAE remained opposed to a deal that does not address concerns over its output target. As oil prices traded close to the highest level in three years, around $76 a barrel, the White House flagged the impact of the ongoing rally on US motorists as the global economy rebounds from the initial hit from the pandemic. The group said it would reconvene by videoconference on Monday.\nSaudi Arabia and Russia had proposed increasing production cautiously by 400,000 barrels each month between August and December, which other countries have broadly supported. They also sought to extend a supply deal among OPEC+ producers beyond next April into the latter half of 2022.\nAccording to a survey, the 13-member organization raised its production to 26.47 million b/d last month, up by 855,000 b/d compared to May. Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s top producer, accounted for more than half of June\u2019s production increase as it hiked its output by 490,000 b/d to 8.95 million.\nShale Oil: The US shale industry is holding back on significant production investments despite bumper profits and surging crude prices, as executives seek to avoid being punished again for responding with rapid investment. Although US crude prices have doubled in the past 12 months, the number of operating oil rigs remains well below recent years. As a result, US oil production languishes almost 15% beneath last year\u2019s record high near 13 million b/d. Industry observers and insiders had expected a rapid recovery from the US shale industry. Now tepid spending and sluggish oilfield activity could leave supplies short as demand recovers. \u201cWe are underinvesting as an industry around the globe,\u201d said Rick Muncrief, chief executive of Devon Energy, one of the largest US shale producers.\nDevon has pledged to hold production flat this year and cap any growth in 2022 at just 5 percent \u2014 less than half the annual pace across the shale patch in the three years of bumper output increases before the pandemic. After years of outspending, Devon is among the shale groups that have pledged to use windfalls from higher prices to strengthen their balance sheets and return capital to investors through dividends or share buybacks.\nLarge oil companies are unloading properties from Texas to California, with some using the market rally as a chance to rake in cash for future investment in the transition to cleaner energy. Other sellers are taking the chance to profit when just a few months ago significant properties were being sold at a loss.\nBanks have started to cut their exposure to US shale, seeing more than 100 producers and oilfield services firms go bust last year and feeling the environmental, social, and governance pressure to reduce credit to fossil fuels. While traditional lenders are cutting their losses and de-risking energy loan portfolios, alternative capital providers are stepping up to scoop up US energy debt at a discount.\nHydraulic fracturing, the technology that made the US the world\u2019s top oil and gas producer, has earned a bad rap. Much of that ill reputation relates to increased seismic activity in shale oil and gas regions. Research cited by the US Geological Survey showed a few years ago that it\u2019s not fracking itself that is the problem. Instead, the problem is the disposal of wastewater, and it is not going away. Earlier this month, Rystad Energy warned in a report that the number of seismic events in critical oil-producing regions has been on the rise.\nNatural Gas: Markets around the globe are rallying as the world\u2019s importers have come to a stark realization: there isn\u2019t enough supply to go around. A long, frigid winter drained gas stockpiles from Louisiana to Germany, and utilities struggled to build them back up. But unforeseen supply disruptions and a rebounding global economy are making it impossible to keep up. That\u2019s setting up a desperate scenario as hot summer temperatures approach, and it\u2019s bound to get even worse when demand peaks this winter.\nTight US supply-demand fundamentals led to the highest prices since December 2018. Last week, the expiring July contract gained 13 cents, hitting a 30-month high at $3.63 per million BTUs. Further out along the curve, the monthly gas contracts gained about 11 to 12 cents up to an average of $3.65 per million. Over the past week, Henry Hub futures and forwards prices have gained about 40 to 45 cents as temperatures across much of the continental US pushed into the 80s F., with even 100s appearing in some locations.\nAsian spot liquefied natural gas prices spiked to a new eight-year seasonal high last week, as demand remained robust globally for power generation needs during the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer. As a result, the average LNG price for August delivery into Northeast Asia was estimated at $14 per metric million British thermal units, up $1.50 from the previous week.\nThe Panama Canal Authority says high arrivals of LNG ships is taking place during the early part of July following a surge in transits during the final week of June. From June 25-29, 11 LNG vessels arrived with reservations and three without.\nOn Tuesday, the US Supreme Court removed a hurdle to the construction of\u00a0a natural gas pipeline\u00a0through Pennsylvania and New Jersey, ruling the pipeline developer could invoke the power of the federal government to take state property needed for the project. The court\u2019s 5-4 opinion handed a significant victory to the natural-gas industry by rejecting New Jersey\u2019s challenge to the actions of the PennEast Pipeline Co., a joint venture of several energy companies that aims to build a 116-mile interstate pipeline.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0estimates\u00a0that the number of abandoned oil and natural gas wells, many of which are leaking methane, exceeds 3 million. A non-profit, the \u201cWell Done Foundation,\u201d is tackling global warming one well at a time by plugging orphaned wells and trapping the methane underground. The effort started in Montana in 2019 but will expand to other states before the fall.\nCoal:\u00a0The US Supreme Court decided that it won\u2019t allow Wyoming and Montana to sue Washington state for denying a pivotal permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia. The two major coal mining states have sought to boost exports to prop up an industry in decline for a decade. The Washington State Department of Ecology in 2017 denied a permit for the export dock, saying the facility on the Columbia River would cause \u201cirreparable and unavoidable\u201d environmental harm.\nElectricity:\u00a0 A clean electricity standard, or CES, and tax credits for renewable energy are \u201cbottom lines\u201d needed in a second infrastructure package that could be passed this year. President Biden has sought to reassure environmental and progressive groups that he will include key climate policy measures in a second infrastructure package that could be passed on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation. The first package, a bipartisan bill in the works between Biden and lawmakers, does not include a CES. This standard would reduce emissions by adopting renewables like wind and solar, nuclear energy, or finding ways to sequester greenhouse gas emissions from fossil-fuel plants.\nPrognosis:\u00a0\u00a0 The oil market will end 2021 in a deficit of 5 million b/d as demand grows by another 2.2 million b/d in the second half of the year, Goldman Sachs analysts say. This means that OPEC+ needs to bring more supply online to help narrow this deficit because other suppliers would find it more challenging to step in and boost production. \u201cWhile a large new infection wave could slow the market rebalancing, we expect OPEC+ to remain tactical in its output hikes with downside risks to global supply elsewhere pointing to a more robust outlook for crude and the upstream sector than petroleum products and the downstream sector.\u201d\nThe spotlight on the insurance industry\u2019s support of fossil fuel projects is proving so searing that the names of some of those involved have been scrubbed from the record. For example, Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain, the operator of a pipeline that takes crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the west coast of British Columbia, made a request of the country\u2019s energy regulator in February. It wished to redact the names of the pipeline\u2019s insurers in its public filings, now and in the future, to shield them against a barrage of publicity from climate campaigners targeting the energy-intensive tar sands industry.\nThe regulator granted the request two months later, despite protestations from groups including the indigenous Tsleil-Waututh Nation. Like the controversial Carmichael coal mine in Australia, the pipeline extension has become a critical battleground for campaigners seeking to stop the financing and underwriting of the most polluting industries.\nIran:\u00a0 Tehran has been restricting UN nuclear inspectors\u2019 access to its main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz, citing security concerns after what it says was an attack on the site by Israel in April. The standoff, which one official said has been going on for weeks, is in the course of being resolved, diplomats said. Still, it has also raised tensions with the West, just as indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the Iran nuclear deal have adjourned without a date set for their resumption.\nA key oilfield near a US military base in Syria\u2019s Deir Ezzor region came under rocket attack on Monday, hours after the US military said it had carried out airstrikes against Iran-backed militia storage facilities in Iraq and Syria. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if US military personnel were near the oilfield when it was attacked.\nOil and petrochemical workers from 60 companies across eight Iranian provinces are now on strike demanding higher wages and better contractual conditions. Iran International reported that the strikes have been intensifying since last week. The London-based Iran news outlet explained that the strikes follow a change in the way people are rehired in the country\u2019s oil industry. Retiring full-time workers are being replaced with employees hired on a temporary contract basis. After 20 years of this practice, there are more than 150,000 temporary workers in the Iranian oil industry who are denied the benefits that full-time, long-term contract workers enjoy.\nIraq:\u00a0 Oil prices have been steadily increasing since the beginning of the year, as the government promises higher export levels. Crude was going for $65.842 a barrel in May, up 23.5% from January. Iraq is expecting $80 a barrel, although no timeframe has been given for this confident prediction. Iraq\u2019s oil exports have been doing well in 2021, as the third-largest oil exporter to China, after Saudi Arabia and Russia, and the top supplier to India. Iraq has been setting its sights on China and India, as oil demand from the two Asian giants looks set to grow well into the next decade.\nIran has drastically cut gas and electricity exports to Iraq, contributing to severe power shortages across the country that prompted the resignation of Iraqi Electricity Minister Hantoush. The gas supply has been reduced to a fraction of contracted volumes, and electricity exports have stopped. The reason was not immediately apparent, but Baghdad owes Tehran billions of dollars for gas and power sales that it has been unable to pay because of US sanctions on money transfers to Iran.\nJust when it looked like Iraq was becoming a regional leader, it decided to halt a $2 billion pre-paid oil supply deal with China\u2019s state-owned Zhenhua Oil despite its aims to strengthen ties with China. Instead, Iraq agreed to end an agreement with Zhenhua and sell its crude supply to other customers as oil prices continue to rise. The Chinese company agreed to a deal earlier this year that would have seen 4 billion b/d of oil supplied each month.\nLibya:\u00a0UN-sponsored talks aimed at paving the way for elections in late December failed to find common ground. However, Raisedon Zenenga, assistant secretary-general and mission coordinator of the UN Support Mission in Libya, called on participants to pursue the effort, describing the talks as \u201cheated debate\u201d marked by walk-out threats. \u201cThe people of Libya will certainly feel let down as they still aspire to the opportunity to exercise their democratic rights in presidential and parliamentary elections on December 24th,\u201d Zenenga told the closing session.\nVenezuela:\u00a0Oil traders discharged record imports of Venezuelan crude in China masked as Malaysian bitumen blends ahead of a June 12th tax that raised import costs by at least 40% for several fuel types. The tax coincided with the restart of a crude upgrade and an oil-blending plant that processed extra-heavy crude from the Orinoco Belt for export. The upgrader is operated by the Petrocedeno joint venture between PDVSA, TotalEnergies and Equinor. The Petrosinovensa blending plant belongs to PDVSA and China National Petroleum Corp.\nPDVSA will use 17 drill rigs, contracted at $1.5 million each, to raise production to an average of 1 million b/d in 2021. Although Orinoco Belt production is key to reaching the nation\u2019s goal in the second half of the year, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned PDVSA will restart the drilling of oil wells while intensifying work to open 3,700 shuttered wells.\nThe central bank is planning to slash six zeroes from the bolivar as early as August after previous attempts to issue larger-denomination bills failed to resolve problems created by endemic inflation. As a result, one dollar would be worth 3.2 bolivars instead of 3,219,000 at present. Venezuela last carried out a \u201credenomination\u201d of the bolivar in 2018 and in March began printing one million bolivar notes, the largest in the country\u2019s history. But that bill is now worth just $0.32 and isn\u2019t enough to buy a cup of coffee.\n3. Climate change\nIt was the most extreme heatwave on record in the Pacific Northwest. As officials count the heat-related deaths over the following weeks, it will almost certainly turn out to be one of the deadliest. Unfortunately, the East Coast was not spared either. Newark recorded its hottest ever June day with a high of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, and in New York, thousands of homes were without power. As climate change drives up global temperatures, deaths linked to extreme heat are increasing, with some scientists projecting that by 2100, the number of heat deaths will match those from all infectious diseases.\nLife-threatening extreme heat linked with global warming has broiled parts of every continent over the last few decades, killing at least 166,000 people from 1998 to 2017. A recent study found that, since the 1950s, periods of extreme heat have become more frequent, longer lasting, and hotter, matching, and even exceeding, climate projections made 20 years ago\nThe European Council set into legislation the objective of a climate-neutral EU by 2050. This follows a political agreement reached with the European Parliament on April 21st. In addition to the goal of climate neutrality and an aspirational goal for the Union to eliminate harmful emissions after 2050, the European climate law sets a binding Union climate target of a reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. Furthermore, to ensure that sufficient efforts to reduce and prevent emissions are deployed until 2030, the climate law introduces a limit of 225 million tons of CO2\u00a0equivalent to achieve that target.\nThe UK is bringing forward its target to end coal use in electricity generation by one year to October 2024 as part of its aim to lead the world in tackling climate change, the government said on Wednesday. \u201cToday we\u2019re sending a clear signal around the world that the UK is leading the way in consigning coal power to the history books and that we\u2019re serious about decarbonizing our power system so we can meet our ambitious, world-leading climate targets.\u201d\n4. The global economy and the coronavirus\nThe fast spread of\u00a0the coronavirus\u2019 Delta variant in much of the world is thwarting plans in many countries to lift lockdowns and reopen economies. Moreover, the variant\u2019s spread has heightened a likely feature of an extended global pandemic: the contrast between poorer unvaccinated countries where hospitalizations and death rates are surging and highly vaccinated populations.\nUnited States:\u00a0Employers\u00a0added 850,000 jobs\u00a0in June\u2014the biggest gain in 10 months\u2014and workers\u2019 wages rose briskly, both signs of robust demand for workers. The unemployment rate, derived from a separate household survey, rose to 5.9% last month from 5.8% in May.\nThe infrastructure bill, a central plank of the Biden plan, faces a complex path to passage in the narrowly divided Congress. In the Senate, Democrats hope to pass the bipartisan bill by drawing enough Republican votes to reach the 60-vote threshold required for most legislation to advance. They also hope\u00a0to pass the broader bill, which expands childcare, Medicare, affordable housing, and other programs, under a unique process tied to the budget, known as reconciliation, that requires only a simple majority.\nAn effort to push the most sweeping changes to the global tax system in a century gained significant momentum on Thursday when 130 nations agreed to a blueprint in which multinational corporations would pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate.\nFord Motor said several of its North American factories would be shut for a few weeks in July and August due to a global shortage of semiconductors. The supply crunch would cost it $2.5 billion this year and halve vehicle production in the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had said in April.\nThe European Union: The number of new coronavirus cases increased across Europe for the first time in 10 weeks, ending a stretch that had raised hopes the pandemic would recede as vaccinations were on the rise. A European Union COVID-19 travel certificate launched last week may help some make trips, but arrivals to tourist hotspots from Portugal to Croatia are set to remain well down from normal levels.\nChina: Expansion in China\u2019s factory sector slowed in June, as export demand weakened while supply bottlenecks held back production. China\u2019s services sector, a persistent laggard in the country\u2019s post-pandemic rebound, softened as recent coronavirus outbreaks again hindered consumer spending. The hints of weakness on both fronts come as economists lowered expectations for China\u2019s growth. Morgan Stanley and Barclays, among others, have downgraded their forecasts for China\u2019s full-year gross domestic product to below 9%, citing the impact of higher raw material prices on production and weaker-than-expected consumption.\nChinese oil companies are likely to slash their July gasoline, gasoil, and jet fuel exports to a six-year low of 1.15 million tons amid tight export quota availability and better domestic margins. Moreover, outflows from China are likely to stay at low levels in the rest of the year, contrasting to a monthly average of 4.31 million tons in the first five months.\nAccording to a new report by an independent think tank, most new coal-power plants being planned will struggle to make back their upfront costs, including all of those under construction in China. It is calculated that 92% of facilities proposed or under construction globally would cost more to build than the future cash flow they would generate. China leads the field with plans to add 187GW of coal-power capacity to the existing supply of more than 1,000GW. India follows with 60GW in the pipeline, compared to the current capacity of 248GW. Indonesia, Vietnam, and Japan make up the remainder of the five Asian countries responsible for 80% of the world\u2019s planned new coal plants. Together they are set to build more than 620 new units with a capacity of more than 300GW.\nRussia:\u00a0The government has introduced harsh new restrictions, including regional lockdowns and compulsory vaccinations, in a belated response to a third coronavirus wave sweeping the country.\u00a0President Putin backed away from his claims about Russia\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d over the pandemic and admitted that the situation had \u201ctaken a turn for the worse\u201d last week as coronavirus cases rocketed.\nDespite the vaccine being free and open to all since December, only 16.7 million of Russia\u2019s 145 million population, or about 13 percent, have had two shots in a country where mistrust of the state and its medical system is high. So, Moscow is requiring most people aged 18 to 60 to be vaccinated and forcing anyone who wants to visit a restaurant starting next week to show a QR code proving they have been vaccinated, been sick with Covid-19 in the past six months or had a negative test result in the past three days.\nAccording to analysts, Russia will keep pace with any easing of OPEC+ production cuts in both the short and medium-term. As the cartel discusses whether to boost output further in August, there has been renewed speculation about whether record production cuts could permanently damage Russian oilfields. While some old and inefficient wells have been shut for good in the past year, the country has largely preserved its pre-pandemic capacity, according to a Bloomberg survey. Russia could boost output by about 700,000 b/d from current levels within six to 12 months. That could return the country to just under the post-Soviet annual production record of 11.25 million b/d reached in 2019.\nSaudi Arabia:\u00a0The government plans to start a second national airline to turn the oil-rich kingdom into a transport hub and help diversify its economy. The strategy includes increasing air connectivity to 250 destinations and doubling air cargo capacity to 4.5 million tons. It will go along with plans to develop ports, rail, and road networks, increasing the transport sector\u2019s contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product to 10% from 6% by 2030. In addition, Saudi Arabia is considering building a new airport in its capital Riyadh to serve as a base for a new airline, which would serve tourists and business travelers. The existing flag carrier, now called \u201cSaudia,\u201d would focus on religious tourism from its base in Jeddah.\nIndia:\u00a0Fuel demand, hit by a deadly second wave of coronavirus, will recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year, Oil Minister Pradhan said. In May, local fuel consumption- a proxy for oil demand \u2013 slumped to its lowest since last August as lockdowns and restrictions in several states stalled mobility and muted economic activity. However, Indian fuel demand showed signs of a resurgence this month due to the lifting of lockdowns by states and a gradual pick-up in economic momentum, Pradhan said at an energy summit. India imports 80%+ of its oil needs.\nAfrica:\u00a0 The variant-driven\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0outbreak that public health officials across Africa had warned about for months is underway \u2014 and it\u2019s happening without the urgently needed ramping up of the continent\u2019s access to vaccines. The variant\u00a0is driving a sharp increase in infections across each of Africa\u2019s central regions, with only a trickle of vaccination donations coming in from wealthy countries.\n\u201cAnyone who cares about this pandemic in the true sense should be frustrated,\u201d John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview. \u201cAs of one week ago, we had vaccinated 1.1 percent of the population of Africa. If you square that with Africa\u2019s population of 1.2 billion, you see we still have a very long way to go to get to 60 percent if vaccines continue this way.\u201d\n5. Renewables and new technologies\nAnnouncements of sizeable new electrolyzer projects and the formation of consortia to build them appear in the news almost daily. The growing number of projects would indicate that capacity to produce green hydrogen will increase sharply in the next few years. Indeed, according to a recent report of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), entitled \u2018Green Hydrogen Supply, A Guide to Policy Making,\u2019 electrolyzer manufacturing capacity worldwide is expected to rise to 3.1GW per year by the end of 2021.\nEnergy professionals say a lack of infrastructure investment, along with cost, is the main barrier to expanding the hydrogen economy. Therefore, repurposing existing infrastructure would be essential to developing a large-scale low-carbon and renewable hydrogen economy.\nNorway\u2019s Equinor and US Steel will examine the potential for developing clean hydrogen production in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, the two companies announced last week. The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to assess the technological and commercial possibilities for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage and looking at potential customers and suppliers. Hydrogen, long used as rocket fuel and in oil refining and to produce ammonia, is an opportunity for the oil and gas sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAt least two dozen US energy firms, including Dominion Energy and Sempra Energy, have started producing hydrogen or testing its viability in natural gas pipes to take advantage of existing infrastructure. Utilities can potentially benefit if they find that clean-burning hydrogen can be successfully transported in existing gas pipes and used in power plants.\nNabors Industries reported last week that it is investing a total of $21 million in a pair of geothermal technology companies. In one instance, the drilling contractor will invest $10 million in Sage Geosystems, which is developing geothermal technologies integrating surface (plant) and subsurface (well) components to improve heat harvesting efficiency at a lower capital cost.\nUsing wind tunnel measurements and computational fluid dynamics simulations, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory engineers have demonstrated that aerodynamically integrated vehicle shapes decrease body-axis drag in a crosswind. This creates considerable negative front pressures that effectively \u201cpull\u201d the vehicle forward against the wind, much like a sailboat. One of the primary sources of inefficiency contributing to the low fuel economy (about six mpg) of heavy vehicles is their relatively large body-axis drag.\nThe new proposed shape, which looks like a bullet train design, would produce body-axis drag values significantly less than those of modern heavy vehicles. Although the reductions in drag come from additional frontal streamlining, manufacturers also would have to pay particular attention to the entire shape.\n6. The Briefs\u00a0(date of the article in the Daily Energy Bulletin is in parentheses)\nA.P. Moller-Maersk\u00a0\u2014 the largest shipping company in the world \u2014 has signed an agreement with South Korea\u2019s Hyundai Mipo Dockyards to build a feeder vessel capable of sailing either on methanol or very low sulfur fuel oil. The project is part of the company\u2019s plans to operate the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral vessel by 2023. (7/1)\nRolls-Royce said it would partner with oil company Shell\u00a0to develop sustainable aviation fuel in line with both their plans for net-zero emissions by 2050. The pair signed a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday. (7/1)\nShell\u2019s H2:\u00a0Royal Dutch Shell on Friday launched Europe\u2019s most giant hydrogen electrolysis plant at the Wesseling site of its Rhein land refinery after two years of construction, as it expands further into alternative energies. The Refhyne plant, with a 10-megawatt capacity, will produce green fuels as part of a European Union-funded consortium that is already setting its sights on a 100 MW facility at the site near Cologne. (7/3)\nNorway\u2019s dubious path:\u00a0Despite announcements last year that it is striving for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, Norway has now said it will go full steam ahead in its oil ventures over the coming decades. While neighboring Denmark plans to end all North Sea operations by 2050, Norway, Western Europe\u2019s largest oil producer, offers exploration and production contracts to several companies. (7/2)\nMoscow\u2019s EV bus push:\u00a0Moscow is halting the purchase of diesel buses for its passenger transport fleet. Starting this year, the city will not buy diesel buses, except for transportation in a particular mode. Otherwise, they will buy only electric buses. (7/2)\nAustralia\u2019s oil industry\u00a0lobby group slammed as \u201cextreme\u201d the amount\u2013A$0.48 per barrel\u2014which the government has proposed as a levy on all of the country\u2019s offshore oil producers to cover the cost of decommissioning an offshore field. (6/29)\nOffshore Western Australia\u00a0Chevron and its partners in the Gorgon LNG project have agreed to go ahead with a $4 billion project to improve gas recovery from offshore wells and keep the substantial liquefied natural gas plant filled for 40 years. The Jansz-Io Compression project, which will help gas recovery at the Gorgon LNG project as the Jansz-Io field ages, is expected to take five years to complete. (7/2)\nNigeria\u2019s Petroleum Industry Bill\u00a0has been two decades in the making to overhaul the way Nigeria will share its oil resources with international oil companies and attract new investment in oil and gas. But community leaders in oil-rich regions want changes to the bill\u2019s latest version, asking for a larger share of revenues for the community. (6/30)\nIn Nigeria,\u00a0the Managing Director of the National Petroleum Corporation yesterday explained why the national oil company was purchasing a stake in the Dangote oil refinery, saying it was for the country\u2019s energy and fiscal security. (6/30)\nThe Niger Delta Avengers\u00a0\u2014 a group of rebels responsible for the bulk of the attacks on Nigeria\u2019s oil infrastructure \u2014 have vowed to commence bombing oil installations across the Niger Delta to protest the government\u2019s neglect of the region. (6/28)\nAngola\u00a0owes foreign oil field operators some $1 billion. This level of debt had forced the country to put up stakes for sale in several offshore oil and gas blocks. (7/2)\nUganda\u2019s first crude project: Lake Albert, Uganda\u2019s first hydrocarbon project ever, will produce some 230kbpd once it reaches peak production. While Western economies are arguing whether oil companies should cease all future exploration activity along with the IEA\u2019s Net-Zero by 2050 scenario, East Africa is shaping up to become one of the hottest exploration frontiers worldwide. (6/30)\nIn Namibia,\u00a0Reconnaissance Energy Africa announced encouraging results in the first section of its second well in the Kavango Basin. (6/28)\nIn Brazil,\u00a0there were fears earlier this year that the virus\u2019s rapid spread would derail Brazil\u2019s offshore oil boom, particularly with a surge in cases among energy sector workers.\u00a0 While production dropped in March, by May it was in a strong recovery. (6/29)\nThe Panama Canal\u00a0faces a creeping threat from climate change, including droughts so intense that ships sometimes reduce their cargo not to run aground and giant storms that almost overwhelm its dams and locks. Unlike Suez, a flat seawater canal where the water depth is defined by the tide, the Panama Canal is a much more complex infrastructure that relies on freshwater and uses a system of locks as aquatic elevators, lifting ships almost 90 feet above sea level onto a navigable waterway, and then lowering them down at the other end. (6/29)\nIn the shadow of Canada\u2019s mega oil sands projects, smaller, technologically outdated facilities produce up to three times more emissions per barrel than the already high sector average but rising oil prices have given them a new lease of life. With oil prices near 2-1/2-year highs and dim prospects for building new projects in a world heading toward net-zero emissions, operators aim to pump as much as they can from existing facilities \u2013 including from the most carbon-intense sites. Producers are cashing in as they seek to repair their balance sheets from the damage inflicted by the coronavirus. (6/29)\nThe Government of Canada\u00a0is setting a mandatory target for all new light-duty cars and passenger trucks sales to be zero-emission by 2035, accelerating Canada\u2019s previous goal of 100% sales by 2040. The Government of Canada will pursue a combination of investments and regulations to help Canadians and industry transition to achieve the new goal. (7/1)\nThe US oil rig count\u00a0grew by 4 to 376 while the gas rig count inched up by 1 to 99, according to Baker Hughes\u2019s weekly report.\u00a0 The total rig count of 475 represents an increase of 212 rigs this year and is 205 more than last year. (7/3)\nShell sells CA asset:\u00a0Royal Dutch Shell plans to leave Aera, its California-based oil and gas-producing joint venture with Exxon Mobil Corp. Aera produces about 125,000 barrels of oil and 32 million cubic feet of natural gas each day, accounting for about 25% of the state\u2019s oil and gas production. (7/1)\nIn Texas,\u00a0Sempra\u2019s efforts to finalize a long-term deal with Saudi Aramco to support the proposed Port Arthur LNG export terminal in Texas have fallen through. (6/30)\nUnited Airlines\u00a0announced Tuesday that it ordered 270 single-aisle planes from Boeing and Airbus, the biggest aircraft purchase in United\u2019s history and the largest in the United States in a decade. The deal will drive an expansion of United\u2019s fleet, in both the number and the size of its planes. (6/29)\nTeaming up: The US Administration\u00a0supports a city in Maine that has prohibited storage and handling of crude oil that would be shipped via a pipeline from Canada in a court brief that environmentalists hope would be similar to how the federal government could react to the Enbridge-Michigan saga. (7/1)\nBiofuel\u2019s waivers:\u00a0US lawmakers introduced a bill on Friday to limit exemptions offered to refiners on blending biofuels after sources said the Environmental Protection Agency chief voiced disapproval about a Supreme Court ruling upholding broad use of the waiver program. (7/3)\nBiofuels E-15:\u00a0A US appeals court July 2nd vacated the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s approval of year-round E15 fuel sales, rejecting the regulatory process it took to fulfill former President Donald Trump\u2019s October 2018 promise to farm-state senators to blend more ethanol into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply. (7/3)\nNew Hudson tunnel?\u00a0Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg got a close-up look at the crumbling state of New York City\u2019s most critical rail link on Monday and vowed that the Biden administration was committed to getting a new train tunnel built under the Hudson River.\u00a0 The project cost is estimated at $11.6 billion. (6/29)\nThe US Supreme Court\u00a0decided Monday that it won\u2019t allow Wyoming and Montana to sue Washington state for denying a pivotal permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia. The two major coal mining states have sought to boost exports to prop up an industry in decline for a decade as US utilities switch to gas-fired power and renewable energy. (6/30)\nOffshore US wind:\u00a0The US must speed up project permits to meet the Biden administration\u2019s 2030 target for offshore wind power, primary developer Orsted said on Thursday. The administration of President Joe Biden has set a goal to install 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power capacity in US waters by 2030 \u2013 nearly the amount that already exists in Europe\u2019s two-decade-old industry. Yet, it can take as much as ten years to plan and build new projects. (7/2)\nSouth Korea\u2019s big wind:\u00a0With a climate and topography ill-suited for large-scale wind power generation on the land, the country looks out to sea for its clean energy ambitions.\u00a0 Presently South Korea produces electricity from 20 wind turbines in the Southwest Sea. Soon the area is going to be turned into the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm. (7/1)\nGermany\u00a0has gathered support from four European Union countries around its opposition to classifying nuclear energy as \u201cgreen\u201d and sustainable for investment purposes. Spain, Austria, Denmark, and Luxembourg joined Germany in saying investors concerned about nuclear waste storage could lose confidence in financial products labeled green if they included nuclear energy without their knowledge. (7/3)\nZimbabwe\u00a0faced prolonged power outages after a surge in electricity imports from neighboring South Africa overloaded its network and caused generating plants to fail. The surge caused a nationwide blackout early Monday. (6/29)\nBrazil\u2019s worst water crisis\u00a0in nearly a century is fueling inflation that\u2019s reverberating through the economy, posing an additional challenge for the central bank and President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s re-election bid. Electricity bills will increase as much as 15% next month as dangerously low water levels in hydroelectric reservoirs force the government to turn to more expensive power plants fueled by natural gas, diesel, or coal. Food prices are also going up as farmers lose part of their crops to the drought. (6/28)\nVaccination certs:\u00a0The European Union started rolling out a first-of-a-kind digital health certificate that permits people who have been vaccinated to travel freely within the bloc without the need to quarantine or test negative for Covid-19 upon arrival at their destination. (7/2)\nKim Jong Un\u00a0said North Korea\u2019s Covid-19 situation\u00a0has become grave and admonished senior officials for lapses in the fight against the disease. Mr. Kim, speaking at a Politburo meeting, didn\u2019t specify what had gone wrong. (6/30)\nPlastics: Covid-19 led to a sharp rise in the production of single-use plastics, a significant proportion of which end up in the world\u2019s oceans. With the pandemic gradually being brought under control, emerging markets are now stepping up efforts to tackle marine pollution.

                    "value": "Hospital admissions for Covid could surge past 7,000 a day in England's third wave if the Indian 'Delta' variant is 120 per cent more transmissible than the Kent strain and lockdown had ended on June 21, No10's top scientific advisers\u00a0warned the Government.\nResearchers at Warwick University, who sit on the SPI-M group that advises SAGE, cautioned that the size of the next surge will be dictated in part by how much faster the now-dominant new version of the virus can spread.\nScientists are sure it is more infectious but still don't know what the true figure is. They believe it to be around 60 per cent higher than Kent 'Alpha' variant, which triggered the second wave, but admit the increase could be much bigger or smaller.\nIf it were as high as 119 per cent, the Warwick team warned, the third wave could peak with 7,200 daily hospital admissions for the virus \u2013 previous highs were\u00a03,565 in the first wave and\u00a04,577 in a day the second.\nIn that scenario another 243,000 people could be admitted to hospital between now and June 2022 \u2013 around half again on the total so far \u2013 and 51,900 more people could die, taking the death toll above 200,000.\nThis was presented as the team's worst case scenario, however, and their most likely estimate of 56 per cent extra transmissibility put the figures at a daily peak of 2,850 admissions, a total of 131,000 and 17,100 more deaths in a year \u2013 all based on social distancing having finished next week as planned.\nSPI-M suggests the likely transmissibility advantage is between 40 and 80 per cent over the Kent variant. An 80 per cent rise could result in a peak of 4,000 to 5,000 admissions per day, while 40 per cent could cause 1,900, the Warwick team estimated.\nDespite the dire figures, hospitals are currently bearing up well with the help of widespread vaccination despite a rise in Covid cases with the number of new infections creeping up by more than half\u00a0in the last week.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, today revealed that just one in 100 hospital beds across the country has a Covid patient in it and that almost two thirds of patients are under 65, who are more likely to survive. At the height of the pandemic, 60 per cent of the infected were over 65.\nIf the variant's transmissibility advantage were as high as 119 per cent, the Warwick team warned, the third wave could peak with 7,200 daily hospital admissions for the virus (orange line) \u2013 previous highs were 3,565 in the first wave and 4,577 in a day the second.\u00a0This was presented as the team's worst case scenario, however, and their most likely estimate of 56 per cent extra transmissibility put the figures at a daily peak of 2,850 admissions (red line)\nOne of the Warwick University researchers, epidemiologist Professor Matt Keeling said today: 'We know that the Alpha had had a considerable impact and a considerable advantage compared to the wild type that was around last year \u2013 probably around 50 per cent \u2013 and then we're estimating that the Delta variant is having an additional impact on top of that.\n'If you compare Alpha and Delta you see that we're talking about probably about a 60 per cent \u2013 estimated from our model \u2013 transmission advantage...\n'That\u2019s combined with the fact that we know there's slightly less protection from the vaccine, so there's a mixture of things here that have combined to give the Delta variant its advantage...\n'There's very, very good evidence that this is spreading much faster than we\u2019d have anticipated if we'd have just had the Alpha variant.\u00a0Not surprisingly the bigger the transmission advantage, the bigger the third wave is likely to be.'\nThe Warwick modelling, which was one of three sets of research that informed the Government's decision to postpone the end of lockdown last night, laid out factors that could affect how bad the third wave will be.\nThe only one that could be properly controlled by ministers was the timing of taking Step Four on the lockdown roadmap and ending all social distancing laws.\nSlated for June 21 when the plan was made, before the Indian variant emerged, that date has now been pushed back to a provisional July 19 to buy scientists more time to understand how bad the strain really is and to dish out jabs to millions more adults.\nSpeeding up the vaccine rollout or splitting Step Four into two stages and spreading it across July and August, could reduce the number of hospital admissions and deaths but not by as much as delaying Step Four altogether, they said.\nExperts will hold out hope that the vaccines work better than expected against the new variant and that it does not spread as quickly as the worst-case scenarios suggested it could \u2013 both will help to keep a lid on the death toll and pressure on the NHS.\nProfessor Keeling added: 'What's noticeable is that putting in a four-week delay really does reduce the peak height that we\u2019re projecting for wave three.\n'But notice that deaths because\u00a0of the fantastic action that we're seeing in vaccination we think that deaths are probably going to be a lot lower, certainly in our model, than we\u2019ve seen so far because we think we're getting better protection from the vaccine against death compared to hospitalisation.'\nHe said there are still 'huge uncertainties' but added: 'This four-week delay is going to buy us time to understand and quantify many of these uncertainties which means we will be able to do better projections working forward.\n'But also the fact that we\u2019ve got this four-week delay allows us additional time for vaccination and therefore far greater protection of the population.\n'Looking at our models, we estimate that this extra four weeks is going to reduce the total number of hospital admissions by about 20-25 per cent and reduces the peak number of hospital admissions by 45-50 per cent, which really is going to limit the burden on the NHS.'\nSAGE files published last night as Boris Johnson spoke at Downing Street showed that the team at Warwick and others at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine had told ministers delaying the end of\u00a0lockdown\u00a0by four weeks could halve the number of people who get admitted to hospital.\nReports from the scientific advisers' meeting last week shows that if 'Freedom Day' had gone ahead as planned there could have been a summer peak of more than 200,000 infections per day along with more than 2,000 daily admissions to hospital and over 500 deaths per day.\nSir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said today that just one in 100 hospital beds across the country has a Covid patient in it and that almost three quarters of patients are under 65, who are more likely to survive.\nSpeaking at the NHS Confederation annual conference the outgoing chief said: 'At the moment about one per cent of hospital beds in England are occupied by patients with a Covid diagnosis and the age distribution has really flipped as a result of vaccination.\n'Back in January, it was 60/40 \u2013 60 per cent of beds occupied by people over 65; 40 per cent under 65.\n'Now it\u2019s flipped to 30/70, so it\u2019s about 30 per cent occupied by people aged 65 and over; 70 per cent by younger people whose prospects are much greater.'\nThe ghastly predictions warn of a wave to rival the first crisis in March 2020 and close to the second wave, although top researchers are still in the dark about how well vaccines would control this.\nThe Indian 'Delta' variant has turned the lockdown roadmap on its head after measures appeared to be working against the 'Alpha' Kent variant but not strong enough to control the new strain.\nSAGE warned there would be a 'large resurgence in infections and admissions' in any scenario in which lockdown rules were lifted on June 21. It added: 'The scale of this resurgence is highly uncertain, and it could be either considerably smaller or larger than previous waves.'\nEarly data suggest that single vaccine doses are only 33 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid, meaning almost half of adults have inadequate protection, and Boris Johnson has delayed the final step of his roadmap in order to buy time for second vaccines to be given to millions more.\nSAGE clearly lobbied for a delay and said the longer restrictions can stay in place, the more hospital admissions and deaths could be reduced, but added: 'Most of the benefit comes from the first four weeks of delay.'\nThe\u00a0 group, headed up by Professor Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, said: 'This is partly because four weeks is long enough to ensure significantly more vaccination coverage and would push Step 4 close to the school holidays, when transmission is expected to be reduced.'\nBoris Johnson's spokesperson said today that a delay of just a mount would prevent 'thousands of deaths' and added: 'You have a significant proportion of cohorts one to nine who have yet to have second doses, and we have seen a potentially a higher level of hospitalisations. We are seeing below 50s going into hospital.'\nAnalysis by Warwick University modellers showed how daily Covid hospital admissions could hit up to 2,500 a day, if June 21 went ahead. Scientific estimates also showed how the curve of admissions would peak at just over 1,000 a day if Freedom Day was pushed back to July 19. The team also looked at what would happen if the final unlocking took place on August 23\nScientists estimated that a longer delay would flatten the curve and lead to a smaller hike in the number of patients taking up hospital beds with Covid, with the smallest peak if social distancing carried on until December and the highest one if June 21 went ahead. But in the meeting last week they admitted: 'Most of the benefit comes from the first four weeks of delay'\nINFECTIONS: SPI-M warned that the number of people catching the virus each day could spike to more than 250,000 per day over the summer wit the new fast-spreading variant and no lockdown rules. The second wave appeared to peak at a total of 1.1million people being infected at any one time \u2013 daily cases are not accurately measured except through testing, which peaked at around 70,000 a day\nBy July 19, which is the next date earmarked for the lifting of England\u2019s remaining restrictions, officials hope around two thirds of all adults will have been offered both doses of vaccine, ahead of the original schedule for the end of the month.\nAnalysis by Public Health England suggests the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 96% effective against hospitalisation after two doses, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is 92% effective after a second jab. Efficacy rates are expected to be high even for the Delta variant but they will be less able to prevent infection.\nScientists and officials do not yet believe it is possible to contain the virus without some social distancing, until more people have been vaccinated. Modelling suggests that had the easing of lockdown not been delayed, hospital admissions could have reached the heights of the first peak in March 2020.\nThis is the main reason why the Prime Minister felt he could not proceed with the June 21 reopening. The Delta variant, first identified in India, is believed to be between 40 and 80 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha strain and twice as likely to lead to hospital admission.\nThere are now around 8,000 new cases a day, the highest since February. In around one third of England, cases are doubling every week.\nUnvaccinated people have twice the risk of hospital admission with the Delta variant as the Alpha variant, while among those who are vaccinated 12 people in every 100 may end up in hospital with Delta compared with eight for Alpha.\nSAGE modelling sub-group SPI-M, the\u00a0Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, said that there was no scenario in which they could be confident it was safe to open up the country to normal life next Monday.\nMembers said they still weren't sure how much faster the Delta variant spreads \u2013 although it is thought to be between 40 and 80 per cent, likely 60 \u2013 nor how well vaccines protect against severe disease, or how people would change their behaviour after the roadmap had ended.\nScientists have thought it is unlikely people would immediately return to life as if Covid didn't exist, but if they did it could have disastrous consequences.\nSPI-M said in a report: 'In all scenarios modelled, even a short delay to the timing to Step 4 results in a significant drop in the number of people being admitted to hospital as more people are vaccinated and as the school summer holidays get closer.\n'Even a two-week delay would have a significant effect, but a four-week delay is modelled as reducing the peak in hospital admissions by around a third to a half.\n'A delay would also allow evidence to build up on the effectiveness of vaccines against delta, potentially increasing precision in future modelling scenarios.'\nThe team said that, although hospitals are not under a lot of pressure from Covid right now, this is expected to 'rapidly increase' in the short term.\nAnother 187 people were admitted to hospital with Covid last Tuesday, June 8, the highest figure since April and a spike of a fifth on the previous Tuesday.\nThere are expected to have been even more in the six days since then following in the trail of a huge surge in infections.\nThe amount of hospital admissions that could happen in the next wave of the virus will depend partly on how much faster the variant transmits than the current strain.\nIn the SPI-M modelling the researchers suggested that if the strain were 80 per cent more transmissible \u2013 the upper limit of the team's estimate \u2013 admissions could peak at more than 6,000 per day, higher even than the second wave.\nThe virus is assumed in the models to be around 56 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha Kent variant.\nThe main models presented to SAGE did not estimate the size of future waves of the virus in the autumn or winter because they are uncertain about how the next resurgence will play out.\nThe fact that the next spike is not expected to end in a lockdown means there is a chance the virus will burn out naturally, which could reduce the risk of another huge surge caused by the same variant in future. Experts have repeatedly warned, however, that the virus is seasonal and it is expected to cause problems next winter.\nAllowing the June 21 relaxation could have put millions of people who have yet to have a jab at risk, as well as those who have only had one dose and elderly people who remain vulnerable.\nThe move means that current rules will essentially remain in place until July 19 - with social distancing in force in bars and restaurants, and the edict to work from home where possible staying.\nPublic Health England has warned that a single dose of vaccine, which used to protect well against the virus, no longer cuts it for most people.\nIn a report published last week it said the estimated protection from one dose of either jab has fallen from 50 per cent against the Kent variant to just 33 per cent against Delta.\nThis number measures the reduction in symptomatic illness \u2013 protection remains higher for severe illness or death but is still lower than it was for the Kent strain.\nThe reduction in protection after two doses is much smaller, with it falling from an estimated 88 per cent to 81 per cent.\nThe reason vaccines are less effective than against the Kent variant is because the Indian strain has mutated to look even less like the original Wuhan strain the vaccines are based on.\nVaccines produce antibodies that target the virus like keys to locks and, the more different a virus becomes when it mutates into different variants, the less well the antibodies can stick to and destroy it.\nAt the same time the vaccine rollout will be intensified, with dosing intervals reduced to eight weeks. As a result around two thirds of adults could have been double-jabbed by July 19.\nGovernment experts say hospitalisations should be slashed by between half and a third as a result, preventing 'thousands' of deaths. Modellers have indicated that otherwise hospital admissions could hit 2,000, with 250 or even 500 deaths a day possible.\nIn an effort to sweeten the pill for people who have been putting their lives on hold for more than a year, there will be some easing on the rules for weddings. The 30-person limit on services and receptions will be abandoned - but venues will still be restricted by how many they can accommodate while respecting social distancing rules.\nDancing will also still be out in another blow to couples hoping to celebrate.\nIn a sop to critics, Mr Johnson is offering a 'break clause' with another review of the situation in two weeks' time - although officials warned that it is very unlikely to conclude restrictions can be eased quicker.\nAnd the premier is adamant that there will be no further slippage from the new July 19 timetable. One aide said almost all the 'benefit' from additional jabs will have accrued by that date.\n'The PM is confident we won't need any more than a four week delay,' the aide said.\nBut Mr Johnson's own MPs are livid at the move, with fears running high that this delay is only the first and lockdown might not be dropped at all.\nHe will face a Commons showdown with them on Wednesday, with the new regulations requiring a debate and a vote.\nAlthough they are certain to go through with Labour support, the scale of the rebellion from Tory MPs will show the level of anger he is facing.\nVice chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench MPs Sir Charles Walker said that 'existing isn't living' as he raised concerns that restrictions will stay in place all summer.\nSPI-M modellers from Warwick University laid out best, worst and central scenarios of how hospital admissions could pan out in the third wave this summer. In the best case \u2013 which assumes a smaller transmission advantage for the new variant and high vaccine efficacy \u2013 the resurgence is much smaller than the first wave in March 2020 (bottom left). But in the worst case scenario it is almost twice as bad as last year's crisis (bottom right)\nSAGE said that, as the vaccine rollout moves forward and more people get jabs, a greater proportion of people admitted to hospital are likely to be there despite having had a vaccine. It is likely, however, that the overall numbers will be slower and that unvaccinated people will still make up a large proportion of patients\nBoris Johnson\u00a0today announced a four-week delay to the end of the Covid lockdown roadmap as experts fear the now-dominant Indian 'Delta' variant is on the cusp of triggering a third wave.\nCases have spiked 50 per cent in a week across the UK and the number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid is rising slowly in its wake, with more than 1,000 people now on wards with the virus.\nInfections are mostly in the young, with rates up to seven times higher among people in their 20s than in the over-80s, and scientists and ministers are still confident that vaccines will keep a lid on the death toll.\nBut a single dose is no longer enough to protect most people from catching Covid and Mr Johnson must buy the NHS more time to get second jabs out to millions more middle-aged people, who are still at risk of hospitalisation.\nThe PM hinted strongly at the delay when he said on Friday: 'What everybody can see very clearly is that cases are going up and in some places hospitalisations are going up... We will be driven by the data, we will be looking at that and setting it out on Monday.'\nThe trend of total number of people in hospital has remained relatively flat, fluctuating between 800 and 1,100 for the past month but creeping upwards in the most recent week. Experts say the current surge in cases will see it tick up in the coming days and weeks.\nPublic Health England data showed that in the week ending June 6 the highest infection rate was 121 cases per 100,000 people among those aged 20 to 29. Rates were also high in teenagers (99 per 100,000) and adults in their 30s (73). They are significantly lower among older age groups\nCoronavirus cases have undeniably been rising in the UK, and quickly, in recent weeks after the ending of most lockdown rules on May 17 coincided with the takeover of the Indian variant.\nThe average number of positive tests announced each day is now above 7,000 for the first time since the tail end of the second wave in March, after 7,490 cases were confirmed yesterday after 8,125 on Friday.\nThere were 50,017 cases confirmed between Monday and Sunday last week, a 50 per cent spike from 33,496 the week before.\nBut a ray of hope among the rising infections is the fact that cases are up to 17 times higher among young adults than they are in the at-risk elderly, suggesting vaccines are protecting older people.\nPublic Health England data showed that in the week ending June 6 the highest infection rate was 121 cases per 100,000 people among those aged 20 to 29. Rates were also high in teenagers (99 per 100,000) and adults in their 30s (73).\nBut they were significantly lower in the middle-aged and elderly, with the lowest rate in over-70s, at 7 per 100,000, followed by 14 per 100,000 among people in their 60s and 32 per 100,000 in people in their 50s.\nAnd while the rate had doubled in just a week in people in their 20s, it rose by only 17 per cent in the over-80s, showing most of the surging epidemic at the time was in young people.\nHospital admissions are creeping up across the UK and more notably in Delta variant hotspots.\nThe increase has been significantly slower than cases \u2013 there was a 15 per cent increase in the most recent week, from 875 new admissions by June 1 to 1,008 in the week to June 8 \u2013 but this is likely an effect of the lag between someone getting infected and then getting sick enough to need hospital treatment.\nThe real test of how well vaccines will taking pressure off hospitals will come in the next week or two, when there has been enough time \u2013 two to three weeks \u2013 since the spike in cases to see what happens.\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London epidemiologist and member of SAGE, said scientists were hoping the ratio of cases to hospital admissions could be cut by 85 per cent from the pre-jab rate of around nine per cent.\nIn the most recent data, for June 8, there were 187 people admitted to hospital with Covid in the UK, the highest since April 14. By Thursday, June 10, there were a total of 1,089 patients in hospital.\nThe trend of total number of people in hospital has remained relatively flat, fluctuating between 800 and 1,100 for the past month but creeping upwards in the most recent week. Experts say the current surge in cases will see it tick up in the coming days and weeks.\nPlaces where infection rates with the Delta variant are comparatively high \u2013 Bedfordshire, London, Birmingham, Manchester and East Lancashire \u2013 had the highest admission rates in the most recent data but even those, the worst-hit hospitals, still had only five patients admitted on June 6.\nThey also have the most people in hospital in total, with 44 Covid patients on wards in Manchester University NHS Trust on June 8. This was the highest in the country and up almost 60 per cent in a week from 28 on June 1.\nInpatient numbers were rising in all but three of the areas with the most patients \u2013 falling only in Bolton and Croydon, and flat at King's College London, while rising in Imperial College London, East Lancashire, Bedfordshire, Salford Royal in Manchester, Southampton and\u00a0Birmingham.\nThe number of patients with Covid in intensive care remains low in the UK, with only 158 people critically ill in hospital by June 10.\nThis figure rose slightly compared to previous weeks but the trend has been broadly flat \u2013 the lowest point of 2021 was 119 on May 29, just two weeks ago, after it fell from over 4,000 in late January.\nMore detailed information for England, up to June 8, showed that 47 out of a total 140 intensive care patients were all in the North West.\nJust two Indian variant hotspots East Lancashire and Bolton hospitals accounted for 21 of these patients \u2013 15 per cent of the country's total, or one in seven.\nThe delay between cases and the need for intensive care is even longer than it is between people getting infected and getting admitted to a general hospital ward, so these numbers could begin increasing in the coming weeks.\nBut the vaccines are also expected to have an effect on the number of people who become gravely ill. While the jab should stop most people from ending up in hospital at all, even those who do end up in hospital do not seem to be as sick as they used to be.\nChief of the NHS Providers union, Chris Hopson, said last week: 'What chief executives are consistently telling us is that it is a much younger population that is coming in, they are less clinically vulnerable, they are less in need of critical care and therefore they're seeing what they believe is a significantly lower mortality rate which is, you know, borne out by the figures.\n'So it's not just the numbers of people who are coming in, it's actually the level of harm and clinical risk.'\nThe Government's four-week delay to the ending of lockdown will be designed to buy time for the vaccine rollout to get second doses to more adults to try and protect them from the Delta variant.\nGovernment data show that more than half of adults have had their second vaccine doses already but millions more still need them. A staggering eight out of 10 have had their first dose\nPublic Health England has warned that a single dose of vaccine, which used to protect well against the virus, no longer cuts it for most people.\nIn a report published last week it said the estimated protection from one dose of either jab has fallen from 50 per cent against the Kent variant to just 33 per cent against Delta.\u00a0The reduction in protection after two doses is much smaller, with it falling from an estimated 88 per cent to 81 per cent.\nMailOnline analysis of official figures last week showed all people aged 50 and above could all have had their second vaccine dose by June 17, at the current rate of immunisation, with protection kicking in a week or two later.\nBut the under-50s may not all have received by their final jab until September 18, fueling concerns a surge in Covid infections caused by the Indian variant may result in a spike in deaths and hospitalisations among the unvaccinated.\nThis assumes the rollout will continue at its current average daily pace of around 265,000 second doses a day, which would be dependent on both supply and uptake rates.\nDr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, agreed that the data suggests delaying lockdown easing by two weeks would make sense.\nHe said:\u00a0'June 17 for all over-50s to have had both doses does seem realistic. And I think they are going to delay June 21 because it takes two weeks for those vaccines to kick in and over-50s are going to be the most important to get done.'\nThe number of people dying each day of coronavirus remains relatively flat \u2013 the daily average reported deaths is nine and the figure has been between eight and 10 for the past three weeks.\nIt briefly fell to a daily average of six for four days in mid-May but has not been lower than that at any time in the pandemic, not even last summer when the virus had been all but stamped out.\nDeaths usually take between two weeks and a month to react after a spike in cases because it can take people so long to die of Covid after they test positive.\nAlthough the success of the vaccines now means that there were will have to be significantly more cases per death compared to earlier waves of the virus, scientists still expect the number of fatalities to rise and fall along with infections \u2013 they just hope there will be fewer.\nProfessor Neil Ferguson said last week: 'It's well within the possibility that we could see another, third, wave at least comparable in terms of hospitalisations as the second wave. At least deaths, I think, certainly would be lower.'\nA lingering worry, however, is the fact that vaccines won't perfectly protect people and that 'vaccine failure' is inevitable in some people \u2013 most likely the old and frail.\nPublic Health England figures show that almost a third of the 42 Britons who have so far died from the Indian (Delta) Covid had been given two vaccine doses.\nThe PHE report showed that of those 42 people who died, 12 were fully vaccinated. From the remaining members of the group, 23 were unvaccinated, while seven had received their first dose more than 21 days before, suggesting they had one-dose protection.\nThe latest data puts the vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease against the Delta variant at 33 per cent after one dose. After two doses, this rises to 81 per cent. This is is lower than the Alpha variant, where the figures are 51 per cent after the first dose, and 88.4 per cent after the second.\nThe Indian 'Delta' variant is now dominant in 263 out of 315 areas of England, up from 201 last week.\nSurveillance data gathered by the Wellcome Sanger Institute revealed that the variant accounted for more than half of infections in 85 per cent of areas across the country in the two weeks leading up to June 5.\nThe strain \u2014 known by scientists as B.1.617.2 \u2014 is more contagious than the Kent 'Alpha' variant and is now dominant in every borough of Greater Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London.\nThe variant is likely to be even more dominant, due to the delay in determining which variant a positive test was caused by \u2013 Public Health England said last week it was accounting for 96 per cent of positive tests.\nAcross the country, the variant is responsible for 88.4 per cent of all cases, according to the Sanger report. The once-dominant Kent strain now only accounts for 11.3 per cent of cases.\nHavant, in Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight are the only areas that have not recorded any cases of the Delta variant, according to the statistics. All of the cases examined in those two regions were identified as the Kent mutation.\nIn nearly 40 parts of England \u2014 including Cambridge, Newcastle and York \u2014 the strain is thought to be responsible for all Covid infections.\nThe strain is not yet dominant in 28 areas of the country, such as Doncaster, Sheffield and Southampton.\nBut 24 regions did not provided data for the weeks leading up to June 5, so it is unclear how those places \u2014 which include Darlington and Eastbourne \u2014 have been hit by the variant.\nHere they go again SAGE scaremongering, just FO yo...\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article."

                    "value": "In early June, Microsoft patched a Windows vulnerability that it initially classified as low risk. But security researchers say that patch didn't actually fix a closely related, much worse vulnerability. Researchers have since published proof-of-concept code that shows exactly how to exploit the bug, a sign that the bug is likely to be exploited if users don't ultimately update their systems once the vulnerability is fixed.\nThe bug is called PrintNightmare, as it exploits a flaw in a legacy Windows' printing service that is reported to be used by default by several versions of Windows and Windows Server.\nSeveral researchers have confirmed that the bug can be exploited right now, and that the patch issued by Microsoft earlier this month does not fix it. In fact, according to multiple researchers, PrintNightmare is not the same flaw as CVE-2021-1675, which is the one patched in early June.\nEssentially, this has turned into a giant mess.\nOn Sunday, Chinese cybersecurity company QiAnXin Technology tweeted a video claiming to have found a way to exploit the bug that Microsoft supposedly patched. The firm did not publish any technical details. But on Tuesday, Zhiniang Peng and Xuefeng Li, two researchers from the company Sangfor, published code that could be used to exploit the bug on GitHub, and while the researchers then deleted it, others copied it before they did.\nOn June 21, Microsoft reclassified the vulnerability as high risk, as it allows Remote Code Execution, or RCE, the industry's jargon for a flaw that allows hackers to take full control of a target's computer or server. To be clear, bugs that enable RCE can be very bad.\n\"I think Microsoft realized the flaw is critical, it's just that the issued patch didn't completely address the underlying vulnerability,\" Joe Slowik, a security researcher and intelligence and detection lead at cybersecurity firm Gigamon. \"This is concerning.\"\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThere appears to be a way for people who are worried about this to mitigate the risks.\n\"The only mitigation we know currently is disabling the Print Spooler service, which of course has an unpleasant side effect of not being able to print via the server anymore,\" Mitja Kolsek, the CEO of ACROS Security and one of the researchers who has looked into this exploit, told Motherboard in an online chat.\nDo you have more information about this vulnerability?

Rewind to June 8's Patch Tuesday, and Microsoft issued a fix for CVE-2021-1675, which was labeled a privilege-escalation vulnerability. This security hole could be exploited by a normal user to execute code as an administrator on a system running the print spooler service. Then on June 21, with no explanation, that classification was upped by Microsoft to a more serious remote-code execution vuln.\nA group of security researchers, upon seeing that the bug had been upgraded in severity, decided they may as well release their proof-of-concept exploit for a remote-code execution hole in the print spooler service, presumably thinking it was now patched. But it wasn't patched. The exploit code they released targets a bug that's similar to but not quite CVE-2021-1675, and now it's out in the wild for miscreants to use to commandeer networks. That unpatched bug has been dubbed PrintNightmare, and will likely need a separate update from Microsoft to fully address it.\nPrintNightmare can be exploited by a malicious or compromised authenticated user to execute code at the SYSTEM level on a remote domain controller via the vulnerable Windows Print Spooler service running on that box. That's bad news. Like CVE-2021-1675, PrintNightmare may affect more than just domain controllers. Any Windows installation running the vulnerable print spooler service may potentially be at risk; domain controllers are a more valuable target, however.\nInformed infosec people on Twitter have suggested sysadmins should disable the Windows print spool service as an immediate mitigation for PrintNightmare.\nMatthew \u201cHacker Fantastic\u201d Hickey told The Register: \"In my opinion this is the most significant incident to happen to Windows enterprise systems this year and people need to prioritize disabling the print spooler service on domain controllers and mission critical servers to prevent exploitation of this issue.\nHe told us the exploit works \"on a fully patched and updated (as of yesterday) Windows 2019 domain controller,\" as seen on Hickey's posted screenshot of his test system with \"the exploit being used.\"\nFully patched Windows 2019 domain controller, popped with 0day exploit (CVE-2021-1675) from a regular Domain User's account giving full SYSTEM privileges. Disable \"Print Spooler\" service on servers that do not require it. pic.twitter.com/6SUVQYy5Tl\nHe added: \"It works from any domain user to exploit any network server using the print spooler service, which is enabled by default on domain controllers.\n\"Ransomware gangs will be quick to use this in their attacks and previously compromised low-value desktops could be used to take control of the entire Windows estate using this bug to then deliver their malware.\"\nMartin Lee, technical lead at Cisco Talos, said: \"Exploits such as this underline how important it is to both securely authenticate users and be in a position to identify unusual network activity.\n\"Escalation of privilege vulnerabilities continue to be discovered, meaning that we must ensure that lost or stolen credentials cannot be used on their own to authenticate a user to a domain.\n\"Equally, security teams need to be equipped with the tools that allow the identification and triage of unusual network activity. An unprivileged user uploading a new printer driver to the print server isn't an everyday occurrence and should raise suspicions.\"\nOnce the proof-of-concept exploit code for PrintNightmare was shared on GitHub by its authors \u2013 the Shenzhen-based infosec firm Sangfor Technologies \u2013 earlier this week, it was forked and copied by miscreants.\nSangfor was due to present at Black Hat USA a set of closely related vulns, with its presentation summary on the Black Hat website stating: \"We started to explore the inner working of Printer Spooler and discovered some 0-day Bugs in it. Some of them are more powerful than PrintDemon and easier to exploit, and the others can be triggered from remote which could lead to remote code execution.\"\nThe team took down its code pretty quickly after sharing it. Last time we looked, it was available in the Google Search cache, and searching for the CVE number on Twitter and other social media returns links to the cached version of the code, forks, and more, though.\nWe deleted the POC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service. For more RCE and LPE in Spooler, stay tuned and wait our Blackhat talk. https://t.co/heHeiTCsbQ\nIf you haven't installed the latest batch of Windows updates on your system, do so now and disable the print spool service. Depending on your configuration, the June 8 patch may or may not thwart PrintNightmare; it's not entirely clear, as this Twitter thread by Mimikatz creator Benjamin Delpy demonstrates. Switching off the spool service entirely, and installing the June patches is the best course of action right now.\nWe have asked Microsoft when a fresh patch will be available, and we have also asked Sangfor to comment. \u00ae\nEditor's note: This article was revised after publication to include a timeline of PrintNightmare's disclosure.\nThe dodgy use of personal data by rogue organisations in fraud and scams continues to be the biggest data protection bugbear for people in the UK, according to research from the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).\nWhen quizzed about which data protection issue is most pressing,\u00a0rather than citing privacy issues \u2013\u00a0the UK survey's 2,102 adult respondents, polled between 6 and 18 May, said their top concern was that \"personal information [is] being used for scams or fraud.\"\nWhat's more, organisations with a poor record on keeping people's data safe or not using it properly \u2013 such as those who pepper the public with unwanted marketing calls \u2013 are likely to find themselves scratched off people's Xmas card list.\nBT says it has reached an agreement with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) over disputes concerning pay and redundancy - and in doing so looks to have averted the union's threat of running a national ballot for strike action.\nOn 12 May, on the eve of the scheduled national ballot, BT agreed to pause all compulsory job losses under its multi-year company transformation programme, one that involves expunging 13,000 employees and dumping 90 per cent of its real estate, among other measures, to reduce annual operating costs by \u00a31.5bn.\nIn such an all-encompassing initiative, BT's closure of sites and reduction in headcount sufficiently annoyed unionised employees, who tried to make their voices heard though the CWU's Count Me In Campaign.\nOpenUK has released the second of its three-part probe into the state of open source in Britain, finding that an overwhelming majority of businesses use the wares \u2013 but noticeably fewer are willing to contribute code back.\n\"The first of its kind, this report makes visible the current business adoption of open source software in the UK and provides a baseline of what will be an annual review \u2013 to capture the growth, shifts and changes of open source software use in the UK in the coming years,\" claimed Jennifer Barth, PhD, founder of consultancy firm Smoothmedia and the leader of the research which led to the report.\nIntel has officially discontinued Lakefield, its first Foveros-based \"Hybrid Technology\" processor, citing shifting demand \u2013 but is keeping mum on what that means for the Foveros concept in general.\nIntel first unveiled Lakefield, though without mentioning the name, and its underlying Foveros tech in late 2018 as an answer to Arm's big.LITTLE and later DynamIQ: a way to pair high-power cores with slower but more efficient ones, while also mixing and matching semiconductor manufacturing process nodes to release pressure on its troubled 10nm lines.\nLakefield itself wouldn't be named until January 2019, with a Foveros implementation aimed at ultra-portable and dual-display laptops which packed a single 10nm Sunny Cove high-performance core alongside four Tremont Atom-based energy-efficient cores, all sandwiched between RAM and input/output hardware built on a 22nm process.\nThe majority of YouTube videos that netizens taking part in a study said they regretted watching were recommended by the website's space-age AI algorithms.\n\u201cThis problem with YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm is part of a bigger story about the opaque, mysterious influence that commercial algorithms can have on our lives,\u201d the Mozilla-led study, released on Wednesday, concluded.\n\u201cYouTube\u2019s algorithm drives an estimated 700 million hours of watch time every single day, and yet the public knows very little about how it works.

Microsoft classified these vulnerabilities as critical, but when they were published they were able to fix only one of them, leaving the door open for explorations of the second vulnerability,\" Balmas added.\nPrintNightmare stems from bugs in the Windows Print Spooler service, which manages the printing process inside local networks. The main concern with the threat is that non-administrator users had the ability to load their own printer drivers. This has now been rectified.\n\"After installing this [update] and later Windows updates, users who are not administrators can only install signed print drivers to a print server,\" Microsoft said, detailing the improvements made to mitigate the risks associated with the flaw. \"Administrator credentials will be required to install unsigned printer drivers on a printer server going forward.\"\nPost the update's release, CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann cautioned that the patch \"only appears to address the Remote Code Execution (RCE via SMB and RPC) variants of the PrintNightmare, and not the Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) variant,\" thereby allowing attackers to abuse the latter to gain SYSTEM privileges on vulnerable systems.\nNow, further testing of the update has revealed that exploits targeting the flaw could bypass the remediations entirely to gain both local privilege escalation and remote code execution. To achieve this, however, a Windows policy called 'Point and Print Restrictions' must be enabled (Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Printers: Point and Print Restrictions), using which malicious printer drivers could be potentially installed.\n\"Note that the Microsoft update for CVE-2021-34527 does not effectively prevent exploitation of systems where the Point and Print NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall is set to 1,\" Dormann said Wednesday. Microsoft, for its part, explains in its advisory that \"Point and Print is not directly related to this vulnerability, but the technology weakens the local security posture in such a way that exploitation will be possible.\"\nWhile Microsoft has recommended the nuclear option of stopping and disabling the Print Spooler service, an alternative workaround is to enable security prompts for Point and Print, and limit printer driver installation privileges to administrators alone by configuring the \"RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators\" registry value to prevent regular users from installing printer drivers on a print server.\nSign up for cybersecurity newsletter and get latest news updates delivered straight to your inbox daily."

CERT/CC is part of the Software Engineering Institute, a federally funded research center operated by Carnegie Mellon University.\n\u201cWhile Microsoft has released an update for CVE-2021-1675, it is important to realize that this update does NOT protect Active Directory domain controllers, or systems that have Point and Print configured with the NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall option configured,\u201d CERT/CC researchers wrote in the note.\nThe mitigation is in response to a scenario that unfolded earlier this week when a proof-of-concept (POC) for PrintNightmare was dropped on GitHub on Tuesday. While it was taken back down within a few hours, the code was copied and remains in circulation on the platform. An attacker can use the POC to exploit the vulnerability to take control of an affected system.\nIn the meantime, Microsoft Thursday put out a new advisory of its own on PrintNightmare that assigns a new CVE and seems to suggest a new attack vector while attempting to clarify confusion that has arisen over it.\nWhile the company originally addressed CVE-2021-1675 in June\u2019s Patch Tuesday updates as a minor elevation-of-privilege vulnerability, the listing was updated last week after researchers from Tencent and NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab figured out it could be used for RCE.\nHowever, soon after it became clear to many experts that the patch appears to fail against the RCE aspect of the bug\u2014hence CISA\u2019s offer of another mitigation and Microsoft\u2019s update.\nRegarding the latter, the company dropped a notice Thursday for a bug called \u201cWindows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u201d that appears to be the same vulnerability, but with a different CVE number\u2014in this case, CVE-2021-34527.\nThe description of the bug sounds like PrintNightmare; indeed, Microsoft acknowledges that it is \u201can evolving situation.\n\u201cA remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Print Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations,\u201d according to the notice. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\u201d\nIn a \u201cFAQ\u201d section in the security update, Microsoft attempts to explain CVE-2021-34527\u2019s connection to CVE-2021-1675.\n\u201cIs this the vulnerability that has been referred to publicly as PrintNightmare? Yes, Microsoft has assigned CVE-2021-34527 to this vulnerability,\u201d the company wrote.\nHowever, the answer to the question \u201cIs this vulnerability related to CVE-2021-1675?\u201d suggests that CVE-2021-34527 is a different issue.\n\u201cThis vulnerability is similar but distinct from the vulnerability that is assigned CVE-2021-1675, which addresses a different vulnerability in RpcAddPrinterDriverEx(),\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThe attack vector is different as well. CVE-2021-1675 was addressed by the June 2021 security update.\u201d\nMicrosoft goes on to explain that CVE-2021-34527 existed before the June Patch Tuesday updates and that it affects domain controllers in \u201call versions of Windows.\u201d\n\u201cWe are still investigating whether all versions are exploitable,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cWe will update this CVE when that information is evident.\u201d\nMicrosoft did not assign a score to CVE-2021-34527, citing its ongoing investigation.\nIn retrospect, one security researcher noted to Threatpost when news of PrintNightmare surfaced Tuesday that it was \u201ccurious\u201d that the CVE for the original vulnerability was \u201c-1675,\u201d observing that \u201cmost of the CVEs Microsoft patched in June are -31000 and higher.\u201d\n\u201cThis could be an indicator that they have known about this bug for some time, and fully addressing it is not trivial,\u201d Dustin Childs of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative told Threatpost at the time.\nNow it appears that perhaps Microsoft was patching only part of a more complex vulnerability. The likely scenario appears to be that there are two bugs in Windows Print Spooler that could offer attackers some kind of exploit chain or be used separately to take over systems.\nWhile one flaw may indeed have been addressed in June\u2019s Patch Tuesday update, the other could be mitigated by CERT/CC\u2019s workaround\u2014or could remain to be patched by a future Microsoft update that comes after the company completes its investigation.\nThe company\u2019s release Thursday of a new CVE related to PrintNightmare seems to be an initial attempt to clarify the situation, though given its developing nature, it remains a bit hazy for now.\nCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in the ERP platform could allow attackers to tamper with or sabotage victims\u2019 business-critical processes and to intercept data.\nThreat actors enlist compromised WordPress websites in campaign targeting macOS users.\nDavid \u201cmoose\u201d Wolpoff, CTO at Randori, discusses security appliances and VPNs and how attackers only have to \u201cpick one lock\u201d to invade an enterprise through them.\nNotify me when new comments are added.\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Having seen that this patch had been published, security researchers then released technical details of what they thought was the same vulnerability, along with a proof-of-concept. But they had in fact released information about a different -- albeit similar -- vulnerability.\nWhen Microsoft patched the high-severity CVE-2021-1675, it was classed as a privilege escalation issue. But shortly after issuing the patch, the company revised its assessment, reclassifying it as a critical remote code execution flaw.\nAs explained by Bleeping Computer, towards the end of last month, researchers from Chinese security firm QiAnXin published a video showing that they had been able to achieve privilege escalation and remote code execution with the vulnerability. Then researchers from Sangfor -- another Chinese security firm -- got a little mixed up and published a technical write up of what they thought was the same bug, calling it PrintNightmare.\nBut in reality, PrintNightmare and CVE-2021-1675 are different vulnerabilities, so Sangfor had effectively revealed how to exploit a serious, unpatched vulnerability.

The vulnerability, tracked under CVE-2021-34527, is present in the Windows Print Spooler service and is termed print \"PrintNightmare\" that can allow for remote code execution (RCE). As the vulnerability was still being investigated, the Redmond firm listed two possible workarounds to mitigate the risks caused by the bug.\nToday, the firm has provided an update in the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) listing for the vulnerability noting that it is rolling out a patch for the latest Windows 10 versions to address the issue. The update, KB5004945, is currently rolling out to the three most recent Windows 10 versions, 2004, 20H2, and 21H1, bumping them to Windows 10 builds 19041.1083, 19042.1083, and 19043.1083, respectively. Since these versions are based on the same codebase, the updates are identical for all the versions. The changelog and documentation for the update are yet to go live.\nConsidering that these are security updates to fix a critical vulnerability, they are mandatory updates and are downloaded automatically through Windows Update. Users can also manually download the patch from the Update Catalog here. Future patches, such as the upcoming Patch Tuesday updates, will contain these fixes.\nThere is no word from the firm on how the vulnerability affects older versions of the OS, though it notes that it has completed the investigation of the issue. The updates today are only rolling out to the three most recent and fully supported Windows 10 versions, but it will not be surprising to see a patch being made available for older versions still being supported for Enterprise and Education customers sooner, as the firm notes that supported Windows versions that do not receive an update today will get one \"shortly after July 6\".\nFor those unaware, the PrintNightmare vulnerability is caused by the Print Spooler service not restricting access to a function that is used to install printer drivers remotely. An attacker that gains unrestricted access can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, examples of which are already available on the web. Considering the severity of the vulnerability, it is best for all users to update to the latest build as soon as possible.\nUpdate: The patches are available for most supported Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 7 (ESU users). You can either update via Windows Update, or head to the MSRC document to find links to the requisite Update Catalog pages. The company has also provided the KB article links, but as is the case these days, those pages are yet to be updated. Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016 are yet to receive updates.\nUpdate 2: The KB articles are now live for those interested in reading through the changelog. For Windows 10, the changelog is mostly similar across versions. Here is how the firm details the update:\nAddresses a remote code execution exploit in the Windows Print Spooler service, known as \u201cPrintNightmare\u201d, as documented in CVE-2021-34527. After installing this and later Windows updates, users who are not administrators can only install signed print drivers to a print server. By default, administrators can install signed and unsigned printer drivers to a print server. The installed root certificates in the system\u2019s Trusted Root Certification Authorities trusts signed drivers. Microsoft recommends that you immediately install this update on all supported Windows client and server operating system, starting with devices that currently host the print server role. You also have the option to configure the RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators registry setting to prevent non-administrators from installing signed printer drivers on a print server.

And they released some proof-of-concept code that exploited a remote code execution security hole in Windows Print Spooler.\nPresumably they thought Microsoft had fixed the vulnerability by issuing the patch.  They were planning to present at the upcoming Black Hat conference all about their research into Windows Print Spooler bugs, and they thought \u2013 well, if Microsoft has already patched the bug then we might as well talk about it now and show off how clever we are\u2026\nAhh well.  Here\u2019s where the problem is.\nYou see, the bug that the researchers exploited in their proof-of-concept code was not actually the same security hole that Microsoft patched against last month.\nCorrect.\nOh dear. But surely all they have to do is take down their code?\nAnd to their credit, the researchers realised their mistake and have done exactly that.\nWe deleted the POC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service. For more RCE and LPE in Spooler, stay tuned and wait our Blackhat talk. https://t.co/heHeiTCsbQ\nBut they didn\u2019t act quite quickly enough.  Pandora\u2019s box was opened \u2013 and the code is now out in the wild.\nYup.\nMake sure you are running the latest Windows security updates.  They may not defend your systems against a PrintNightmare attack, but they\u2019re still helpful.\nIn addition, some are suggesting that you disable the Print Spooler service on vulnerable PCs, and limit network access to servers where you feel you need to keep the Print Spooler running.  If Print Spooler is running on any devices that don\u2019t actually need it, disable it as that will help reduce the attack surface.\nAnd wait for a security update from Microsoft.\nFound this article interesting?

This is a security concern, and this vulnerability affects the Print Spooler service allowing hackers to install apps easily, manipulate private data, and even create full-fledged accounts on your computer.\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how to mitigate PrintNightmare Print Spooler vulnerability on Windows 10 computers.\nSince there is no permanent fix as of yet, it is essential to do something about this. Sangfor researchers published the vulnerability, and even though it was deleted quickly, the code was placed on GitHub. This gave others access to a threat before it could be removed. Microsoft is looking for solutions and has suggested that users should temporarily disable the Windows Print Spooler service.\nStep-1: Go to the Start Menu and type PowerShell.\nStep-2: Select Run as administrator.\nStep-3: You will be asked; do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device? Click Yes.\nStep-5: Now type this command and prevent Enter. This is to prevent the Spooler from starting again when your computer restarts.\nAfter this, your computer will be protected, but you won\u2019t be able to print locally or remotely.\nIf you need to print or the vulnerability issue has been resolved by Microsoft, you can enable the feature again.\nThis method is for users who have the Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise edition installed on their computers. This method will not work for you if you have the Windows 10 Home version.\nStep-1: Open the Run box with the shortcut keys Win + R.\nStep-2: Type gpedit.msc in the type box and press Enter.\nStep-4: Scroll down and double-click on Allow Print Spooler to accept client connections.\nStep-5: Select Disabled.\nStep-6: Click on Apply and then press OK.\nAfter disabling Print Spooler, you will be able to lessen the risk of hackers accessing your computer.

No patch has yet been released for the new CVE, but additional information and mitigation options are offered in the advisory.\nUpdate July 1: The Background and Solution sections have been updated based on new information. Reports indicate the available patch does not completely address the vulnerability as demonstrated by multiple proofs-of-concept.\nAt the end of June, two different research teams published information about CVE-2021-1675, a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. The name that has been named PrintNightmare is being used to refer to the PoC and vulnerability interchangeably across several sources, though it remains unclear currently if this moniker was intended for the newly released patch bypass, additional Print Spooler vulnerabilities which sources claim exist or CVE-2021-1675.\nOn July 1, Microsoft released an advisory for CVE-2021-34527, which the advisory acknowledges as the vulnerability known as PrintNightmare. Though the advisory does not offer much detail, Microsoft does note that this new CVE is a distinct and separate issue from the flaw addressed by CVE-2021-1675.\nWhen it was originally disclosed in the June Patch Tuesday update, it was described as a low severity elevation of privilege vulnerability. That designation was updated on June 21 to indicate a critical severity and the potential for RCE. Discovery was credited to Zhipeng Huo of Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, Piotr Madej of AFINE and Yunhai Zhang of NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab.\nOn June 27, the research team at QiAnXin tweeted a GIF demonstrating successful exploitation of CVE-2021-1675 to gain RCE without any technical details or proof-of-concept (PoC) code.\nRecently, we found right approaches to exploit #CVE-2021-1675 successfully, both #LPE and #RCE. It is interesting that the vulnerability was classified into #LPE only by Microsoft, however, it was changed into Remote Code Execution recently.https://t.co/PQO3B12hoE pic.twitter.com/kbYknK9fBw\nOn June 29, researchers at a different firm, Sangfor, published a full technical write-up with PoC code to GitHub. That repository, however, was taken down after only a few hours. It is unclear if the researchers decided to share their PoC because of the tweet from QiAnXin. The researchers claim to have discovered this vulnerability independently from those credited with the disclosure by Microsoft.\nWe deleted the POC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service. For more RCE and LPE in Spooler, stay tuned and wait our Blackhat talk. https://t.co/heHeiTCsbQ\nWhile they did not explicitly confirm the reason for removal of the PoC, it appears the researchers were concerned about giving too much information away publicly before their upcoming Black Hat USA presentation on this vulnerability.\nUnfortunately, the GitHub repository was publicly available long enough for others to clone it. The PoC is likely still circulating and is likely to resurface publicly, if it hasn\u2019t already done so.\nExploitation of CVE-2021-1675 could give remote attackers full control of vulnerable systems. To achieve RCE, attackers would need to target a user authenticated to the spooler service. Without authentication, the flaw could be exploited to elevate privileges, making this vulnerability a valuable link in an attack chain.\nCVE-2021-34527, announced on July 1, is also an RCE vulnerability within the Windows Print Spooler service. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would allow attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, though still requires an authenticated user account as with CVE-2021-1675.\nWindows Print Spooler has a long history of vulnerabilities and its ubiquity can allow for serious impact on targets. Most notably, Print Spooler vulnerabilities were tied to the Stuxnet attacks over a decade ago. More recently, CVE-2020-1337 was a zero-day in print spooler disclosed at last year\u2019s Black Hat and DEF CON events, which happened to be a patch bypass for CVE-2020-1048, another Windows Print Spooler vulnerability that was patched in May 2020.\nCVE-2021-1675 was patched as part of Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday release on June 8, 2021. However, the CERT/CC issued Vulnerability Note VU#383432 late on June 30 indicating that the original patch does not fix the flaws illustrated in the PoCs.\nIn the CVE-2021-34527 advisory released on July 1, Microsoft offers two mitigation options that can be used until a patch is released. Both of the migitations will affect printing operations so organizations should take care to ensure they understand what business operations could be impacted. The advisory still stresses the importance of applying the June patch to address CVE-2021-1675 and clarifies that CVE-2021-34527 is a separate vulnerability with a different attack vector.\nIn addition, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an alert about PrintNighmare recommending administrators to follow Microsoft\u2019s best practices from a how-to guide on Windows Print spooler service in Domain Controllers for those that are unable to disable the service in domain controllers and systems that do not need the ability to print.\nVulnerabilities like this are most likely to be used in targeted attacks, but all users and organizations are encouraged to patch quickly.\nA list of Tenable plugins to identify CVE-2021-1675 can be found here.\nJoin Tenable's Security Response Team on the Tenable Community.\nLearn more about Tenable, the first Cyber Exposure platform for holistic management of your modern attack surface.\nGet a free 30-day trial of Tenable.io Vulnerability Management.\nEnter your email to receive the latest cyber exposure alerts in your inbox.\n\u00a9 2021 Tenable\u00ae, Inc.

Microsoft had already published fixes for a different Print Spooler problem. So Sangfor might have thought this one was patched and okay to talk about publicly.\nIn terms of how serious this vulnerability is, a BleepingComputer report notes that the remote code execution that allows hackers to take over servers with system privileges would enable them to \u201cinstall programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.\u201d\nAs of the time of this writing, BleepingComputer goes on to warn that no security updates are available to address the PrintNightmare zero-day vulnerability. Microsoft is apparently still in the investigating phase of this problem as it works toward a fix for it.\nTwo other critical points: Again, Microsoft confirmed that hackers have definitely exploited this vulnerability already. One step Windows users can take is making sure they\u2019ve installed security updates released around the beginning of June.\nOther reports have noted that Windows users can disable the Printer Spooler service. Additionally, users can disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy.\nAndy is a reporter in Memphis who also contributes to outlets like Fast Company and The Guardian.

This remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affects all versions of Microsoft Windows.\n*Please note: Tenable\u2019s Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) scores are calculated nightly. This blog post was published on July 7 and reflects VPR at that time.\nMicrosoft originally released its advisory for CVE-2021-34527 on July 1. This advisory was released in\u00a0response to public reports about a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2021-1675, a similar vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. To help clear up confusion about the vulnerability, Microsoft updated its advisory for CVE-2021-1675 to clarify that it is \u201csimilar but distinct from CVE-2021-34527.\u201d\nCVE-2021-34527 is an RCE vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler Service, which is available across desktop and server versions of Windows operating systems. The service is used to manage printers and print servers. The vulnerability exists because the service does not handle privileged file operations properly.\nAn authenticated, remote or local attacker, could exploit this flaw in order to gain arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.\nSince July 1, researchers have been diligently developing PoCs for PrintNightmare. At the time this blog post was published, there were at least 34 public PoC exploit scripts for PrintNightmare on GitHub.\nThese PoCs include scripts that can achieve local privilege escalation (LPE) on a targeted system, as well as remote code execution.\nPrevious PoCs relied on the Microsoft Print System Remote Protocol (MS-RPRN) to exploit PrintNightmare. However, on July 3, a researcher going by the nickname cube0x0, developed a PoC called SharpPrintNightmare, which uses the Microsoft Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol (MS-PAR) instead, which confirmed that PrintNightmare could be successfully exploited against servers and desktop systems as well as domain controllers.\nDisabling spooler on just your DC's is not enough #PrintNightmare pic.twitter.com/IJJ2S2Ejxs\nBenjamin Delpy, developer of the comprehensive post-exploitation tool Mimikatz, updated the software to add support for the PrintNightmare exploit using cube0x0\u2019s method.\nAt the time this blog post was published, several researchers including Kevin Beaumont, Will Dormann and Hacker Fantastic, have pointed out that the fix for PrintNightmare is incomplete, as the LPE still works successfully post-patch, both \u201cout of the box\u201d as well as under certain configurations.\nAdditionally, there are reports that both RCE and LPE is still feasible post-patch, so long as the Point and Print configuration is enabled.\nTenable has not independently confirmed these findings.\nAs mentioned above, there are a number of PoC exploit scripts for PrintNightmare available on GitHub.\nAs of July 7, Microsoft released patches for a number of different Windows releases. The following table can be used to reference each patch and its associated knowledge base entry.\nMicrosoft updated its advisory on July 7 to address the Point and Print aspect of this vulnerability. Specifically, they mention that while Point and Print is \u201cnot directly related to this vulnerability\u201d its usage \u201cweakens the local security posture\u201d allowing for exploitation even if patches have been applied.\nNote: These keys do not exist in the registry by default and must be added to disable Point and Print for non-administrative users.\nAdditionally, Microsoft Security Response Center released a blog post to announce that the cumulative patch released for CVE-2021-34527 also includes a new feature that provides users with the ability to allow non-administrative users to only install signed printer drivers which are trusted by \u201cthe installed root certificates in the system\u2019s Trusted Root Certification Authorities\u201d.

                    "value": "Microsoft has started releasing emergency security updates to fix a publicly disclosed remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows printing functionality that could allow attackers to take full control of vulnerable systems.\nThe vulnerability, dubbed PrintNightmare and tracked as CVE-2021-34527, is located in the Windows Print Spooler service and the public exploits available for it are being improved. Organizations are urged to deploy the patches as soon as possible or disable inbound remote printing until the patches can be applied.\n[ Learn how to harden Windows 10 for maximum security. | Get the latest from CSO by signing up for our newsletters. ]\nMicrosoft's June monthly updates included a patch for another vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service tracked as CVE-2021-1675 that was initially described as a local privilege escalation (LPE) issue. The vulnerability's discovery was credited to Zhipeng Huo of Tencent Security, Piotr Madej of Afine, and Yunhai Zhang of Nsfocus.\nOn June 29, two other security researchers, Zhiniang Peng and Xuefeng Li from Sangfor, published an analysis of CVE-2021-1675 in which they demonstrated that the flaw can also be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) and not just privilege escalation. The researchers said they had also discovered the flaw independently before it was reported to Microsoft as part of a larger security analysis of the Windows printing functionality. The two plan to present their findings, which include additional vulnerabilities, at the upcoming BlackHat USA security conference in a talk titled \"Diving Into Spooler: Discovering LPE and RCE Vulnerabilities in Windows Printer.\"\nWhat the Sangfor researchers didn't realize when they posted their CVE-2021-1675 RCE analysis under the name PrintNightmare, was that they were actually describing a very similar, but ultimately different vulnerability that Microsoft's June patch did not protect against. Microsoft reviewed their report and updated its CVE-2021-1675 advisory to describe it as an RCE vulnerability instead of LPE and also created a new advisory for the new PrintNightmare flaw, assigning it the CVE-2021-34527 ID.\nZhiniang Peng and Xuefeng Li removed their proof-of-concept exploit when they realized the confusion, but it was already too late and other researchers started analyzing and expanding on it. There are now at least three public proof-of-concept exploit implementations for this vulnerability, and some have additional attack vectors.\nThe original exploit used the Print System Remote Protocol (MS-RPRN), which limited the exploit to Windows servers configured as domain controllers or Windows 10 machines with non-default settings such as User Account Control (UAC) disabled or PointAndPrint NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall enabled. Then another researcher known online as Cube0x0 figured out how the exploit can also be used through the Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol (MS-PAR). According to Mimikatz developer Benjamin Delpy, this makes PrintNightmare exploitation possible on more Windows machines with default configurations, not just domain controllers. Delpy implemented the functionality in Mimikatz, an open-source tool that's popular with penetration testers and malicious hackers alike.\nWith the amount of public information available and exploit implementations, security researchers believe that it's only a matter of time until these exploits will be used in the wild, if they haven't been already. Microsoft's advisory states that all editions of Windows are affected and that exploitation for this vulnerability has been detected.\nMicrosoft released patches Tuesday for a large number of affected Windows versions\u2014the links are in the advisory\u2014but not yet for Windows 10 1607, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016. In addition, researchers from 0patch.com, a service that develops so-called micropatches that can be applied to processes directly in memory, have released free patches that they claim also work for the missing Windows versions and protect against all currently known attack vectors.\nAccording to an advisory by the CERT Coordination Center, the available updates from Microsoft only mitigate the remote code execution variants of the exploits and not the local privilege escalation ones. That's why the CERT/CC analysts recommend also applying the following manual workarounds suggested by Microsoft.\nImpact of workaround: Disabling the Print Spooler service disables the ability to print both locally and remotely.\nImpact of workaround: This policy will block the remote attack vector by preventing inbound remote printing operations. The system will no longer function as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still be possible.\nLucian Constantin is a senior writer at CSO, covering information security, privacy, and data protection.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 IDG Communications, Inc.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 IDG Communications, Inc."

Administrator credentials will be required to install unsigned printer drivers on a printer server going forward.\"\nCISA's advice for this bug is available\u00a0here.\nHowever, via The Register, the creator of the Mimikatz penetrating testing kit, said he has found a way to bypass the patch on systems by using UNC or the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) string, which is used to point to shared files or devices. Reportedly, Microsoft's patch for CVE-2021-34527 improperly checks remote libraries; it doesn't check for UNC for pointing to remote files.\nAnd security researcher Will Dormann notes that certain registry settings that are meant to mitigate the bug don't prevent local privilege escalation (LCE) or remote code execution (RCE).\nConfirmed.If you have a system where PointAndPrint NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall = 1, then Microsoft's patch for #PrintNightmare CVE-2021-34527 does nothing to prevent either LPE or RCE. https://t.co/RgIc1yrnhn pic.twitter.com/Ntxe9wpuke\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\nBy registering, you agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices outlined in the Privacy Policy.\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update Today and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

This was primarily an interim measure ahead of issuing the emergency updates, but still applies to those unable to implement the latest updates.\nThe Windows Print Spooler vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-34527 by Microsoft. It has been given a Common Vulnerability Scoring System base rating of 8.8, which is close to a critical score of 9.\nExploiting this remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service enables attackers to perform unauthorized privileged file operations, says Microsoft. The company describes how an attacker could use the vulnerability exploit to run arbitrary code with system privileges; install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nFor organizations unable to implement the security updates, Microsoft advises disabling the Windows Print Spooler service at least for inbound remote printing through Group Policy. \"Group policy will block the remote attack vector by preventing inbound remote printing operations. The system will no longer function as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still be possible,\" Microsoft notes.\nUsers should also apply the patch released on June 8, 2021, for an earlier flaw assigned CVE-2021-1675 which addresses a different vulnerability in RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() using a different attack vector. The RpcAddPrinterDriverEx() function is used to install a printer driver on a system.\nMicrosoft also recommends organizations use tooling such as Microsoft Defender 365 to monitor potentially malicious activity.\nPrior to the emergency updates being issued, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also issued a warning urging administrators to disable the Windows Print Spooler service in Domain Controllers and systems that do not print.\n\"Additionally, administrators should employ the following best practice from Microsoft\u2019s how-to guides, published Jan. 11, 2021: \u201cDue to the possibility for exposure, domain controllers and Active Directory admin systems need to have the Print spooler service disabled.

                    "value": "This week, PrintNightmare - Microsoft's Print Spooler vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) was upgraded from a 'Low' criticality to a 'Critical' criticality.\nThis is due to a Proof of Concept published on GitHub, which attackers could potentially leverage for gaining access to Domain Controllers.\nAs we reported earlier, Microsoft already released a patch in June 2021, but it wasn't enough to stop exploits. Attackers can still use Print Spooler when connecting remotely. You can find all you need to know about this vulnerability in this article and how you can mitigate it (and you can).\nPrint Spooler in a nutshell: Print Spooler is Microsoft's service for managing and monitoring files printing. This service is among Microsoft's oldest and has had minimal maintenance updates since it was released.\nEvery Microsoft machine (servers and endpoints) has this feature enabled by default.\nPrintNightmare vulnerability: As soon as an attacker gains limited user access to a network, he will be able to connect (directly or remotely) to the Print Spooler. Since the Print Spooler has direct access to the kernel, the attacker can use it to gain access to the operating system, run remote code with system privileges, and ultimately attack the Domain Controller.\nYour best option when it comes to mitigating the PrintNightmare vulnerability is to disable the Print Spooler on every server and/or sensitive workstation (such as administrators' workstations, direct internet-facing workstations, and non-printing workstations).\nThis is what Dvir Goren's, hardening expert and CTO at CalCom Software Solutions, suggests as your first move towards mitigation.\nAccording to Dvir's experience, 90% of servers do not require Print Spooler. It is the default configuration for most of them, so it is usually enabled. As a result, disabling it can solve 90% of your problem and have little impact on production.\nIn large and complex infrastructures, it can be challenging to locate where Print Spooler is used.\nBeside this, to find potential evidence of exploitation, you should also monitor Microsoft-Windows-PrintService/Admin log entries. There might be entries with error messages that indicate Print Spooler can't load plug-in module DLLs, although this can also happen if an attacker packaged a legitimate DLL that Print Spooler demands.\nThe final recommendation from Dvir is to implement these recommendations through hardening automation tools. Without automation, you will spend countless hours attempting to harden manually and may end up vulnerable or causing systems to go down\nAfter choosing your course of action, a Hardening automation tool will discover where Print Spooler is enabled, where they are actually used, and disable or reconfigure them automatically.\nSign up for cybersecurity newsletter and get latest news updates delivered straight to your inbox daily."

Print Spooler manages the printing process in Windows, including loading the appropriate printer drivers and scheduling the print job for printing, among others.\nPrint Spooler flaws are concerning, not least because of the wide attack surface, but also owing to the fact that it runs at the highest privilege level and is capable of dynamically loading third-party binaries.\nThe Windows maker addressed the vulnerability as part of its Patch Tuesday update on June 8, 2021. But almost two weeks later, Microsoft revised the flaw's impact from an elevation of privilege to remote code execution (RCE) as well as upgraded the severity level from Important to Critical.\n\"Either the attacker exploits the vulnerability by accessing the target system locally (e.g., keyboard, console), or remotely (e.g., SSH); or the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., tricking a legitimate user into opening a malicious document),\" Microsoft said in its advisory.\nThings took a turn when Chinese security firm QiAnXin earlier this week disclosed it was able to find the \"right approaches\" to leverage the flaw, thereby demonstrating a successful exploitation to achieve RCE.\nAlthough the researchers refrained from sharing additional technical specifics, Hong Kong-based cybersecurity company Sangfor published what's an independent deep-dive of the same vulnerability to GitHub, along with a fully working PoC code, where it remained publicly accessible before it was taken offline a few hours later.\nSangfor codenamed the vulnerability \"PrintNightmare.\"\n\"We deleted the PoC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service,\" tweeted Sangfor's Principal Security Researcher Zhiniang Peng. The findings are expected to be presented at the Black Hat USA conference next month.\nWindows Print Spooler has long been a source of security vulnerabilities, with Microsoft fixing at least three issues \u2014 CVE-2020-1048, CVE-2020-1300, and CVE-2020-1337 \u2014 in the past year alone. Notably, a flaw in the service was also abused to gain remote access and propagate the Stuxnet worm in 2010 targeting Iranian nuclear installations.\nUpdate \u2014 There are now indications that the fix released by Microsoft for the critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print spooler service in June does not completely remediate the root cause of the bug, according to the CERT Coordination Center, raising the possibility that it's a zero-day flaw in need of a patch.\n\"While Microsoft has released an update for CVE-2021-1675, it is important to realize that this update does not address the public exploits that also identify as CVE-2021-1675,\" CERT/CC's Will Dormann said in a vulnerability note published Wednesday.\nIt's worth noting that the successful exploitation of CVE-2021-1675 could open the door to complete system takeover by remote adversaries.

At this time, organizations are recommended to disable the Windows Print Spooler service on all Domain Controllers until patch validity is confirmed.\nThe vulnerability is classified as Remote Code Execution (RCE). Exploitation could allow a threat actor to take full control of vulnerable systems.  Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit code was publicly released on June 29th.\nCurrently, security patches are not available for all impacted Microsoft products. Additional security patches are expected in the foreseeable future.\nThe public release of PoC code significantly reduces the barriers for exploitation. Microsoft has stated that exploitation of PrintNightmare has been identified. Organizations are strongly recommended to disable the Windows Print Spooler service, where not required, until fully functional and tested security patches are available.\nExternal sources have stated that for the OoB security patches to be effective, the Windows policy 'Point and Print Restrictions' must be disabled. This is the standard configuration on Windows devices. This can be verified by adding the following registry modifications:\nPrintNightmare was originally tracked as CVE-2021-1675. Microsoft has since stated the vulnerability is unique from\u202fCVE-2021-1675 and is officially tracked as CVE-2021-34527. The July 6th security patches for CVE-2021-34527 are cumulative updates and cover CVE-2021-1675.\nCVE-2021-34527 (CVSS: 8.8) is classified as a Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution vulnerability. A threat actor with local access to a vulnerable asset may exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary code with system privileges.\nThe newly released security patches only mitigate the Remote Code Execution (RCE) portion of PrintNightmare. The local privilege escalation portion of the vulnerability still exists after patching. A threat actor with previous access may exploit the vulnerability to escalate privileges on the victim device despite the security patches. Additional patches from Microsoft are expected in the near future to address the risk of patch bypass, outstanding products that still require patches, and the local privilege escalation vulnerability.\nThe PoC exploit code was originally planned to be released by a security firm at BlackHat USA but was released in error on June 29th. The code was publicly available for multiple hours before being taken down. The security company plans to officially release the code and additional details at BlackHat USA in July 2021. eSentire has confirmed that despite the code takedown, it was copied and remains publicly available.\n[1] https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527[2] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/cas-isp-print-spooler[3] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004945-os-builds-19041-1083-19042-1083-and-19043-1083-out-of-band-44b34928-0a71-4473-aa22-ecf3b83eed0e[4] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004946-os-build-18363-1646-out-of-band-18c5ffac-6015-4b3a-ba53-a73c3d3ed505[5] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004950-os-build-10240-18969-out-of-band-7f900b36-b3cb-4f5e-8eca-107cc0d91c50[6] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004947-os-build-17763-2029-out-of-band-71994811-ff08-4abe-8986-8bd3a4201c5d[7] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004958-security-only-update-out-of-band-d439df52-8f5a-4cb8-9d0d-c2f1bb036a5e[8] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-6-2021-kb5004951-security-only-update-out-of-band-e05a81cd-9b45-4622-b715-ddb2367bca47[9] https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383432\n2021 eSentire, Inc.

                    "value": "Microsoft began rolling out a mandatory security patch for most supported Windows versions yesterday to fix the PrintNightmare vulnerability \u2013 a critical issue present in the Windows Print Spooler service tracked under CVE-2021-34527 that when exploited could allow for both remote code execution (RCE) and local privilege escalation (LPE). While yesterday\u2019s update fixed the RCE exploit, the changelog did not mention any fixes for the LPE component.\nNow, security researchers have begun reporting that the patch released yesterday can be bypassed, as it does not fix the problem with the Point and Print policy in Windows \u2013 which the firm initially said was not directly related \u2013, which can still be used to perform RCE and LPE. Researchers and experts tweeted proof of concepts (spotted by BleepingComputer) running on fully patched systems, showing off how the patch could be completely bypassed to perform LPE. This was corroborated by another researcher from CERT, Will Dormann.\nConsidering that the zero-day vulnerability and its possible exploits have been widely shared in the wild, systems that have the Print Spooler service running might be at active risk of being compromised, especially those in enterprise setups that use the functions to remotely install printer drivers and updates. For now, though, the original workarounds of disabling the Print Spooler service or blocking inbound remote printing through Group Policy might be the best option to mitigate potential threats. While the changes do impact printing functionality, it is a faster fix and negates the need for admins to provision ineffective patches for their organization\u2019s systems.\nCurrently, there is no word from Microsoft about the researchers\u2019 findings, but it will not be surprising to know that the firm is already working on a patch for addressing the issues. It might help to also keep an eye out for updates on the MSRC page tracking the vulnerability.\nUpdate: Microsoft has updated the MSRC listing noting that it is rolling out patches for Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, and Windows 10, Version 1607. The firm adds that in order to secure the system, users \"must confirm that the following registry settings are set to 0 or are not defined\".\nInterestingly, CERT researcher Dormann claims that the \"NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall = 0 does NOT prevent exploitation\". The firm is yet to address the reports from other security research firms as well.\nPlease enter your reason for reporting this comment.\nThe following codes can be used in comments."

Like any IT endpoint, a compromised printer can open up whole areas of issues for the overall corporate network.\u00a0 Not only can documents that have been stored or printed be compromised, without the correct security controls, networked printers and MFPs can be a major ingress point to access the corporate network.\nThe proliferation of home printers and the shift to a more distributed print infrastructure, away from centralised printing in the post-pandemic office means there is a heightened need to secure the print environment to prevent data and overall security breaches.\nThis has come to the fore recently with the Microsoft Windows Print Spooler Vulnerability (PrintNightmare) where Microsoft issued a critical vulnerability warning and patch due to the accidental publishing of a proof of concept (PoC) compromise of its print spooler[3].\nQuocirca\u2019s Print Security Study\u00a0revealed that just 21% of IT Decision Makers are very confident in the security of their print infrastructure. pointing to the need for solutions and services that can help organisations mitigate these risks and improve print security confidence. To effectively combat advanced security threats, organisations need to combine network security with data and endpoint security for the print environment \u2013 which is key to a zero-trust architecture.\nMPS providers must build expertise to address the zero-trust requirements of their customers. This means offering and implementing a multi-layered security proposition to protect printing across the hybrid work environment.\nThe world has changed, and old security approaches are no longer fit for purpose.\u00a0 Cloud-based MPS providers are ideally situated to take a strong position in providing new approaches to deal with environments where the platform is less physically definable and where devices and users are distributed across managed and less-managed environments.\u00a0 By creating a set of solid messages around zero-trust security with meaningful benefits to prospects and customers, MPS providers can successfully monetise future opportunities in the security market.\n[1]\u00a0https://www.zdnet.com/article/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain-attack-everything-you-need-to-know-updated/\n[2]\u00a0https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/10/colonial_pipeline_ransomware/\n[3]\u00a0https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565868/microsoft-printnightmare-windows-print-spooler-service-emergency-patch-hotfix\nThe Theatre of Dreams briefly turned into The Theatre of Nightmares as Manchester United Football Club suffered a cyber-attack on their systems on Friday 20th November.

                    "value": "A potentially new zero-day Microsoft vulnerability, dubbed \"PrintNightmare,\" makes it possible for any authenticated attacker to remotely execute code with SYSTEM privileges on any machine that has the Windows Print Spooler service enabled (which is the default setting). Security researchers initially believed this vulnerability to be tied to CVE-2021-1675 (Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability), which was first disclosed in the June 8, 2021, Microsoft Patch Tuesday release. But there is now some question about whether this is the same issue or a new zero-day vulnerability.\nLast week, researchers at Chinese security firm QiAnXin technology published a video of a working proof-of-concept exploit of CVE-2021-1675 that highlighted how the vulnerability could be exploited both locally and remotely. After their proof-of-concept was disclosed, QiAnXin noticed, on June 21st, that Microsoft had changed the title of the vulnerability, which was initially identified as only being exploitable locally, to reflect this remote code execution aspect. They also changed the vulnerability status from its original designation (high severity, privilege escalation) to critical severity, remote code execution. Adding to the confusion, Microsoft's current (as of this post) write-up for CVE-2021-1675 still states that it is a local vulnerability.\nCompounding the risk to organizations further, threat researchers at Sangfor Security, working independently and in parallel with QiAnXin, had developed their own working proof-of-concept code, which they posted to Github this past Tuesday (June 29th). While this detailed proof-of-concept has since been taken down, multiple cached copies still exist.\u00a0It can be reasonably expected that bad actors will potentially leverage this information for future attacks.\nMicrosoft has not yet provided any official statement to confirm whether this is a variation of the CVE-2021-1675 vulnerability or a new vulnerability altogether. But\u00a0according to Bleeping Computer, PrintNightmare is not the same as CVE-2021-1675 but a new Windows Print Spooler zero-day vulnerability. This position is supported by reports from multiple threat researchers who have confirmed that they have achieved remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on a fully patched system. Security researchers will continue to investigate.\nBut regardless of the outcome of that investigation, neither a new nor an updated patch is currently available for this vulnerability. And proof-of-concept code now in the wild is able to exploit Windows Print Spoolers even after systems have been fully patched. As a result, administrators are strongly advised to stop and disable their spooler service, especially on domain controller systems.\nIt is unknown what versions of Windows are affected by this vulnerability. However, Benjamin Delpy's (creator of MimiKatz) research confirms that the latest Windows update of June 8, 2021-KB5003646 (OS Build 17763.1999) for Windows 10 is susceptible to this vulnerability.\nMS.Windows.Print.Spooler.AddPrinterDriver.Privilege.Escalation.\nNOTE:\u00a0The FortiGuard Labs IPS team was maintaining this signature under the CVE-2021-1675 designation. With the publication of the Microsoft advisory issued earlier (please see Update as of July 2nd\u00a0below), the FortiGuard Labs IPS team is now maintaining this signature under the new CVE-2021-34527 designation created by Microsoft.\nFortiEDR provides protection by blocking the load process of malicious DLLs that stem from the exploitation of the PrintNightmare vulnerability.

The security patch, released outside of its normal security patch release window, will come as great relief for the millions of businesses and organizations around the world attempting to mitigate this issue.\nMicrosoft's security patch comes not a moment too soon.\nThe PrintNightmare zero-day exploit (CVE-2021-34527) is a remote code execution vulnerability. This means that if an attacker were to exploit the vulnerability, they could theoretically execute malicious code on a target system.\nNow, Microsoft has released security patches to fix the issue, covering all active Windows 10 versions (and even some no longer active, such as Windows 10 version 1507) along with Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.\nThere are a few notable exceptions, however, such as Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2012, but Microsoft will undoubtedly release patches for these versions too.\nFor those running Windows 10, installing the PrintNightmare security patch is a simple process and works similarly to any other security patch.\nPrior to releasing the security patch, Microsoft released a series of PrintNightmare mitigations, primarily focused on disabling the affected Print Spooler service.\nThere are two ways organizations can disable the Print Spooler service: via PowerShell or through Group Policy.\nMicrosoft isn't the only organization advising users to switch print spooling services off where possible. CISA also released a statement advising a similar policy, encouraging \"administrators to disable the Windows Print spooler service in Domain Controllers and systems that do not print.\"\nThe zero-day exploit at the root of the issue almost never was. Instead, the PrintNightmare proof-of-concept was revealed accidentally then deleted almost instantaneously\u2014but not before it had been forked and copied into the wild.\nWe deleted the POC of PrintNightmare. To mitigate this vulnerability, please update Windows to the latest version, or disable the Spooler service. For more RCE and LPE in Spooler, stay tuned and wait our Blackhat talk. https://t.co/heHeiTCsbQ\nFor now, the mitigation remains the same until you can download and install Microsoft's official security patches.\nLearn about the common types of malware and their differences, so you can understand how viruses, trojans, and other malware work.\nGavin is the Junior Editor for Windows and Technology Explained, a regular contributor to the Really Useful Podcast, and a regular product reviewer.

This vulnerability allowed hackers to take remote control over PCs through the Print Spooler system\u2014pretty scary stuff! Unfortunately, researchers at Chinese tech company Sangfor have set a similar exploit called PrintNightmare on the loose after telling hackers how to take advantage of a previously undiscovered bug.\nHow did this happen? Well, Sangfor is preparing to hold a conference on Windows\u2019 printer system, which has always been vulnerable to hackers. To get people ready for this conference, Sangfor decided to publish a Proof of Concept (POC) explaining how the recently-patched CVE-2021-1675 works and all the dangerous things you can do with it.\nBut these researchers weren\u2019t playing with CVE-2021-1675. It turns out that they had discovered a similar vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler called PrintNightmare\u2014which now carries the flattering CVE-2021-34527 moniker. By publishing a POC on PrintNightmare, Sangfor effectively taught hackers how to take advantage of a dangerous, zero-day bug in the Windows system.\nMicrosoft has assigned CVE-2021-34527 to the remote code execution vulnerability that affects Windows Print Spooler. Get more info here: https://t.co/OarPvNCX7O\nPrintNightmare impacts all versions of Windows, according to Microsoft. It\u2019s a bug within the Windows Print Spooler\u2014a complicated tool that Windows uses to juggle printing schedules, among other things. Hackers who exploit this vulnerability gain full control over a system, with the power to run arbitrary code, install software, and manage files.\nIn a June 1st Microsoft Security Response Center post, the company states that hackers need to log into a PC before running the PrintNightmare exploit (meaning that businesses, libraries, and other organizations with large networks may be the most vulnerable). Microsoft says that hackers are actively exploiting PrintNightmare to compromise systems, so concerned parties should take steps to mitigate the problem.\nCurrently, though, the only way to defend a PC from PrintNightmare is to disable printing functions like the Print Spooler. This precaution may be impossible in organizations where printing networks are a necessity, but you can learn how to take these steps at the Microsoft Security Response Center.\nThe above article may contain affiliate links, which help support Review Geek.\nBy submitting your email, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

Jacob Zuma, South Africa\u2019s president at the time, was talking about the membership figures of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at a party convention in 2015 when he encountered a number that twisted his tongue.\n\u201cSeven-hundred and sixty-nine, eight-hundred and\u2026seven hundred\u2014listen properly\u2014 seven-hundred and sixty-nine thousand, eight-hundred and twenty and seventy members, down from one hundred point two million in 2012,\u201d Zuma said, struggling to read out 769,870 from a piece of paper in front of him at the lectern.\nCue laughter among those gathered in the hall, and online.\nNow six years later, that tongue-twister is providing fodder for jokes at a time when Zuma has no cause for laughter. This week, the man who ruled South Africa from 2009 to 2018 was sentenced to 15 months in prison by the nation\u2019s highest court for failing to cooperate with a corruption inquiry investigating allegations of graft during his tenure.\nNando\u2019s, the South African chain of restaurants best known for its peri-peri chicken and spicy commercials, took a jab at Zuma\u2019s misfortune in a tweet that is stirring up old feelings. \u201cA lockdown we can all get behind,\u201d the tweet read. In an attached photo, it continued: \u201cDo not pass Go. Do not collect. Seven-hundred and sixty-nine eight-hundred million. Delivery in 5 days.\u201d\nTo avoid all doubt about who the tweet was about, the restaurant added: #JacobZuma. The tweet packed a lot in a few words. The lockdown was in reference to newly-imposed restrictions imposed by current president Cyril Ramaphosa this week, to stem the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant that is currently ravaging the country amid a slow rollout of coronavirus vaccines. The five-day delivery timeline alludes to the number of days Zuma was given by the court to turn himself in before the police arrest him.\nPandemonium ensued on Twitter. Zuma, who still holds considerable political power, has a lot of fans. And many of them were not shy to tell the restaurant chain what they thought of their antics. One posted a video of themself throwing away a Nando\u2019s bag, saying the company had lost \u201cthis one custome.r\u201d \u201cThis is why I stopped going to Nando\u2019s, Nando\u2019s are politically affiliated. They mendle (sic) in political narratives,\u201d wrote another. One promised to \u201cdeal\u201d with Nando\u2019s at an unnamed time. On and on they went with vague threats of retribution and boycotts. Some saw the funny side: \u201cLet me go and order Nandos. I see Zuma fans are catching feelings,.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t Nando\u2019s first dalliance with controversy. It ran an advert titled \u201cLast Dictator Standing\u201d not long after Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi was killed in 2011. That was followed in 2017 by a campaign titled \u201cWe can fix our s#*t\u201d, a commentary about the state of corruption in South Africa. Zuma was president when that advert ran.\nDoug Place, the chain\u2019s chief marketing officer in South Africa, explained in 2018 why the company often wades into the issue of the day in its advertising. \u201cWe take pride in joining conversations and sparking debate around all relevant topics that are in the public interest. Often this discourse involves leaders, individuals and organizations that threaten the hard-won freedoms we enjoy as a country today and are therefore not free from public scrutiny,\u201d Place said.\nControversial ads by chicken companies are also not uncommon in South Africa. In 2018, the Advertising Regulatory Board of South Africa, an industry regulator, banned a commercial by fast-food company Chicken Licken depicting a Black man discovering a foreign land in the 17th century and naming it \u201cEurope.\u201d It was a riff on colonialism, but the regulator deemed that it \u201ctrivializes an issue that is\u2026upsetting for many South African people.\u201d\nControversial tweets from a chicken company notwithstanding, Zuma\u2019s sentencing is a seismic moment in South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid history. There is a feeling in the country that there are no repercussions for politicians who dip their hands into the till. Zuma\u2019s sentencing is a warning that no one is above the law. The chickens have come home to roost for the former president.\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech, and innovation in your inbox.\n\ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).\nBy providing your email, you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy.\n\u00a9 2021 Quartz Media, Inc.

Enjoy!\nOur emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend.\nWith the internet shut down and under the cover of darkness, government forces went after protestors in Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy of Eswatini. All this while Eswatini\u2019s dominant neighbor, South Africa, remained silent in the midst of former president Zuma\u2019s court sentencing trials.\nThe shutdown of the internet in Eswatini was confirmed in the past week by telecom operators there, with MTN stating that its subsidiary together with other telcos in the country \u201creceived a directive from the Eswatini Communications Commission to suspend access to social media and online platforms\u201d until further notice. This move was immediately criticized by pressure and lobbying groups advocating for free access to the internet and other online platforms.\nBusiness operations for local and international companies in the country \u201cwere disrupted by protests in Eswatini\u2019s largest cities and industrial areas\u201d in addition to \u201ctargeted attacks of businesses with supposed links to the monarchy,\u201d said Aleix Montana, Africa analyst at risk advisory firm\u2014Verisk Maplecroft\u2014in a statement to Quartz. He added that this will likely further impact risk perception of the country. The country ranks very poorly in global ratings on political rights and civil liberties, with Freedom House considering it, \u201cnot free.\u201d\n\u201cShutting down the internet is a bad decision,\u201d said Felicia Anthonio, a campaigner with the lobby group, Access Now in a statement to Quartz. \u201cBut time and time again, these bad decisions get made. Authorities in Eswatini claim they want peace, but are in fact flaming tensions. Shutting down the internet is absurd.\u201d\nKing Mswati III, in power since 1986, has been under pressure to quit from pro-democracy protestors who took to the streets starting May after the\u00a0 death of a law student reportedly at the hands of police. Protests have intensified over the past weeks.\nEswatini is now among a list of African countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, Uganda, Niger, and the DRC that have shut down the internet or disabled online platforms in 2021 during protests and elections. As a result of the latest internet shutdown, Eswatini has been shut out from the rest of the world and there has been sluggish information flow from the country. Eswatini government\u2019s decision to shut down the internet has already been challenged in court. Internet shutdowns come at a great economic cost to African countries.\nWith the protests continuing during an internet blackout and a crackdown on journalists inside the country, Johannesburg based head of operational risk for Fitch Solutions, Chiedza Madzima says she believes that the current outbreak of protests in the country reflects a generational conflict.\nThis is in part \u201ca generational conflict where the youth\u2014weighed down by youth unemployment rates of near 50% in 2019 (and) likely worse with Covid-19 impact\u2014have long-waited for economic opportunities, that have been further thinned out\u201d by the impact of Covid-19, she told Quartz.\nShe added \u201cThe call now, from the youth, is for political representation in an effort to change a system that they feel benefits the few elite classes in the country. These protests are a de facto vote of no confidence in the government.\u201d\nThe ruling ANC party in neighboring South Africa is facing its own troubles as its own leaders battle an emerging revolt over the graft court case of former president Jacob Zuma. This emerging crisis in South Africa has dampened expectations of them intervening in Eswatini\u2019s crisis despite the deaths of scores of protestors.\nIn a statement to Quartz, Neil Thompson, Africa research analyst at the Economic Intelligence Unit, said \u201cthe South African government (will likely) do its best to ignore the situation in Eswatini.\u201d\nSign up to\u00a0the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here\u00a0for news and analysis on African business, tech, and innovation in your inbox.\n\ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).\nBy providing your email, you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy.\n\u00a9 2021 Quartz Media, Inc.

He has testified only once at the inquiry into what has become known as \"state capture\" - meaning the siphoning off of state assets.\nBusinessmen have been accused of conspiring with politicians to influence the decision-making process while he was in office. But Zuma has repeatedly said that he is the victim of a political conspiracy.\nIn a separate legal matter, Zuma pleaded not guilty last month in a corruption trial involving a $5bn (\u00a33bn) arms deal from the 1990s.\nThough he was forced out of office by his own party in 2018, the African National Congress (ANC), he retains a loyal body of supporters, especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\nOn Sunday, crowds formed what they called a human shield outside Zuma's palatial home in an effort to prevent his arrest. Similar crowds gathered before he handed himself in on Wednesday.\nZuma was once an illustrious political figure, who was jailed for fighting the racist system of apartheid in South Africa.\nNow, he has been arrested for being contemptuous of South Africa's most senior judges - the guardians of the democracy he fought for - as he tried to evade accountability over the deluge of corruption allegations he faced during his presidency.\nIt is an ignominious end to Zuma's political career, but a proud moment for South Africa's democracy. It shows that no-one is above the law - not even a former president.\nHis supporters threatened to block any attempt by police to arrest him, but in the end they did not have to. The 79-year-old surrendered, knowing he could not defeat the might of the state.\nThe BBC's Nomsa Maseko, who was outside Zuma's home on Wednesday, noted that there was a large police presence outside the property that included armed officers and a paramilitary unit.\nA delegation of senior officers are believed to have spent several hours inside the residence negotiating with the former president over his arrest.\nA convoy of cars, one of which was carrying Zuma, was then seen leaving the house at high-speed shortly before the midnight deadline for his detention.\nZuma previously declared that he was prepared to go to prison.\nHowever, he said that \"sending me to jail during the height of a pandemic, at my age, is the same as sentencing me to death\".\nNKANDLA, South Africa (Reuters) -South African former President Jacob Zuma turned himself in to police on Wednesday to begin 15 months in jail for contempt of court, the culmination of a long legal drama seen as a test of the post-apartheid state's ability to enforce the rule of law.  Police spokesperson Lirandzu Themba confirmed in a statement that Zuma was in police custody, in compliance with the Constitutional Court judgment.  The Department of Correctional Services said in a separate statement that Zuma was admitted to Estcourt Correctional Centre, about 175 km (108 miles) from his rural homestead in Nkandla in eastern South Africa.\nFormer South African president Jacob Zuma turned himself in to police for contempt of court, a spokesperson confirmed Wednesday, ending a weeklong legal drama over a court order for his arrest.Police had been ordered to arrest Zuma if he did not turn himself in by the end of Wednesday.He had refused to do so earlier this week - striking a defiant tone by launching legal challenges against his arrest.The Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months in jail last week after he refused to comply with a corruption inquiry back in February.Zuma denied widespread corruption under his presidency, and hundreds of his supporters, some of them armed, gathered nearby his rural estate to try and prevent his arrest.But in the end, Zuma decided to go quietly, a remarkable turn of events for a revered veteran of the African National Congress liberation movement.Zuma had previously been jailed by South Africa's white minority rulers for his part in the anti-apartheid movement.The Zondo Commission, an investigation into Zuma launched in 2018, is examining allegations that he allowed businessmen to plunder state resources and traffic influence over government policy.Both Zuma and the businessmen deny any wrongdoing.Zuma also faces a separate court case relating to a $2 billion arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president, charges which he denies.The former president maintains that he is the victim of a political witch hunt and that Zondo is biased against him.\nGet top results for everything you need, quickly!

Zuma turned himself in to police overnight to begin his jail term for defying a court order to give evidence at an inquiry into corruption while he was in power from 2009 to 2018.  The ability of authorities to bring Zuma to book has been seen as a major test of the rule of law in post-Apartheid South Africa, and experts said the former president's legal options for avoiding jail were fast running out.\nThis top-rated inflatable pool is big enough for the family\u2014 and it can be yours for less than $40 right now.\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s decision to withdraw a residual U.S. force could look like an amateurish, unforced error if an expected Taliban resurgence materializes.\nThe suspect planted two pipe bombs near the RNC and DNC headquarters the night before a mob of pro-Trump supporters descended upon the US Capitol.\nWhen Hungary passed legislation last month curbing children's access to discussion of homosexuality, transgender chemistry teacher Floris Fellegi-Balta was not sure he would be able to continue teaching at all.

He has maintained he is the victim of a political witch hunt and that Zondo is biased against him.\nZuma gave in to pressure to quit and yield to his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, in 2018, and since then has faced several attempts to bring him to book for alleged corruption during and before his time as president.\nThe Zondo Commission is examining allegations that he allowed three Indian-born businessmen, the brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, to plunder state resources and influence policy. He and the brothers, who fled to Dubai after Zuma\u2019s ouster, deny wrongdoing.\nZuma also faces a separate court case relating to a $2 billion arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president.\nS.

Photo: Rogan Ward/Reuters\nFormer South African president Jacob Zuma tried to block his arrest in court yesterday as top police officials said they would hold back while his two-pronged legal challenge unfolds.\nThe constitutional court sentenced Mr Zuma a week ago to a 15-month jail term for contempt of court after he defied an order to give evidence at an inquiry into corruption during his nine years in power.\nBut Mr Zuma did not hand himself in, instead asking the constitutional court to cancel its sentence and approaching the high court to issue an order \u2013 known as an interdict \u2013 to prevent his arrest.\nThe judge presiding over the case said he would rule on Friday at 11.30am on whether to grant the interdict.\nSpeaking to journalists on Sunday, Mr Zuma lashed out at the judges who\u00a0sentenced him and compared them to the white minority rulers he fought during the liberation struggle. Hundreds of his supporters, some of them armed, were gathered nearby at his rural homestead to prevent his arrest.\nMr Zuma\u2019s latest act of defiance is seen as a test of South Africa\u2019s rule of law.\nIt has the potential to erupt into violence as the former president still commands a loyal following\u00a0in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal and within the governing African National Congress (ANC).\nYesterday, Mr Zuma\u2019s lawyer Dali Mpofu urged the Pietermaritzburg High Court to grant the interdict, given the \u201caggravated situation\u201d in the country since Mr Zuma was sentenced and other factors \u2013\u00a0including his age.\n\u201cWhat we have here, my lord, is a warrant of arrest for the former head of state who will be 80 years next birthday, who is not a flight risk on anybody\u2019s version,\u201d he said.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionn\u00e1n Sheahan's exclusive take on the day's news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.\nOutside the courthouse 20 to 30 Zuma supporters protested, waving banners and wore T-shirts reading \u201cThe people\u2019s president deserves a fair trial\u201d and \u201cHands off Zuma\u201d.\nA lawyer for the corruption inquiry, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, said Mr Zuma had a duty to hand himself in by Sunday, irrespective of his application for the constitutional court to cancel its sentence, which will be heard on Monday.\n\u201cMr Zuma on his own has literally taken the law into his own hands,\u201d Mr Ngcukaitobi said. \u201cWe are dealing with a recalcitrant, deliberately defiant litigant.\u201d\nThe inquiry that Mr Zuma refused to attend is examining allegations he allowed three Indian-born businessmen, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, to plunder state resources and traffic influence over government policy.\nMr Zuma and the Gupta brothers, who fled the country after Mr Zuma was ousted by allies of his successor Cyril Ramaphosa, deny any wrongdoing.\nIn a letter to the acting chief justice, seen by Reuters, the state attorney acting for the police minister and police commissioner said they would hold back from arresting Mr Zuma pending the outcome of his litigation or directions to act otherwise.\nSenior ANC official Jessie Duarte said the party was aware Mr Zuma was exploring \u201cevery legal avenue\u201d to reduce or escape his prison sentence.\n\u201cWe believe the judiciary must be left to make its own decisions, (but) we would hope comrade Zuma\u2019s court application will be successful,\u201d she said."

When you are ordered to appear at court and you refuse, that clearly means you don't care and you don't follow the law, the very same law that you fought for Mr Zuma. Your ignorance made you to be sentenced to jail, so this time, do the right thing.\" - Pholoso Thulo in Mogale City, Gauteng\u00a0\"A very historic day in our beautiful country's legal history. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, like the ConCourt is our uppermost court. To disobey an order from any court, without a good reason accepted in law, should result in a finding of contempt as it is criminal conduct in South African law. No one is above the law. Hats off to the ConCourt justices who delivered an unwavering judgement, displaying brilliance. A judgment without fear, favour or prejudice. A clear precedent has been set. Emotions aside, let's pray that the former president hands himself over without a need for the minister of police having to enforce the sanction handed down.

REUTERS/Rogan Ward\nNKANDLA, South Africa (Reuters) -A South African court on Saturday agreed to hear ex-president Jacob Zuma's challenge to a 15-month jail term for failing to attend a corruption hearing, as hundreds of his supporters gathered outside his home in a show of force.\nThe constitutional court had on Tuesday given Zuma 15 months in jail for absconding in February from the inquiry led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Zuma had until the end of Sunday to hand himself in, but on Saturday the court agreed to hear his application, suspending the order.\nThe South African Broadcasting Corporation (\u200bSABC) reported that the court will hear his application on July 12.\nThe jail sentence was seen as sign of just how far Zuma, once revered as a veteran of the struggle against white minority rule, has fallen since embarking on a presidency beset by multiple sleaze and graft scandals between 2009 and 2018.\nHis travails have divided the ruling African National Congress, which cancelled an executive committee meeting over the weekend in order to focus on the ensuing crisis.\nThe ex-leader has applied to the court for the sentence to be annulled on the grounds that it is excessive and could expose him to COVID-19.\n\"When somebody is saying please hear me out ... and then we have court that says 'OK, we are willing to listen to you', that\u2019s the kind of justice system people died for in this country,\" the Jacob Zuma Foundation said in a statement.\nAt his hometown of Nkandla, Zuma, who did not speak to his supporters, wore a black and gold tropical shirt as he walked through the crowd, but no mask. He was guarded by men dressed as traditional warriors from his Zulu nation, wearing leopard skins and holding spears with oval ox-hide shields.\n\"They can give Zuma 15 months ... or 100 months. He's not going to serve even one day or one minute of that,\" his son Edward Zuma told Reuters at the gathering. \"They would have to kill me before they put their hands on him.\"\nIn an application to annul the decision submitted on Friday, Zuma said going to jail \"would put him at the highest risk of death\" from the pandemic because he was nearly 80 and has a medical condition.\nZuma also called the sentence a \"political statement of exemplary punishment\". He has maintained he is the victim of a political witch hunt and that Zondo is biased against him.\nZuma gave in to pressure to quit and yield to his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, in 2018, and since then has faced several attempts to bring him to book for alleged corruption during and before his time as president.\nThe Zondo Commission is examining allegations that he allowed three Indian-born businessmen, the brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, to plunder state resources and influence policy. He and the brothers, who fled to Dubai after Zuma's ouster, deny wrongdoing.\nZuma also faces a separate court case relating to a $2 billion arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president.\nReport it to us.\nBest viewed on Chrome browsers.\nWe would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.

He is 13 years old, sitting cross-legged in the red dust and white sand outside a diamond mining town on Southern Africa's Atlantic coast.\nIn his lap he holds a pigeon. The bird's name is Bartholomew, and he coos as the child strokes it with his one good hand.\nMsizi works in the De Beers diamond mines \u2014 and he uses his bird to smuggle out illicit gemstones.\nThe child coughs up blood. Diamond dust is embedded in the pink muscle tissue of his lungs. For the rest of his life, short or not, he will have difficulty breathing.\nIt's Sunday. We are on a beach close to the Namibia-South Africa border, on the outskirts of a restricted mining town called Oranjemund.\nFor the better part of 80 years, this part of the West Coast was owned by the De Beers conglomerate and officially closed off to the public.\nDuring its heyday, everyone in Die Sperrgebiet (the Forbidden Zone) laboured for De Beers and no one was allowed to leave.\nOne recent survey found that 46 per cent of diamond miners were between the ages of five and 16, writes MATTHEW GAVIN FRANK. Pictured:\u00a0An 11-year-old boy working at a diamond mine in the Carnot region of the Central African Republic, in May 2015\nDe Beers kept the residents distracted with trucked-in luxuries. Fully furnished and well-stocked houses were provided.\nThe company set up a school system for the children, and provided recreational clubs.\nDe Beers even had a shadowy agreement with satellite companies to redact images of the Forbidden Zone from their files.\nBeginning in 2007, De Beers deemed portions of this land to be 'over-mined,' and the doors to some of these towns slowly began opening to the public for the first time.\nThough the company still controls much of the area, and though signs threatening trespassers with imprisonment and/or death still proliferate by the roadside, restricted entry is now possible.\nMsizi is talking to me because his mother urged him to. She wants the family's story to be told, but she is afraid: smuggling is rife and the penalties are brutal.\nPeople sometimes just disappear, even children. If a miner dies at work, the body might be buried underground, to prevent other miners from using the corpse to smuggle out stolen stones.\nSimply talking to me could be dangerous, so I assure Msizi and his mother that I will change the names of everyone I interview.\nThe boy scratches at scars under his armpits. These are rope burns, from the lines tied under his arms before he is lowered into the pit each day by older, bulkier miners.\nAt the bottom of the shaft, he spends each day digging and filling burlap sacks with dirt that is then sifted for diamonds at the surface.\n'Some days are good,' he says, 'and some days are bad. Some days, no stones. That's when they think I'm hiding something.\n'I only use Bartholomew if I find a good amount, early in the day. I have to wait for when no one is looking at me.'\nHe smiles, and raises Bartholomew as if assessing his weight. 'We are good at being invisible.'\nSome miners hide pigeons in their clothes. Msizi has a craftier method. Each day, he takes his metal lunchbox into the mine.\nUsually it contains half a peach chutney sandwich and a bag of Simba tomato sauce-flavoured crisps. But if he only takes the crisps, there is just enough room for his pigeon.\nThough mineworkers have to pass through an X-ray machine upon entering and leaving the mine, South Africa has made it illegal for mining companies to over-radiate their workers.\nThe machines light up and whirr in the same way, whether or not they're conducting an X-ray.\nTo reduce the chances of being discovered, Msizi doesn't risk bringing in his pigeon if another smuggler has been caught within the past few days.\nThe security guards will be more alert than usual and, if they find Bartholomew, they will kill him \u2014 either by wringing his neck, running him through with a ballpoint pen or biting his head off.\nSometimes, there will be other punishments. Miners' fingers will be broken or even cut off.\nThe little finger on Msizi's left hand was snapped by a guard simply because he was suspected of smuggling.\nOnce through the X-ray machine and in the mine, the boy will transfer the bird to the loose folds of his overalls.\nWhile he works through the sludge, he secretes diamonds under his tongue. At a quiet moment, he looks around.\nIf a miner dies at work, the body might be buried underground, to prevent other miners from using the corpse to smuggle out stolen stones. Pictured: An open-cast diamond mine in southern Africa\nThe other diggers keep their heads down, their backs bent. If they know what he plans to do, they are pretending not to notice.\nMsizi packs the diamonds into four bags he has fashioned from sacking, and binds one to each of the bird's feet and one beneath each wing, with ligatures sewn of gemsbok hide.\nThen he carries Bartholomew to the bottom of a shaft and lets him go. He does not wait to see him fly up into the light \u2014 if a guard spots the bird, Msizi does not want his own face seen.\nThe pigeon flies back to Msizi's family shack, where his mother is waiting. She retrieves the diamonds.\nLater, they will be traded to buyers from organised crime gangs. Msizi says she is paid the equivalent of about 15p per carat.\nA stone that might fetch \u00a350,000 in a jeweller's shop in London will fetch perhaps 50p in the shanty town outside Oranjemund.\nOther smugglers want drugs, especially 'tik' or crystal meth.\nDe Beers officials know the miners use homing pigeons. One cynical security guard told me he could recognise a smuggler on sight, because that meant everybody: all the miners were potential thieves, he said.\nBy that logic, every pigeon was being used to ferry stolen diamonds.\nThe mining companies put pressure on local governments, which passed laws declaring it illegal to raise pigeons. In one district, it is illegal not to shoot a pigeon on sight.\nBecause so many birds are killed, either in flight or when they are spotted by the X-ray machines, the temptation for miners is to overload them with diamonds.\nThat creates another hazard \u2014 weighed down, with bags under their wings that make it impossible for them to fully flap, the exhausted birds falter and land along the beaches of the Diamond Coast.\nWhen this happens, a frenzy of diamond-hunting erupts along the sands. People yell, fight and tear the diamonds from the pigeons' feet.\nRumours spread, and at least one of the mine workers \u2014 maybe the culprit, maybe someone mistaken for the culprit \u2014 will have his little finger broken. And the punishments can be far worse: eyes gouged out, or hands, ears, feet or head cut off.\nWhen I ask Msizi about these punishments, and by whom they are administered, he goes quiet.\nThough we are alone, he checks the beach for eavesdroppers.\nHe tells me that he is prohibited from talking about it \u2014 that if the mine security guards find out he has spoken to an outsider like me, they may call in the services of someone called Mr Lester.\nHis voice grows shaky. He says Mr Lester is ten metres tall, breathes fire, has sharp teeth, no eyes, the wings of a raptor and the ability to infiltrate one's dreams.\nNaturally, I dismiss this part of the story. It is just a nightmare, spread to scare the children.\nAnd a great number of miners are children: according to a 2016 report by the U.S.'s Bureau of International Labour Affairs: 'Children in South Africa [continue to] engage in the worst forms of child labour.'\nOne recent survey found that 46 per cent of diamond miners were between the ages of five and 16.\nBut it is not only the children who are terrified of Mr Lester, I discover. In Alexander Bay, just south of the Namibia-South Africa border, I speak to a police inspector who asks not to be named.\nHe tells me that no one has ever seen the real Mr Lester. He is believed to have more body doubles than the former South African president Jacob Zuma. 'He's invisible. He's like a spirit.'\nDepending on who I ask, Mr Lester is human or giant or spirit or half-man-half-animal.\nHe can read your thoughts and detect fluctuations in your body temperature to determine whether you're lying. Even De Beers executives are afraid of him.\nOf course, I want to see him. But finding him won't be easy. My first contact is with a former security guard from the Kleinzee mine, Nico Green.\nHe arrives for our meeting in a bar, 40 minutes late, and orders brandy and Coke. He's about 6 ft 6 in in a rugby shirt and little navy shorts, with a flat-top haircut and large round glasses.\nWith very little prompting, he begins to detail the corruption that swirls around the diamond industry. In one town, Port Nolloth, every public official was arrested for smuggling.\n'Until they're caught,' he says, 'they live in the lap of luxury. Big pink gangster houses.\n'We once found all these diamonds mixed with stolen ammunition in shoeboxes under the mayor's bed. He had this big syndicate going \u2014 33 people from Port Nolloth alone.'\nPigeons were commonly used to transport gems out of the mines. 'When I was working for De Beers, if I see a pigeon, it's my sworn duty to execute it.\n'If I don't, I'm encouraging bad behaviour.'\n'Still, smugglers find a way,' Nico continues. Sometimes that means concealing a tobacco bag filled with diamonds and greased with beeswax in their backsides.\nSometimes, it's worse \u2014 slitting open their forearms and stuffing the diamonds inside the wound.\nDue to fear of HIV and Aids, the security guards would often rush a bleeding worker to the hospital unsearched, whereupon a doctor or nurse, who was in on the scam, would either retrieve the stones from the gash, or sew them into the arm to be removed later.\nTalk to the people along this coast, he says, and they will tell you that 'God put the diamonds in the ground, that there's no such thing as an illicit diamond.'\nHe adds: 'My wife works for De Beers, and I told her, if you step over the line, I will take you out. No, really.'\nNico says Mr Lester is the chief of all the 'executioners'. He points me to a lesser 'executioner', a De Beers security executive named Johann MacDonald.\nMacDonald doesn't mind that the miners call him an 'executioner'. His other nickname, he says, is the 'hangman' \u2014 'It's all in good fun,' he says.\nHe wants me to understand that the company cracks down on smugglers to prevent the exploitation of child miners.\nOne gang cut through the fences around an excavation site and dug channels into the pit, going down many metres.\nSome miners hide pigeons in their clothes. Msizi has a craftier method. Each day, he takes his metal lunchbox into the mine\nThe pit is similar to an upside-down pyramid, wide at the top but narrow at the deepest point \u2014 so narrow that only children can fit in the tunnels.\n'It is a hell you can't imagine,' he says. The children dig in a circuit, fighting for breath as they scoop up the mud and hand it back.\nWhen they can't go on any longer, they circle back and gulp for air, then go back down.\nThe conditions are so bad that most of them are given 'tik', says MacDonald.\n'With the underground mines, it's worse,' he says. Smugglers are lowered by rope over a mile into the earth, where they live in darkness for years.\n'Supplies are lowered in the dead of night by co-conspirators, and when they are finally brought up to the surface, they have to be blindfolded to protect their eyes.\nMacDonald tells me Mr Lester is no phantom: 'He's real, flesh and blood.'\nMr Lester stays at a guesthouse in the desert, he says.\n'He's a chameleon. I'm not even 100 per cent on whether he's really South African or not.\n'Some people think he's KGB or CIA, or without any real allegiance. A mercenary, or king of the mercenaries.\n'But I just know him as the former director of all security, everywhere, for De Beers. The only guy they trust to do certain, specialised things.'\nBut after meeting Mr Lester, I can confirm he is real. I receive instructions from the farm's landlady to wait for him in the bar at midnight.\nHe arrives at one minute past \u2014 a frumpish man in a white button-down shirt with heavy jowls.\nHis name, in fact, is Lester Le Roux, former director of De Beers mine security. He says he hears I've been asking about pigeons.\n'A diamond can't steal itself,' he says heavily. 'And a diamond is like a beautiful woman \u2014 people lose control of their cerebellum, their minds.\n'But for the miners, there are definite on-site consequences if they are caught with a diamond on their persons.'\nI think of Msizi's lame finger. And I remember too that in 1991, one miner caught trying to smuggle a stolen stone was shot in the head.\n'One woman was caught hiding diamonds in the socket behind her glass eye,' says Mr Lester.\n'Boot heels! They hollow them out . . . But we've taken new measures. We tilt the floor of the X-ray rooms with wedges, so these things show up more easily in shoes.'\nFor a while, he explains, people would try to throw diamonds over the perimeter fence.\n'Then we put in a second fence, made the distance between them greater, but they got really clever with bows and arrows.\n'We added even more fences. Something had to get over these fences, and it was a pigeon.'\nMr Lester wants me to know that, despite his reputation, he is not a monster.\n'In spite of all these ruthless things you hear about De Beers, I actually do care, and have a high regard for human rights.\n'I'm heading up a division on voluntary principles of security in regard to human rights, and I'm even questioning our search procedures, because you can't search for a diamond by holding your hands inches away from the body.\n'You need to touch the body. Human rights make it very difficult for security and easy for the criminals.'\nHe makes eye contact with me, then looks at his thumbnails. 'I don't want to do this with the rest of my life,' he says. 'It's been 14 years of hell.\n'I don't want people to think of me like this. There were ten people killed in one mine collapse in 2012 \u2014 some of them were underage, but at least one man was over 60.'\nAfter I leave the guesthouse, I return to Alexander Bay, to see Msizi one last time.\nWe meet in a little park, opposite a cafe with no name. I buy him a sandwich, which he is too shy to eat in front of me. I ask him about his pigeon.\nMsizi looks nonplussed. 'He's somewhere in the desert,' says the boy.

For these reasons, the Government bears significant responsibility for the Plaintiffs\u2019 harm,\u201d the judge said.\nKelley, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly after the attack, had been convicted of domestic assault against his then-wife and stepson in 2012, making him legally unable to purchase a firearm under federal law.\nAfter his conviction by a general court-martial, he was released from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge in 2014. He then purchased four guns, three of which he brought to the First Baptist Church on Nov. 5, 2017.\nThe Air Force later admitted that it did not submit his criminal history information to the FBI database, which is used to determine whether someone can legally buy a firearm.\n\u201cThe Court concludes that the Government failed to exercise reasonable care in its undertaking to submit criminal history to the FBI,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in his decision.\nThe judge further noted that the Air Force had extensive knowledge of Kelley\u2019s violent tendencies and that it had \u201cexplicitly recognized his threats of mass violence.\u201d In addition to extending his pre-trial confinement because of his history of domestic violence and threats to obtain weapons, he was banned from the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, where he had been serving.\n\u201cThe Air Force conducted extensive mental health testing on Kelley, which revealed a significantly compromised individual,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cOne of the mental health tests found in the Air Force file showed that Kelley was in \u2018maximum risk range\u2019 for lack of control, violence, and stress coping. And the Air Force\u2019s High Risk for Violence Response Team concluded that Kelley should be considered high risks for suicidal and homicidal ideation.\u201d\nWith this information, \u201cno other individual \u2014 not even Kelley\u2019s own parents or partners \u2014 knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,\u201d Rodriguez wrote.\nRodriguez, with his ruling, ordered that a trial plan be set within 15 days to assess monetary damages."

Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant.\nThe attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history.\n\u201cThe trial conclusively established that no other individual \u2014 not even Kelley\u2019s own parents or partners \u2014 knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,\u201d Rodriguez wrote.\nKelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child\u2019s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers, and also from possessing body armor.\nRodriguez said that had the government done its job and entered Kelley\u2019s history into the database, \u201cit is more likely than not that Kelley would have been deterred from carrying out the Church shooting.\u201d\nAn Air Force spokeswoman did not immediately return a request seeking comment.\nAuthorities said Kelley fired at least 450 rounds at helpless worshippers who tried taking cover in the pews. As he left the small wood-frame church, Kelley was confronted by an armed resident who had grabbed his own rifle and exchanged fire with him. Kelley fled as two Sutherland Springs residents gave chase, and died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after losing control of his vehicle and crashing.\nLast month, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that survivors and relatives can\u2019t sue a sporting goods chain where Kelley purchased an AR-556 semi-automatic rifle used in shooting. Academy Sports and Outdoors had appealed after two lower courts declined to dismiss lawsuits.\nThe lawsuit against the federal government was brought by family members of the victims. Rodriguez ordered a later trial to assess damages owed to the families."

Key lawmakers say they expect to continue discussions this month in advance of a possible special session later in the year. \u201cI think the House and Senate are pretty close to an agreement,\u201d said Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House General Fund budget committee. \u201cThe vast majority of legislators want to move forward with a bond proposal and for us to own the prisons.\u201d Clouse and Sen. Greg Albritton, chairman of the Senate General Fund budget committee, said a topic under discussion is whether federal funds from the American Rescue Plan may be used to offset some of the costs or do renovations. States can use that money for a wide range of uses to contend with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Albritton said the state is trying to get clarity on \u201cwhat can we do with the recovery money.\u201d Lawmakers are looking for more options after Gov.

Firefighters were working to protect the resort, homes and recreational cabins in the area of interior Alaska about 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks. Flames were about 100 yards from the resort, where crews were spraying water on buildings, the agency said in a statement. Firefighters also conducted a back burn near a trail that leads to two yurts for viewing the northern lights in hopes it would help stop the fire from advancing toward the main buildings. Hoses and sprinklers also were set up at nearby homes and cabins. No structures in the Chena Hot Springs area had burned, fire officials said. Light showers that fell overnight weren\u2019t enough to put out the fire, but the increased humidity was helping to slow its growth. The Fairbanks North Star Borough on Monday issued a voluntary evacuation order. Alaska State Troopers conducted a survey of homeowners and cabin users and found that about 30 people decided not to leave, along with resort owner Bernie Karl.\nTucson: Officials in the city plan to ignore Arizona\u2019s new \u201cSecond Amendment sanctuary\u201d law that bars state and local governments from enforcing certain federal gun regulations, possibly setting up a court fight as a growing number of cities and counties in the United States declare themselves similar firearm havens. The move by Democratic Mayor Regina Romero and the City Council again puts Tucson and the Republican-led state at odds over how to regulate gun sales and use. The southern Arizona city has long tried to enforce gun laws stricter than the state\u2019s, including mandating background checks for guns purchased on city property and destroying seized firearms. Over the years, those measures have been challenged after the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted laws barring the actions. The new action came after GOP Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill in April declaring that Arizona is a so-called Second Amendment sanctuary. It was partly a response to the election of President Joe Biden, who has vowed to enact tighter firearms regulations. In a growing movement, at least 1,200 local governments have declared themselves sanctuaries insulated from state and federal gun laws since 2018, when high-profile mass shootings prompted calls for stronger regulations. Many are symbolic, but some carry legal force.\nBeebe: The Rev. Al Sharpton and attorneys for George Floyd\u2019s family on Tuesday mourned a white Arkansas teenager fatally shot by a sheriff\u2019s deputy, as they urged support across racial lines for efforts to reform police practices.

Michael Davis, during a traffic stop June 23 near Cabot, about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. The killing in the predominantly white community has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists such as Sharpton, who said concerns about police tactics aren\u2019t just limited to the Black community. \u201cThe issue of policing is not about Black and white,\u201d Sharpton told a packed auditorium at Beebe High School, where Brittain was a rising senior. \u201cIt\u2019s about right and wrong.\u201d Many attending the memorial wore jeans and shirts that read \u201cJustice for Hunter.\u201d Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week fired Davis for not turning on his body camera until after he had shot Brittain. Staley said the only footage police have is from the aftermath. Arkansas State Police are investigating Brittain\u2019s death. Authorities have released few details about the shooting. Brittain\u2019s family has said the teenager was unarmed and was holding a jug of antifreeze when he was shot.\nSacramento: State lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill\u2019s author said Tuesday. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January. The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. \u201cSafe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery,\u201d Wiener said. Currently the sites are illegal in the United States but legal in Canada. Wiener\u2019s bill barely cleared the Senate in April. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would \u201cestablish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens.\u201d The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it \u201cis very much alive, albeit delayed.\u201d Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths. His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.\nDenver: The Denver Zoo will begin vaccinating some of its animals against COVID-19 as early as next week. Zoologists say they have been working with the veterinary vaccine company Zoetis to receive doses for the animals, and primates and carnivores will be first on the list. The veterinary vaccine, which is formulated primarily for mammals, is being developed separate from the ones for human use. Transmission is rare between humans and other species, but there have been several documented cases of COVID-19 in large cats, monkeys and certain rodent populations. \u201cWe know some of those animals \u2013 like gorillas and tigers, mink, otters \u2013 can all be infected. But for a lot of these others, we don\u2019t know what the susceptibility is,\u201d Dr. Scott Larsen, the zoo\u2019s vice president of animal health, told KMGH-TV. \u201cFor animals, we want to be able to protect them similar to (how) we\u2019re trying to protect people.\u201d Veterinary scientists do not think common house pets like cats or dogs are in significant danger of catching COVID-19. \u201cThere are 85 million dogs in the United States and 90 million cats,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, a veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary in Denver. \u201cIf we were going to see problems &mldr I think we would be seeing it.\u201d\nGuilford: The state\u2019s newest climate change legislation should put it in a good position to receive millions of dollars in anticipated federal funds to help foot the bill for expensive resiliency projects needed across Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont and other state officials said Tuesday. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said the $30 million in bonding included in the new state budget to help municipalities identify and plan for such projects, including green infrastructure, will also give Connecticut a leg up on other states. \u201cWe\u2019ll be shovel-ready. We\u2019ll be at the front of the line,\u201d Dykes said during a bill-signing event at a beach in Guilford. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of dollars to help protect our communities from the impacts of climate change. And the best way to do that, dollars we really want to put to work, are federal dollars.\u201d Curt Johnson, president of the environmental group Save the Sound, predicted Connecticut will receive $3 or $4 in federal funds for every $1 the state spends on these resiliency efforts. The new law gives all cities and towns, not just certain ones, the ability to establish stormwater authorities. Additionally, the law expands the duties of the 10-year-old Connecticut Green Bank, a first-in-the-nation entity.\nDover: Two deadly species of hemlock have been found in Delaware, and the state\u2019s Department of Agriculture is warning people to avoid plants that look like wild carrots to prevent the possibility of being poisoned.

Both plants have small white flowers and bloom between June and August. Poison hemlock also grows in meadows, pastures and ditches. The invasive plant can reach between 6 and 8 feet tall and has a hairless stem with purple blotches. The department said this type of hemlock releases an odor but shouldn\u2019t be crushed to smell because toxic oils can be emitted. Spotted water hemlock is a native plant and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its stems vary in color from solid green or purple to green with purple spots or stripes, and it has fern-like leaves. People who think they found either plant can email pictures to DDA.Marketing@delaware.gov for identification. The Agriculture Department said residents shouldn\u2019t try to eradicate the hemlocks themselves and should instead find a licensed aquatic pest control company to treat them. It also advised against mowing the plants, which can release toxic particles into the air.\nWashington: Parking in the nation\u2019s capital is often a nightmare for residents and especially for their guests, but D.C. has launched an easier visitor parking pass program, WUSA-TV reports. When the visitor parking pass was launched in 2013, it was met with widespread opposition. With the new program, people can register for the annual pass allowing their guests to park for two hours in a residential permit parking zone in all eight wards. \u201cThe intent of the system is to make getting a visitor parking permit easier and also to reduce parking congestion in residential areas,\u201d said Everett Lott, acting director for the District Department of Transportation. The new online parking portal now allows people to print out their own parking permits for visitors and can be accessed through the portal provided by D.C. online or through an app on Apple or Android phones. \u201cThis particular system, the automated system, is connected to the resident and to the license plate,\u201d Lott said. \u201cSo it makes it a lot more user-friendly but also helps to eliminate any of the abuse that was possible in the past.\u201d Parking permits, which must be displayed prominently on the windshield of vehicles, can be printed at home, at D.C. Public Library branches, or at kiosks at DDOT Headquarters, the DDOT Permit Office and Metropolitan Police Department precincts.\nTampa: A couple is suing a Catholic school and demanding the return of a large donation, saying it isn\u2019t adhering to Catholic values because of the way it\u2019s handling issues like race and accepting the LGBTQ community. Anthony and Barbara Scarpo filed their lawsuit against the Academy of the Holy Names last month after one of their daughters graduated and a second transferred to another school, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The lawsuit comes four years after the couple pledged $1.35 million to the school, which named its theater for the family. The couple claims the school has \u201clost its way\u201d by distancing itself from mainstream Catholicism and embracing a \u201cwoke culture\u201d in which priority is given to \u201cgender identity, human sexuality and pregnancy termination among other hot button issues.\u201d The suit also takes issue with a blackboard in a common area that explains how to be an ally to the LGBTQ community, as well as how the school takes on the issue of race, saying white students are made to feel guilty. The Scarpos had paid $240,000 toward the pledge as of 2018, the lawsuit said. The school didn\u2019t discuss details of the suit, but spokeswoman Emily Wise told the Times in an email that the school\u2019s curriculum is based on Catholic values.\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Wednesday declined to block some challenged sections of Georgia\u2019s new election law ahead of two runoff elections next week, but he didn\u2019t rule out the possibility for future elections. Election integrity activists had asked U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee to prohibit the state from enforcing sections of the new law that have to do with observation of elections, as well as a new deadline for requesting absentee ballots. Their request arose from one of eight federal lawsuits challenging the new law. The Republican-backed overhaul of election rules enacted this year has been blasted by Democrats and others who say it creates unnecessary obstacles to voting, particularly for people of color. Most of the lawsuits, including one filed last month by the U.S. Department of Justice, challenge the parts of law that critics say threaten voting rights. The targeted request that led to Wednesday\u2019s ruling, though, focused on provisions mostly related to monitoring or photographing parts of the election process. The activists, led by the Coalition for Good Governance, said those sections criminalize normal election observation activities and could intimidate voters, election observers and members of the news media. A tighter absentee ballot request deadline makes it virtually impossible to get one for a runoff, they argue.\nHonolulu: Lawmakers on Tuesday overrode Gov. David Ige\u2019s veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax on hotel stays and other short-term rentals. Instead, lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. Further, instead of providing the state\u2019s four major counties with a share of transient accommodations tax revenue, the legislation gives the counties the authority to levy their own surcharge to the tax. Currently, the state charges one uniform hotel tax rate across the islands. Sen. Bennette Misalucha, vice chair of the Senate\u2019s Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism Committee, said special funds shouldn\u2019t be protected for the benefit of one industry. She said the Legislature brought special funds like hotel tax revenue into the general fund to stop this practice. The Hawaii Tourism Authority will now be required to get support from lawmakers for its budget just like other state agencies, she said, which will require the agency to be more forthcoming with its strategic plans and force more communication between the agency and lawmakers.\nCoeur d\u2019Alene: High housing prices in northern Idaho are making it difficult to attract police officers, law enforcement officials say. Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Capt. Dave Hagar told the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press that low crime rates and an outdoor lifestyle are big draws but that skyrocketing housing prices are turning people away. \u201cFive years ago, the cost of living in Coeur d\u2019Alene was much more reasonable,\u201d Hagar said. \u201cNow it\u2019s gone above that.\u201d The Coeur d\u2019Alene Association of Realtors said the median residential home sale price was $476,000 in March. That\u2019s a 47% increase from a year ago. Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said his agency has recruited new hires only to have them decline the job after discovering they couldn\u2019t afford housing. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe housing situation is severe.\u201d The agency is looking to hire deputies, dispatchers, control room operators, clerks and jail staff. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to attract local candidates,\u201d Norris said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that when some of our pay is $14 or $15 an hour.\u201d Kootenai County Commissioner Bill Brooks said other county agencies are also having a hard time finding and retaining workers. Wages once considered normal are now not enough.\nChicago: The city\u2019s schools will encourage student COVID-19 vaccinations ahead of the start of the school year with school-based vaccination sites and events, officials announced Wednesday. Officials with the nation\u2019s third-largest school district plan to offer full in-person instruction in the fall and want to vaccinate as many students as possible before classes begin next month. District officials said they are \u201cnot in a position\u201d to mandate COVID-19 shots but will ask families to submit COVID-19 vaccine documents, as is the practice with other immunizations. Starting next week, the district will offer vaccines at three school sites for students and their families. The sites will be able to administer 600 doses weekly. The district is also working with hospitals for events in areas with low inoculation rates and offering the shots at back-to-school events. \u201cSchools are trusted pillars of our communities, and as a district we are uniquely suited to help expand vaccination opportunities, which helps create the safest possible learning environments at our schools,\u201d said Jose M. Torres, interim schools CEO. More than 50,000 children under the age of 18 have already been vaccinated in Chicago, according to the city\u2019s Department of Public Health. Roughly 350,000 students attend Chicago Public Schools.\nIndianapolis: As federal officials debate pouring billions of dollars into broadband access, data suggests many of Indiana\u2019s schoolchildren and adults who preferred to work from home spent the pandemic with subpar access to high-speed internet, particularly in the state\u2019s least-wealthy counties. In about half of Indiana\u2019s counties \u2013 47 of 92 \u2013 measured by a Federal Communications Commission study, broadband access is available to at least 79% of residents. Yet in about half of the state measured by Microsoft \u2013 47 of 92 counties \u2013 no more than 22% of households actually have high-speed access, a USA TODAY analysis shows. President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of Senate moderates have reached a deal on a far-reaching infrastructure plan that would direct $65 billion to increase broadband connectivity from coast to coast. Despite the agreement, it\u2019s unclear whether it would address the solutions some lawmakers want to see such as continued broadband subsidies for low-income families, greater competition among wireless providers, and continued buildout of high-speed networks in poorer, rural areas. In Indiana, 12.4% of residents don\u2019t have adequate broadband infrastructure, and 48.4% live in areas with only one internet provider, according to the White House.\nIowa City: A teenager injured in an accident on an amusement ride that killed his younger brother remained on life support Wednesday as he turned 16, his family pastor said. David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children\u2019s Hospital since Saturday\u2019s accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said. David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said. The pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids said it\u2019s a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church, which planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night, is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000. Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David\u2019s birthday, but \u201cthere won\u2019t be a lot of celebrating,\u201d Shields said. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland on Saturday to celebrate David\u2019s upcoming birthday. The junior at Linn-Mar High School had been excited about getting his driver\u2019s license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has expanded the paid leave that state employees can take from their jobs when they become parents or act as caregivers. Kelly issued an executive order Tuesday that provides an extra two weeks of paid leave for state workers who are a child\u2019s primary caregiver and an extra week for secondary caregivers. The order also makes foster parents eligible for the same paid leave. Primary caregivers will now receive up to eight weeks of paid leave, rather than six. Secondary caregivers will receive four weeks instead of three. The order directed the state Department of Administration to put the new policies into effect immediately. Kelly said the state is demonstrating a commitment to recruiting and keeping talented workers and creating a \u201csupportive environment for our families.\u201d \u201cSupporting working parents in our workforce is not only the right thing to do,\u201d Kelly said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s good for our economy.\u201d The order also says new state employees become eligible for paid leave after 180 days.\nLouisville: After years of planning and public input, the construction phase of the Sherman Minton Bridge rehabilitation project will soon be underway. The Sherman Minton Renewal project team said Tuesday that it will begin working on ramp improvements next week. The improvements \u201care being made to prepare for the first phase of the rehabilitation, which will include the first half of eastbound construction on the lower deck and painting of the bridge trusses,\u201d according to a news release. According to the team, ramp shoulders at the Interstates 65 and 265 interchange, as well as the Interstates 64 and 265 interchange, will be modified to accommodate additional traffic. The modification process will take one to two weeks, the team said, and \u201cwill require nighttime lane closures and/or ramp closures to construct.\u201d After the ramp improvements are completed, traffic will be reduced to two lanes in each direction as the team works on painting and deck replacement preparations. When lanes are restricted, I-65 and I-265 will serve as a detour route, the team said. The Sherman Minton, which spans the Ohio River to connect the Bluegrass and Hoosier states, is 59 years old. The proposal to rehabilitate the double-decker bridge was announced in 2018. The price tag for the project is roughly $137 million.\nBaton Rouge: Authorities say they\u2019ve been searching for a 12-foot python that escaped from its enclosure inside the state\u2019s largest shopping mall. Cara, a yellow and white Burmese python, slithered out of its enclosure at the Blue Zoo in the Mall of Louisiana in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, news outlets report. She was still on the loose early Wednesday morning, WBRZ-TV reports, after a search overnight, when such snakes are most active. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve created a very secure home for Cara, our Burmese Python, she has slithered out of her exhibit,\u201d the Blue Zoo said in a statement. \u201cCara is a non-poisonous, friendly snake that enjoys her time interacting with guests during our Snake Education Shows.\u201d Pythons slowly squeeze their prey to death before swallowing them. Cara was described as \u201cvery sweet\u201d by her handlers, who released a photo of the animal. The Blue Zoo \u2013 which bills itself as \u201cmore than an aquarium, more than a zoo\u201d \u2013 was closed Tuesday while search efforts continued, but the Mall of Louisiana remained open.\nBangor: Enrollment in public schools across the state dropped by 4.4%, nearly 8,000 students, between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, according to Maine Department of Education data. Most of those students transitioned to home schooling, which saw an increase of 5,000 students, according to department data. School systems expect many students to return for the 2021-22 school year, Bangor Daily News reports. According to an Education Week report, Maine had the fourth-highest decrease in the nation behind Vermont\u2019s 5.3% decrease, Mississippi\u2019s 5% drop and New Hampshire\u2019s 4.7% decline. Steve Bailey, executive director at Maine School Management Association, said the change reflects concerns from parents about safety during the pandemic and child care challenges. The most significant decrease was in prekindergarten and kindergarten students, for whom the population decreased by 16%, compared to a 3% decrease in all other students.\nCollege Park: Teenagers will be entered to win $50,000 college scholarships if they get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state\u2019s latest incentive program offered to encourage as many people as possible to get the shots. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the new lottery program Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. Twenty Marylanders between the ages of 12 and 17 will win scholarships worth $50,000 each between now and Labor Day. The program will give away a total of $1 million in scholarships or the equivalent of full tuition and fees at one of Maryland\u2019s public universities. Winners who choose to attend college out of state can transfer the scholarship to the school of their choice, Hogan said. The program will begin Monday and continue through Labor Day. Teens who have been vaccinated in Maryland are eligible and will be automatically entered, the governor said. Winners will be chosen using the same process as \u201cVaxCash,\u201d a lottery for adults that recently ended. That program awarded a total of $2 million in prizes to Marylanders 18 and older who had received a COVID-19 vaccine at any time. The scholarship prizes will be deposited into college savings accounts with Maryland 529.\nTopsfield: A more than 200-year-old agricultural fair canceled last year because of the pandemic is scheduled to return this fall, organizers announced Wednesday. The 11-day Topsfield Fair, first held in 1818, will start Oct. 1, the Essex Agricultural Society said in a statement. \u201cHaving to cancel last year\u2019s Topsfield Fair due to the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating,\u201d General Manager James O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe are thrilled to announce that the fair will return this year with no restrictions, and we look forward to seeing everyone on the fairgrounds in October.\u201d The fair was previously canceled for three years during World War II and in 1918 because of an influenza pandemic. Based on attendance in 1946 after the three-year shutdown, O\u2019Brien said he expects high attendance this fall. In anticipation, fair personnel have installed extra sinks and hand-sanitizing stations around the fairgrounds north of Boston, he said. One of the fair\u2019s most popular events is the giant pumpkin contest, but it also includes livestock exhibits, a midway, vendors, food stalls and live music. It typically draws up to 500,000 visitors per year. A schedule for concerts, which are free with fair admission, will be announced soon.\nRoseville: CARE of Southeastern Michigan is hosting a free, two-week day camp for kids whose family members struggle with addiction. Open for children in preschool through eighth grade, Camp CARE will address communicating effectively, managing emotions, dealing with change, choosing friends wisely, resisting peer pressure and more. The skills are taught through hands-on activities like arts, crafts and games, said CARE director of substance use prevention Kaitlin Maloziec. The Roseville fire and police departments will also visit the camp for a teaching segment in the city about 15 miles northeast of Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s just a spot where kids can be kids, make friendships and see that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Maloziec said. The camp will be held at Fountain Elementary in Roseville from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 19-23 and July 26-30. Zoom sessions for parents and caregivers will teach adults some of the same skills as the youth, along with parenting tips and advice on how to talk about addiction and address kids\u2019 questions. The camp, which Maloziec said has been around for more than two decades, is hosting up to 60 students this year. Most activities will be held outdoors, with mask-wearing required and lunch provided. Registration is available online and closes at 11:45 p.m. Friday.\nMinneapolis: With COVID-19 limits fading away, tourists are returning to Minnesota resorts, many of them from neighboring states. But a lot of employees are not coming back. The worker shortage has been building for more than a year, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for Hospitality Minnesota, the trade association for the state\u2019s hotels, restaurants, resorts and campgrounds. The industry is down about 50,000 workers from its normal summer level of 280,000 to 290,000 workers. Many of them found other jobs during the first COVID-19 shutdown, and others left when a second hospitality shutdown was ordered, the Star Tribune reports. \u201cAfter last year, we were hopeful that things would get back to normal,\u201d said Sue Dutcher, manager of the St. Croix River Resort in Hinckley. Instead, \u201cwe\u2019re being run ragged.\u201d In Detroit Lakes, Joanne Anderson faces a similar challenge at the Forest Hills Resort. Anderson manages Izzo\u2019s, the resort\u2019s bar and restaurant, and is running it with eight workers instead of the usual 20. Some operators have been fortunate enough to escape the labor shortage. The Trail Center Lodge on the Gunflint Trail is \u201c100% staffed,\u201d according to owner Sarah Hamilton. That\u2019s partly due to a new program that brings young adults from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to work at businesses on the North Shore.\nJackson: Farmers in the state are losing the catfish wars against their foreign competitors with the very weapon they saw as their salvation. The domestic catfish industry, along with lawmakers including the late U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, lobbied to move oversight of catfish processing from the Food and Drug Administration to the U.S. Department of Agriculture five years ago with the expectation the USDA\u2019s stricter eye would limit the foreign imports that had decimated domestic production throughout the Mississippi Delta. Instead, imports of siluriformes \u2013 the larger category of catfish and catfish-like fish sometimes referred to by their family name, \u201cpangasius\u201d \u2013 have only increased since the switch to the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service in 2016. Meanwhile, domestic prices and production, mainly in Mississippi and other Southern states, have continued to decline. Almost 65,000 additional tons of catfish were imported in 2019 compared to 2015 before the Food Safety and Inspection Service took over, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service. The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce lists recent processing volumes at 5 million pounds per month less than in 2015 during FDA oversight.\nJefferson City: Seventeen more people in southwest Missouri died from COVID-19 in a two-week period ending Sunday as the coronavirus continues to surge in the region, officials said. The deaths were recorded in the two-week reporting period from June 21 to July 4 and were disclosed Tuesday by the Springfield-Greene County Health Department, the Kansas City Star reports. The dead ranged in age from their 40s to 90s, and none of those who died was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Republican Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday told reporters that his administration has done \u201ceverything possible\u201d to fend off outbreaks. Missouri has reported nearly 530,000 cases of the virus and 9,375 deaths since the pandemic began. The state has administered more than 5 million doses, with 44.9% of the population getting at least one. Parson said he\u2019s focused on encouraging people to get inoculated and making the shots available to them. He said he\u2019s still wary of incentivizing vaccinations with prizes. \u201cRight now, the vaccine\u2019s out there,\u201d Parson said. \u201cI mean, people walk past it every day, whether they\u2019re in a pharmacy, whether they\u2019re in a Walmart, whether they\u2019re in a health center.\u201d Parson also on Wednesday signed a bill into law to limit lawsuits against companies for wrongdoing related to the pandemic.\nHelena: Wildlife officials were searching by ground and from the air Wednesday for a grizzly bear that killed a woman who was camping. A helicopter was flying over the area around the small town of Ovando, in western Montana, in pursuit of the bear, which will be killed if found, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon said. Large traps made out of culverts were set around the area in hopes of capturing the bruin. Ovando, about 60 miles northwest of Helena, is a community of fewer than 100 people at the edge of the sprawling Bob Marshall wilderness. Long-distance bicyclists such as the victim often spend the night in the town. Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said the bear wandered into the victim\u2019s camping area a couple of times before Tuesday\u2019s fatal mauling. Someone at the scene used bear spray, and other campers called 911, Roselles said. Roselles closed down any camping in Ovando as the search for the bear continued, following creeks leading away from the town. Further circumstances surrounding the attack were under investigation. Officials said their priority was to find and kill the bear to prevent another dangerous encounter.\nNiobrara: A tomahawk once owned by Chief Standing Bear, a pioneering Native American civil rights leader, is returning to his Nebraska tribe after decades in a museum at Harvard. The university\u2019s Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology said it\u2019s been working with members of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska and Oklahoma to repatriate the artifact. Larry Wright Jr., chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said Tuesday that the return of the historic weapon is a powerful symbol of homecoming for the tribe, which was among many forcibly relocated from their homelands to other territories by the federal government in the 1800s. Standing Bear was arrested 1878 for leaving the tribe\u2019s reservation in order to fulfill a promise he made to bury his eldest son back in their tribe\u2019s homeland in the Niobrara River Valley. In his landmark federal trial, he successfully argued for the recognition of Native Americans as persons entitled to rights and protection under law. \u201cThat hand is not the color of yours. But if you pierce it, I shall feel pain,\u201d Standing Bear famously said in court. \u201cThe blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.\u201d Wright said the tribe is preparing its own museum, located near Standing Bear\u2019s grave, to properly display the tomahawk and other artifacts.\nLas Vegas: A 110-acre property at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip has been purchased to be the site for a terminal station for a planned new high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and Southern California. Brightline Holdings announced the purchase Tuesday without announcing the price, but local news outlets report that Clark County records indicate the purchase by the holding company for Brightline West closed Thursday for $140 million. The site is on the west side of Las Vegas Boulevard across from Premium Outlets South mall and near McCarran International Airport. Company officials have said Brightline West trains would carry up to 500 passengers at speeds up to 200 mph on the planned route between Las Vegas and Victorville, California. The project has been delayed over the years, most recently because of the pandemic.\nConcord: Plans to close the state\u2019s youth detention center are quickly taking shape, with a consultant due to submit a preliminary report in the next two weeks. The two-year state budget Gov. Chris Sununu signed June 25 includes a mandate to close the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester by March 2023. But the state Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t wait for lawmakers and the governor to act; it signed a $55,000 contract with Alvarez & Marsal Public Sector Services of Washington, D.C., on June 8. The contract, paid for with federal pandemic aid, requires the consultants to deliver a draft closure plan by mid-July and a final report by August. According to details submitted to the governor\u2019s Executive Council last week, the department didn\u2019t have time to solicit bids given the time-sensitive work but consulted with stakeholders before hiring the firm. Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette told the council she met with advocates for juvenile justice, including the Disability Rights Center and the Office of the Child Advocate. \u201cWe have this opportunity to build the right-sized program on a clinical model instead of a detention model. So I brought the advocates together to say, \u2018What is your ideal model?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey said they weren\u2019t qualified and that I should hire a consultant. So that is what I did.\u201d\nBridgewater: The pandemic that closed restaurant dining rooms last year also put a stop to food tours. But with eateries up and running again, food tours are starting back up, too, inviting food lovers to explore a town by enjoying its restaurants\u2019 signature dishes and learning about local history. \u201cFor the first time in 15 months, we are opening public tours again, and it is really exciting,\u201d said Alessia Aron, owner of Beyond the Plate Tours, which presents excursions in Jersey City, Red Bank and Somerville. Local restaurants \u201chave been through hell and back, and we are just trying to support them as much as possible.\u201d Her company, previously Jersey Girls Food Tours, is one of seven that comprise the NJ Food Tour Trail. \u201cWe thought that coming together and creating the New Jersey Food Tour Trail would help us come out of the pandemic better,\u201d said Audrey Wiggins, owner of On the Town Food Tours, another participant. \u201cJuly 1 is our official opening date for all tour companies; some have started a little earlier than that, but everyone is now officially open.\u201d Other NJ Food Tour Trail companies include Asbury Park Food Tours, Cape May Food Tours, Sister Cities Food and Shop Tours, Savor and Stroll Culinary Tours and Have You Met Newark Tours.\nSanta Fe: A new podcast called Parks urges visitors to America\u2019s national parks to educate themselves about and acknowledge the Indigenous tribes whose ties to these sacred spaces span millennia. The aim of the documentary podcast is to explore the history of tribes on these lands, the ways in which the lands were dispossessed, issues the Indigenous communities face today, and how they\u2019ve kept their culture and traditions alive, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that was written, but when it was written, it was from the point of view of Eastern colonizers,\u201d said Mary Mathis, 25, a former photo editor at National Public Radio and Outside magazine who serves as the host of Parks, co-created with fellow Santa Fe-based multimedia journalist Cody Nelson. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t every story, it was just one story \u2013 the quote-unquote \u2018winner\u2019s\u2019 story. We see that a lot in our education system, and I think that was where the idea (for Parks) kind of came from.\u201d The first episode follows a format the Parks team plans to replicate throughout the project, one in which Indigenous guests are closely involved in each step of the editing process so as to maintain complete ownership of their stories.\nNew York: A consortium of businesses and nonprofits will run Central Park\u2019s Wollman ice rink, one of four recreational concessions that were operated by Donald Trump\u2019s company until the city canceled its contracts with the former president, the city Department of Parks and Recreation announced Tuesday. A joint venture called Wollman Park Partners LLC is expected to be awarded a five-year contract to run the rink after submitting the winning bid for the project, city officials said. The joint venture, which includes Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, Related Companies, Equinox, caterer Great Performances and local groups such as Ice Hockey in Harlem, will reinvest all profits into upgrading the rink, city officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Summer of New York City, but we\u2019re already preparing for an iconic winter, too,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that NYC Parks has found a quality operator for Wollman Rink that is committed to reinvesting in the community and creating a welcoming space for all New Yorkers.\u201d The Democrat announced in January that the city would terminate business contracts with the Trump Organization over Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The cancellations affected a golf course in the Bronx and a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park.\nRaleigh: A Superior Court judge put a small-town newspaper editor behind bars last month after one of his reporters used an audio recorder for note-taking purposes at a murder trial \u2013 a punishment the paper and media rights groups consider excessive. Judge Stephan Futrell sentenced Gavin Stone, the news editor of the Richmond County Daily Journal, to five days in jail before having the editor hauled off to jail. Stone was released the next day but still faces the possibility of more time in lockup. Brian Bloom, the paper\u2019s publisher, acknowledged that his reporter shouldn\u2019t have had the recorder in court because it was not allowed but criticized the judge\u2019s move to imprison an editor for a minor infraction committed by a colleague. \u201cThe penalty does not fit the crime,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put this in perspective: You stop a murder trial not once, but twice, because a guy had a tape recorder sitting next to him on a bench at a courtroom. Let\u2019s put our priorities in place here.\u201d Futrell did not respond to a request for comment. Superior Court rules allow electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings but grant judges the authority to prohibit the technology.\nMandan: The Mandan City Commission has agreed to equip the community\u2019s police force with body cameras. The commission approved the cameras unanimously Tuesday with no discussion. The police department received a quote from Digital-Ally, which already has cameras inside the police vehicles. A memo from police to commissioners said that using the same company for the cameras will allow for better integration of the equipment, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The package of 28 body cameras, upgraded in-car cameras, accessories, set-up, training and cloud storage would cost about $165,000 for a five-year subscription. The police department also received approval to request funding from the U.S. Department of Justice to offset the cost of the cameras. It is asking for nearly $37,000 over five years, according to the memo. The Lincoln Police Department began using body cameras in early 2020. The Bismarck Police Department and the Burleigh County Sheriff\u2019s Department do not use the technology.\nCincinnati: The top prosecutor in one of the state\u2019s most populous counties has decided his office will no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters announced his decision Tuesday, saying it would take effect immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s time for this nonsense to end,\u201d Deters said. The directive comes in the wake of a violent holiday weekend in Cincinnati. Among the incidents was a Fourth of July shooting at a downtown park where authorities say a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy opened fire on each other, leaving both of them dead and three innocent bystanders wounded. Hundreds of teens were gathered at Smale Park when the shooting occurred shortly before 11 p.m. Sunday, authorities say. At the time, police officers were working to clear out the riverfront park before its closing time. \u201cPeople must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019 \u201d Deters said. \u201cNo amount of money can fix the problems we are facing. Parents must parent their children. Communities must speak up.\u201d\nEdmond: U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe\u2019s office announced Wednesday that he requested $4 million in federal funds to help combat illegal marijuana growing operations in the state. Inhofe\u2019s chief of staff, Luke Holland, announced the request during an Oklahoma Sheriffs Association meeting, saying Inhofe requested a direct appropriation through the U.S. Justice Department to allow the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to establish a unit to combat \u201ctransnational and national drug organizations.\u201d The unit would work with sheriffs to combat illegal drug operations. Medical marijuana is a booming business in Oklahoma, where voters in 2018 approved one of the nation\u2019s most liberal medical programs. As a result, out-of-state weed entrepreneurs have flocked to the state to get involved. But sheriffs and other law enforcement groups, which opposed the state question in 2018, have said illegal marijuana grow operations are setting up in rural parts of Oklahoma and funneling cannabis into the illegal drug trade in Oklahoma and other states.\nEugene: The University of Oregon said Tuesday that it will start the second phase of building the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact after receiving another $500 million donation for the project. Construction on the first phase of the new campus started in 2016 \u2013 after the first half-billion-dollar gift from the Nike co-founder and his wife \u2013 with a large science building including a pedestrian bridge over the street. A second building for \u201cbioengineering and applied science research building to support expanded research programs and facilities\u201d will be built next, according to a university news release. The building is planned to cover 175,000 square feet, with multiple stories, and be located north of the first building. The focus of the new campus is to translate scientific discoveries into advances in health care and other fields. The latest money will also pay for 14 to 16 additional faculty members and their teams. The new campus currently employs 13 tenure-related faculty members and their research teams, for a total of about 90 employees. \u201cThe aim of the new campus is to compress the timeline between discovery and \u201csocietal impact,\u201d said Robert Guldberg, vice president and executive director of the new science operation.\nHarrisburg: Tolls on the Pennsylvania Turnpike will rise another 5% in January, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission decided Tuesday. The agency board voted to impose the higher rates as of Jan. 2. The most common E-ZPass fare for a passenger vehicle will rise by a dime, from $1.60 to $1.70. Those being charged through a scan of their license plate will see the most common fare go from $3.90 to $4.10. The most common truck fare will go from $13 to $13.70 for E-ZPass and from $26.60 to $28 for toll-by-plate. Officials say 2022 will be the first time in six years that fares will have jumped by less than 6%. The turnpike has pumped more than $7 billion in funding from tolls to the state Transportation Department since 2007.\nProvidence: Almost $54 million worth of fraudulent unemployment claims have been filed during the coronavirus pandemic, state officials say. The latest total is about $9 million more than in May, with even more victims coming forward in the past month, according to WJAR-TV. State Department of Labor and Training Director Matt Weldon said that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the claims were filed during that time span, just that they are coming to light now. The agency has managed to get back about $3.75 million so far with the help of federal agencies, but Weldon said he believes that will grow significantly in the coming months. The agency is also enforcing rules that require people to look for work while collecting benefits, he said. With 64,000 Rhode Islanders receiving unemployment benefits, that will be a slow process, with the agency only able to get through a few hundred claims per week to start, he said. \u201cAs you can imagine, trying to audit claims and go through information is difficult when there are more than a workable number, so we are going to begin with hundreds and see how that goes, and then that can grow in the future,\u201d he said.\nColumbia: The governor wants a new abortion law to take effect, arguing Wednesday that a judge\u2019s decision to put the whole measure \u2013 and not just the parts being challenged in court \u2013 on hold during a lawsuit \u201coversteps the bounds of federal judicial power.\u201d Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s brief with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asks appellate judges to lift a lower court\u2019s injunction on the South Carolina Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act. The Republican signed the measure into law earlier this year that requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a heartbeat in the fetus, which can typically be detected about six weeks after conception. If cardiac activity is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Planned Parenthood attorneys sued immediately, and the entire law has been blocked from going into effect during the litigation. In his brief, attorneys for McMaster argued that decision represents \u201coverreaching federal power to interfere with state law.\u201d McMaster, along with other defendants including state Attorney General Alan Wilson, also argue that the groups that sued don\u2019t have proper standing to challenge the law.\nMadison: An increasing number of primarily social media complaints from residents in Madison and Lake County have brought to light a little-known county ordinance banning people from occupying their campers or recreational vehicles outside the confines of a campground. Lake County Planning and Zoning Officer Mandi Anderson said the ordinance has gone undetected for many years until a recent barrage of postings that have led to heated debate among residents. Some who are opposed to the rule say that it infringes on property rights and that there should be nothing wrong with letting visitors use a camper for a short time. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was this out of hand,\u201d Anderson said. One theory for the ordinance, Anderson said, is that people who construct large lakeside homes on small lots do not want to be inundated with noise from adjoining property when three campers pull in for the weekend and 50 people take up temporary residence, The Madison Daily Leader reports. Anderson said citations are only issued if the matter is not addressed after the property owner has been notified about the ordinance and has been given an opportunity to comply. She emphasized she does not drive around looking for violators but only responds to complaints.\nNashville: City officials are inviting the public to celebrate and remember civil rights icon John Lewis in a dedication ceremony next week. Earlier this year, Nashville\u2019s Metro Council renamed a large portion of Fifth Avenue North to Rep. John Lewis Way. Councilwoman Zulfat Suara submitted the request last year, focusing on Lewis\u2019 work to desegregate Nashville\u2019s lunch counters before becoming a long-serving congressman in Georgia. The city will host a dedication July 16-17. The event was originally scheduled for February but was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak. As a college student at American Baptist College and then Fisk University, Lewis helped desegregate public spaces in Nashville and pushed for racial justice across the South. Lewis was a Freedom Rider, spoke at the March on Washington, and was beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Lewis died July 17, 2020. He was 80.\nSan Antonio: A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Air Force is mostly responsible for a former serviceman killing more than two dozen people at a church in 2017 because it failed to submit his criminal history into a database, which should have prevented him from purchasing firearms. U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez in San Antonio wrote in a ruling signed Wednesday that the Air Force was \u201c60% responsible\u201d for the massacre at First Baptist Church in the small town of Sutherland Springs, where Devin Kelley opened fire during a Sunday service. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the 25 people killed was pregnant. The attack remains the worst mass shooting in Texas history. \u201cThe trial conclusively established that no other individual \u2013 not even Kelley\u2019s own parents or partners \u2013 knew as much as the United States about the violence that Devin Kelley had threatened to commit and was capable of committing,\u201d Rodriguez wrote. Kelley had served nearly five years in the Air Force before being discharged in 2014 for bad conduct, after he was convicted of assaulting a former wife and stepson, cracking the child\u2019s skull. The Air Force has publicly acknowledged that the felony conviction for domestic violence, had it been put into the FBI database, could have prevented Kelley from buying guns from licensed firearms dealers and from possessing body armor.\nSalt Lake City: Hospital leaders renewed their pleas for people to get vaccinated Wednesday as the state experiences another surge in new coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant. That strain has begun to surge in Utah over the past month and now represents about 80% of cases in the state, said Dr. Michelle Hofmann, deputy director of the state health department. Utah has averaged about 386 confirmed cases per day over the past week, nearly double the case rate the state was experiencing at its lowest point in early June. The surge is largely occurring in unvaccinated people who are being infected and hospitalized at six times the rate of vaccinated people, Hoffman said. \u201cThe frustrating part about all of this is that, unlike last year, we have all the tools to stop this pandemic in its tracks,\u201d Hoffman told reporters during a virtual briefing. \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccines work.\u201d Utah now ranks fourth in the nation for new cases per capita, and the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 31% over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Utah met health officials\u2019 goal of vaccinating 70% of adults and 25% of children ages 12 to 15 with at least one dose by the Fourth of July, but hospital leaders say more people need to be vaccinated to avoid hospitals from being overrun again.\nKillington: The FIS Ski World Cup will be returning to the Killington Ski Resort this November. Over the years the event has drawn tens of thousands of people to the town on Thanksgiving weekend. It was canceled last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mike Solimano, president and general manager of Killington Resort & Pico Mountain, said in a news release that in addition to skiing, there will be a full weekend of activities, including live music. Joshua Eckler, owner of Trailside Inn, told the Rutland Herald he thinks this will be a big year for the World Cup, given the past 14 months of travel restrictions. \u201cWe try to encourage a lot of guests to come for it even if they\u2019re not ski racing fans because it\u2019s more of an experience,\u201d Eckler said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a die-hard racing fan to enjoy the event, just because of the music and the atmosphere and the excitement \u2013 everybody is screaming for everybody.\u201d\nRichmond: Workers removed a statue of Harry F. Byrd Sr., a former governor, U.S. senator and staunch segregationist, from the state\u2019s Capitol Square on Wednesday morning. A crane hoisted the larger-than-life statue off its pedestal, and workers then strapped it to a truck to be hauled into storage until lawmakers determine its final disposition. Byrd, a Democrat, ran the state\u2019s most powerful political machine for decades until his death in 1966 and was considered the architect of the state\u2019s racist \u201cmassive resistance\u201d policy to public school integration. Lawmakers voted to remove the statue earlier this year, a decision that came amid a years\u00adlong movement in history-rich Virginia to rethink who is honored in the state\u2019s public spaces. The statue erected in 1976 was located a stone\u2019s throw from the Capitol. A nearby plaque said the statue was dedicated in appreciation of Byrd\u2019s \u201cdevotion throughout a long public career to governmental restraint and programs in the best interest of all the people of Virginia.\u201d Byrd\u2019s son, the late Harry Byrd Jr., a Democrat-turned-independent who began his career as a segregationist, succeeded his father in the Senate, serving until 1983.\nRichland: A new state report finds that more than 57% of Hanford Nuclear Reservation workers reported exposure to hazardous material on the former nuclear weapons production site in south-central Washington state. The Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board recently released its final report and recommendations on the unmet health care needs of Hanford workers. The report\u2019s central recommendation calls for creation of a new, independent Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Center. It would provide a centralized clearinghouse for dissemination of accepted scientific literature. Important functions would also include evaluation and communication of newly available studies about Hanford-specific hazards. For incurable diseases such as chronic beryllium disease, information sharing could be key to finding cures. Additionally, the center would promote research to increase the body of knowledge for the Hanford workforce. Hanford for decades made plutonium for nuclear weapons, and thousands of workers are now tasked with cleaning up the nation\u2019s largest volume of radioactive wastes. \u201cThe working families that make up the Hanford community represent a very unique population, with occupational risks not easily quantified or identified,\u201d said Nickolas A. Bumpaous, Hanford Healthy Energy Workers Board co-chair.\nCharleston: Traffic on the West Virginia Turnpike around the Fourth of July weekend was the heaviest since 2010. The turnpike saw 668,000 vehicles pass through its toll booths between Thursday and Monday, the state Department of Transportation said in a news release Tuesday. That\u2019s 28% higher than for the five-day period a year ago, when travel was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt was a huge Fourth of July period,\u201d said West Virginia Parkways Authority executive director Jeff Miller. \u201cPeople are just ready to get out and travel.\u201d Miller said many travelers started trips the weekend before the Fourth of July and returned home the weekend after. Between June 27 and Monday, more than 1.12 million vehicles went through the turnpike\u2019s toll booths, the statement said.\nMadison: In a cheese-obsessed state that proudly touts itself as America\u2019s Dairyland, the dairy cow is the official domestic animal, milk is the official state beverage, and cheese is the official dairy product. But even though Wisconsin produces more cheese than any other state at 3.4 billion pounds each year, there is no official state cheese. A bipartisan bill heard by a state Assembly committee on Wednesday would change that. The measure makes colby, which was created in Wisconsin more than 100 years ago, the official cheese. Colby may be as \u201cgouda\u201d choice as any, but the choice threatens to turn fans of cheddar, swiss, provolone and other varieties red, or perhaps blue, in the face with rage. Colby also holds a special place in Wisconsin cheese history. It was created in the central Wisconsin city of Colby in 1885 by Joseph Steinwand, who named it after the township where his father built northern Clark County\u2019s first cheese factory, according to a state historical marker in the city, located about 40 miles west of Wausau. Colby isn\u2019t the most-produced cheese in Wisconsin. Mozzarella is tops, followed by cheddar and some Italian varieties, according to the USDA. Still, more than 45 million pounds of colby are produced at Wisconsin\u2019s 150 cheese plants each year.\nCheyenne: The state\u2019s first female federal district judge plans to semi-retire in 2022, opening the way for Democratic President Joe Biden to nominate a judge in the deeply Republican state. Going on senior status will give U.S. District Judge Nancy Freudenthal in Cheyenne more control over the number and type of cases she oversees. She plans to spend more of her free time with her husband, former Gov. Dave Freudenthal, and grandchildren, Freudenthal told the Casper Star-Tribune. She hasn\u2019t decided yet how she will use her time as judge but might stop taking new criminal cases to provide freedom from speedy trial requirements, she said. Freudenthal had no experience with criminal cases before becoming a federal district judge in 2010. She has found those cases the most rewarding because they can be life-changing for convicts, Freudenthal said. \u201cYes, their lives going forward will still be very challenging, but they have the opportunity to rebuild that life, take advantage of resources, hopefully live a life of sobriety,\u201d she said. Freudenthal, 67, holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. She was an attorney in the offices of Govs. Ed Herschler and Mike Sullivan from 1980 to 1989."

She will co-host the night with celebrity DJ and entertainer Rick Joyner. Lynn said there will be 17 music pieces in the show's first half, all of which are tributes to America. Midway through, Lynn said they will have four singalongs for the audience to participate. Stars and Stripes Forever also features dance performances by Alabama State University's BFA Dance Program and the Montgomery Ballet. Performances will close out with a set from the 10-piece group MGM Soul Collective.\nAnchorage: A Montana man was reunited with his 14-week-old border collie two days after the dog disappeared following a bear attack on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula. Jason Umbriaco was hospitalized after the brown bear with two cubs bit him twice Sunday, Alaska\u2019s News Source reported. \u201cIt was just a shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Umbriaco said after being reunited with Buckley. \u201cI had kind of given up hope, and I was sort of making preparations inside to just move forward without him, and now it\u2019s like I\u2019m gonna have those times back of just joy, and peace.\u201d The attack happened in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, about 60 miles south of Anchorage, while he and Buckley were hiking. Umbriaco said the bear moved on him so fast, he didn\u2019t have time to pull out his bear spray. He said the bear covered about 50 feet \u201cin an instant. So then I held my arms up in sort of a defensive position and then she bit me on the forearm kind of up close to my elbow.\u201d When the bear let go, he panicked and jumped into the adjacent Kenai River. \u201cIn almost any other circumstance and in probably this circumstance, it was a terrible option, but that was the one I had,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then she reaches down and then bites me on the shoulder.\u201d The bear retreated after the second bite and was last seen walking up a hill with her cubs.\nTucson: The Air Force wants to free up space for more fighter aircraft at Nellis Air Force Base in metro Las Vegas by transferring attack and rescue aircraft to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. Under realignment plans announced Wednesday with an Air Force budget request, units operating A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jets and HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters would be transferred to Davis-Monthan. The transfers from Nellis are intended to allow the Air Force to assign F-35A Lightning II and F-22 Raptor fighters to the Nevada base for testing and training while locating more rescue units together at Davis-Monthan, according to Air Force statements. The first phase of the proposed plan is contingent on congressional approval of retirement of 42 A-10s, including 35 at Davis-Monthan, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force said it will conduct a required environmental analysis before the moves are made and that it plans to modernize 218 of its current fleet of 281 combat-capable A-10s. The Air Force in 2019 awarded a contract for the purchase of new wings for 218 A-10s. With avionic modernizations, the aircraft will be ably to fly well into the 2030s, the Air Force said.\nLittle Rock: The sponsor of Arkansas\u2019 voter ID law said he will challenge the incumbent secretary of state in next year\u2019s Republican primary. State Rep. Mark Lowery announced he would oppose Secretary of State John Thurston for the Republican nomination. Thurston was first elected in 2018 and is seeking a new term. Lowery sponsored a 2017 law that reinstated the state\u2019s requirement that voters show photo identification before being allowed to cast a ballot. A previous voter ID law had been struck down by the state Supreme Court, but justices in 2018 upheld Lowery\u2019s revision. Lowery also sponsored a measure enacted this year that removed the ability of people without identification to cast a ballot if they sign an affidavit affirming their identity. Lowery has served in the state House since 2013.\nAvalon: A 15-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark Wednesday morning while kayaking off Santa Catalina Island, authorities said. The boy, who was taking part in a Boy Scouts camp, was with his father when their kayak was bumped by what was believed to be a shark of unknown type or size, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said in a statement. \u201cDuring the encounter, the boy had put his hand in the water\u201d and was bitten, lifeguard spokesman Pono Barnes with the Fire Department said. The Boy Scouts of America said the boy was near the Emerald Bay Camp when he received a bite that was not life-threatening. A camp doctor and paramedic treated the boy and he was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition to have surgery, authorities said. It was the first shark-related injury in the nearly 100-year history of its Emerald Bay Camp, the Boy Scouts said. The Boy Scouts said a morning boat check of the waters before the incident hadn\u2019t turned up any hazards. Water activities at the camp have now been cancelled, the organization said. Lifeguards also cleared and closed down a stretch of ocean for 24 hours.\nDenver: Students in American Indian tribes with historical ties to Colorado will receive in-state tuition at public Colorado universities starting this fall. Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill Monday requiring universities to provide in-state tuition in recognition that many American Indian tribes were forced to leave Colorado and that students who belong to tribes that left weren\u2019t getting in-state tuition at the place their tribe considered home. At one point, there were at least 48 tribes in Colorado, 46 of which are no longer in the state. The law reads that because students in these tribes might have been forced to move away from Colorado, or their \u201chistoric home place,\u201d and because American Indians have low rates of students attending college and high rates of poverty, Colorado should provide them in-state tuition. In 2021, Colorado State University had just 141 students \u2013 less than 1% of its undergraduate population \u2013 who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native. American Indian students made up just 1.5% of the undergraduate population at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose board of regents supported the bill through the legislature.\nStonington: The Stonington Historical Society will hold its annual Independence Day parade beginning at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, beginning at the southwest corner of Wadawanuck Square. The public is encouraged to join the informal parade as it processes to Cannon Square and then back to Wadawanuck Square. Ann-Marie Houle, a local teacher and Stonington native, and Tom McCoy, a former Borough crossing guard, will serve as the Grand Marshalls of the parade. After the parade, the Declaration of Independence will be read aloud. As is a local tradition, attendees will then cast a pox on King George after the reading.\nRehoboth Beach: The Grove Park Canal Dock is finished and open to the public as a new route to reach Rehoboth Beach. Although the canal has always been an essential part of the city, the completion of this new dock allows people access to the waterway that before wasn\u2019t possible. The new dock includes a pathway that takes visitors to the water with fresh landscaping and native plants on either side. People can ride up to the dock in private boats to briefly tie up for loading and unloading of passengers or materials, according to city spokesperson Lynne Coan. Anyone with a kayak can also launch from this dock. \u201cIt\u2019s not meant to really double as a marina or a long-term tie up,\u201d said Scott Thomas, executive director of Southern Delaware Tourism. \u201cIt\u2019s a transient dock.\u201d\nWashington: New Balance is taking advantage of the recent focus on D.C. statehood by releasing a shoe that embodies pride in the city, WUSA-TV reported. Designed by June Sanders, who was born in the District and raised in Prince George's County, the shoe uses the D.C. flag as its focal point, and is intended to help people \"discover and celebrate\" D.C. The 992DC is for sale on the DTLR website for about $200 and at store locations across D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\nDaytona Beach: An exit off Interstate 95 had to be closed for 3 hours after 100 homing pigeons fell off a truck and refused to move, posing a driving hazard to motorists, officials said. A crate carrying 100 homing pigeons fell off the truck late Tuesday near Daytona Beach. Because the birds roost at night, the pigeons stayed on the road until bright lights from vehicles startled them. They flew into the air and created a hazard for drivers, according to a news release from Volusia County officials. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst case scenario \u2013 homing pigeons that can\u2019t find their home,\u201d the news release said. Sheriff\u2019s deputies, state troopers and animal service workers attempted to capture the pigeons, ultimately recovering 73 fowl. The birds weren\u2019t banded so their owner wasn\u2019t immediately determined, officials said. \u201cOur job is to help animals find their way home, whether they\u2019re covered in fur, scales, or in this case feathers,\u201d said Volusia County Animal Control Officer Alicia Dease. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping someone out there might have information on where these birds came from or the truck that was carrying them.\u201d\nAtlanta: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is endorsing a Democrat-turned-Republican who\u2019s challenging Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the state\u2019s 2022 Republican primary. Giuliani spoke to reporters Wednesday before headlining a fundraising dinner for former state Rep. Vernon Jones in Atlanta. Jones was on the outs with his party when he shot to prominence in Republican circles as an African American Democrat who endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Jones has since switched parties and doubled down in support of Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud, appealing to Republican voters in Georgia who might be unhappy with Kemp. Trump has repeatedly attacked Kemp but has not endorsed Jones. Giuliani said his main reason for endorsing Jones was their shared belief that Trump was cheated out of Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes and the overall election. \u201cThe current governor has been a failure. I mean, he\u2019s had his time. He put together an election that wouldn\u2019t have passed muster in Africa, Asia, in undeveloped countries,\u201d Giuliani said.\nKailua-Kona: The state has asked the public to comment on a proposal to install mooring buoys to address overcrowding at two popular manta ray viewing sites off the Kona Coast. The Department of Land and Natural Resources said it plans to install 13 of the buoys at Kaukalaelae Point, off Keauhou, and 12 at Makako Bay, off Keahole Point. The plan would remove and reconfigure existing moorings at the sites, which weren\u2019t permitted and haven\u2019t been managed or maintained by the state, West Hawaii Today reported. The moorings would protect natural resources by eliminating the use of chains and anchors that can damage coral reefs, the department said. More manta ray viewing tour boats could also use the sites if the buoys were installed. A 2015 study by Marine Science Consulting LLC found that the manta tours host up to 300 divers and snorkelers nightly with an estimated 60 operators competing for space and access at the two sites.\nSandpoint: Wildlife officials said a backcountry camper killed a moose in self defense after the animal charged him and his dog. The Department of Fish and Game said in a prepared statement that the incident happened last week when the camper was at Harrison Lake, north of Sandpoint. The moose tore apart the man\u2019s campsite and charged the camper and his dog. The camper hid behind a tree, according to the department, but the moose didn\u2019t stop charging. That\u2019s when the camper shot the animal at close range, killing it. Officials with the Fish and Game Department responded to the shooting, and the U.S. Forest Service has since closed the Harrison Lake trailhead to hikers so they don\u2019t encounter any bears that might feed on the carcass. Moose in Idaho can weigh as much as 1,100 pounds, with bulls standing nearly 6 feet high at the shoulder. State wildlife officials said hikers should make noise to avoid surprising moose or other potentially dangerous wildlife, and that if a moose puts its ears back or raises the hair on its neck, it might be about to charge. The Department of Fish and Game said people should carry bear spray when hiking or camping because it can be used to deter many animals in unsafe encounters.\nChicago: After 40 days without solid food, Rachelle Zola ended her hunger strike for slavery reparations Saturday with a few small bites of yogurt. Zola, 73, of Chicago said she lost 23 pounds and felt weak during her last two days of drinking only water, Pedialyte and bone broth. But she pronounced the experience an unqualified success, citing dozens of productive conversations with ordinary people, as well as TV, radio and print newspaper coverage of her fast for H.R. 40, a U.S. House bill that would establish a federal commission to hold hearings on slavery and discrimination and recommend remedies. \u201cMy voice is only getting stronger,\u201d Zola said Monday. Zola, who is white, came to Chicago from Tucson, Arizona, in 2019 to meet Black and brown people and hear their stories, and embarked on the fast as a result of multiple conversations, meetings and workshops. She hoped to attract the attention of other white people, and spur the adoption of H.R. 40, a version of a reparations bill that was first introduced in Congress more than 30 years ago.\nIndianapolis: Indiana\u2019s COVID-19 precautions further eased Thursday under new executive orders issued by Gov. Eric Holcomb, even as he cited worries about the state\u2019s lagging vaccination rate. The state\u2019s public health emergency was extended until at least the end of July as Holcomb on Wednesday signed the 16th renewal of that order that he first issued in March 2020. Holcomb\u2019s order said its renewal ensures Indiana can continue responding effectively to the pandemic. It also keeps the state eligible for additional Medicaid funding and other federal assistance programs. The governor pointed out that Indiana\u2019s fully vaccinated rate of 48% ranks the state 38th in the country \u2013 and that 98.5% of new COVID-19 infections are among unvaccinated people. The coronavirus \u201cremains a threat to the health, safety and welfare of all residents of Indiana,\u201d the order said.\nDes Moines: A federal judge in Iowa admitted wrongdoing and publicly apologized for comments ridiculing former President Donald Trump for issuing a series of pardons to well-connected Republican officials. Senior U.S. District Judge Robert Pratt made the remarks during a phone interview with the Associated Press in December, saying: \"It's not surprising a criminal like Trump pardons other criminals.\" In a bit of humor, he added, \"But apparently to get a pardon, one has to be either a Republican, a convicted child murderer or a turkey.\" Pratt's remarks set off a firestorm of criticism among lawyers, who said that they were inappropriate from a federal judge. They also triggered a judicial misconduct complaint against Pratt by Lavenski Smith, chief judge of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, where Pratt has long worked at the Des Moines courthouse, this week posted online a letter dated April 16 from Pratt to Smith. Pratt said he accepted Smith's conclusion that his comments constitute \"cognizable misconduct\" because they veered into what could be construed as \"inappropriate partisan statements.\" The court said it was posting the letter at Smith's direction. Pratt has been on the bench since his appointment by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1997. He has had a reduced caseload since 2012, when he assumed senior status.\nWichita: Kansas\u2019 largest school district won\u2019t require students and teacher to wear face masks or get a COVID-19 vaccination during the upcoming school year. The Wichita Eagle reported that the Board of Education for Wichita Public Schools reviewed the district\u2019s reopening plan, but took no formal action. The board previously delegated COVID-19 operational decisions to the superintendent. The mask requirement in district facilities will end Tuesday.\nLouisville: The Kentucky State Fair, which takes place Aug. 19-29, will offer special deals on admission as it reopens to the public, officials said. Early bird tickets are available beginning Friday for $8 per person, which includes parking, fair officials said in a statement. The price is good through Aug. 5. Admission at the gate is $10 per person, plus parking. \u201cAfter a year without having a public Fair, we thought it was important to focus on accessibility so we could bring as many Kentuckians together to experience the concerts, the food and the fun unique to our annual festival,\u201d said David S. Beck, president and CEO of Kentucky Venues. The annual event in Louisville featuring shows, exhibits and other entertainment was closed to the public last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some events were held but only participants were allowed to attend.\nMorehouse Parish: A bear that gained a social media following while wandering hundreds of miles in the Midwest before reaching Louisiana has died after being hit by a vehicle, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said Wednesday. The male bear dubbed Bruno was euthanized Tuesday because there was no way he could have survived, said Maria Davidson, large carnivore program manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Not only were both back legs broken, but they were paralyzed because of spinal injuries, she said: \u201cHe had been dragging himself, literally.\u201d Biologists estimated that Bruno had been injured about a month before a homeowner in Morehouse Parish, which is on the Arkansas state line in northeastern Louisiana, called the department Tuesday, saying a bear wouldn\u2019t leave the yard. Biologists went there. \u201cHe was in bad shape. It was rough,\u201d Davidson said.\nBath: The U.S. Navy pulled the plug, for now, on a futuristic weapon that fires projectiles at up to seven times the speed of sound using electricity. The Navy spent more than a decade developing the electromagnetic railgun and once considered putting them on the stealthy new Zumwalt-class destroyers built at Maine\u2019s Bath Iron Works. But the Defense Department is turning its attention to hypersonic missiles to keep up with China and Russia, and the Navy cut funding for railgun research from its latest budget proposal. \u201cThe railgun is, for the moment, dead,\u201d said Matthew Caris, a defense analyst at Avascent Group, a consulting firm. The Navy\u2019s decision to pause research at year\u2019s end frees up resources for hypersonic missiles, directed-energy systems like lasers and electronic warfare systems, said Lt. Courtney Callaghan, a Navy spokesperson.\nAnnapolis: Federal and state authorities are offering more than $20,000 in rewards in the fatal shooting of the Texas mother of a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman candidate as she sat outside a Maryland hotel. Michelle Cummings, 57, of Houston was killed early Tuesday outside the Graduate Hotel in Annapolis, where she was dropping her son off at the academy, city police said. Cummings was the mother of Midshipman Candidate Leonard Cummings III, a plebe, or incoming freshman, and football prospect, according to the Naval Academy. Induction for the incoming class began Tuesday, kicking off basic midshipman training called Plebe Summer. Investigators believe that Cummings was struck by a stray bullet while she was on the hotel\u2019s patio, said Annapolis Police Chief Edward Jackson. Two people were sitting in an SUV on a nearby street when shots rang out and Cummings was struck at least once, Jackson said at a news conference Wednesday.\nAmesbury: A mixed-media painting attributed to Pablo Picasso has been sold after spending 50 years in a closet in a house in Maine. John McInnis Auctioneers, based in Massachusetts, confirmed that the painting entitled \u201cLe Tricorne\u201d sold on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. The 16-by-16-inch painting is signed and dated in the year 1919. It is believed to be a study for the stage curtain Picasso painted for a ballet of the same name that debuted that year in London, according to the New York Historical Society. That curtain has been on display at the historical society in New York City since 2015. The website liveauctioneers.com reported the sale price of the painting was $150,000, plus a 24% buyer\u2019s premium. Neither the buyer nor the seller was named, but the seller gave a statement on the website saying the painting was found in a closet of a home his father inherited from a female relative who studied art in Europe in the 1920s. The buyer will have at least 120 days to authenticate the painting with The Claude Picasso Administration, which is managed by the artist\u2019s son.\nLansing: About $5 million in cash and college scholarships will be given away in lottery-style drawings aimed at raising Michigan\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination rate, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Thursday. The incentive program features a $2 million jackpot, a $1 million prize and 30 daily drawings of $50,000 for residents ages 18 and older who have gotten at least one shot. Vaccinated residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for one of nine four-year prepaid tuition contracts valued at $55,000. The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes is being launched after several states, including Ohio, offered millions of dollars to boost vaccinations \u2013 with mixed results. Nearly 62% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have received at least one dose, ranking it near the middle among states, as infections have plummeted. Whitmer and state health officials want 70% vaccinated, which would require about 678,000 additional people to get a shot.\nMinnetonka: A juvenile has died in a collision involving two Jet Skis on Lake Minnetonka\u2019s Upper East Lake, according to Hennepin County sheriff\u2019s officials. The sheriff\u2019s water patrol responded to a call shortly before 6 p.m. Wednesday and found one person unresponsive. According to authorities, boaters on the lake had pulled the young person from the water and started CPR before the water patrol arrived. The victim was taken to the patrol\u2019s headquarters in Spring Park where an ambulance was waiting. Officials said the person operating the other Jet Ski was not seriously injured. The juvenile who died has not yet been identified.\nOcean Springs: A centuries-old live oak tree that survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005 faces removal because arborists said it could fall onto a playground that sits in its shade. The oak in Fort Maurepas Park in the city of Ocean Springs took another pounding from Hurricane Zeta last year. It now leans west, with limbs extending over the playground. The Ocean Springs Board of Alderman voted June 15 to take the tree down after an arborist who inspected it in November said the root system is failing, the Sun Herald reported. Residents invited another arborist to inspect the tree Monday, the newspaper reported. Several residents, Alderman Rickey Authement and Mayor-Elect Kenny Holloway attended. But the second arborist\u2019s conclusion largely matched the original arborist\u2019s. He recommended removing the tree, estimated to be at least 200 years old, because of liability involving the playground.\nBranson: Health officials working to boost lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates in Missouri are growing anxious as the Fourth of July weekend approaches, creating ripe conditions for the fast-spreading delta variant to send hospital numbers climbing. \u201cWe are just kind of keeping an eye to see what is going to happen,\u201d Lisa Marshall, the health director for Taney County, which includes the tourist town of Branson. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that these numbers can jump pretty quickly.\u201dMissouri is second only to Nevada for having the worst diagnosis rate over the past week. And its seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 576.14 new cases per day on June 15 to 891.71 new cases per day on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. State data showed hospitalizations are up sharply, increasing by 38% from 637 on the last day of May to 882 on Wednesday. And the situation is even worse in southwest Missouri, where hospitalizations jumped from 134 to 317 over the same period.\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide drought emergency Thursday as more than 92% of Montana faces abnormally dry conditions. \u201cEvery region of the state faces severe to extreme drought conditions, and the situation is getting worse. These alarming drought conditions are devastating our ag producers, challenging our tourism industry, and could bring a severe wildfire season,\u201d Gianforte said in a statement. The declaration directs the state departments of agriculture, livestock, natural resources and conservation to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to secure federal funding to address the fallout from the drought. The order also suspends some regulations for motor vehicles providing drought-related support. A report released by the state Wednesday predicted drought conditions will worsen in the next two months. Drought metrics are significantly worse than they were the same time last year, when just under half of the state confronted similar dryness. Nearly 20% of the state is in extreme drought, up from 14% a week ago, according to figures released Thursday.\nLincoln: Nebraska plans to stop reporting coronavirus numbers online after Wednesday. The state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that it plans to retire the online dashboard that it has used to report statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for more than a year. The current state virus emergency was also set to expire on Wednesday, and along with that, Nebraska is eliminating the last few social distancing guidelines that remained in place. State officials said data on the pandemic will still be available through public records requests, and they said statistics on the spread of the coronavirus are available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of its final update Wednesday, the state had reported 224,488 virus cases and 2,261 deaths linked to COVID-19 since the pandemic began.\nCarson City: Nevada\u2019s minimum wage increased by 75 cents on Thursday to $8.75 an hour for employees who get health benefits and $9.75 an hour for those who do not. The state\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2019 passed a law gradually increasing to the state\u2019s minimum wage to $11 for those with health benefits and $12 for those without by 2024. The first increase was last year.The increase will also raise daily overtime rates starting July 1, except for workers exempt from overtime rules. Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have been pushing to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The federal minimum is $7.25 and has not been raised since 2009.\nPlainfield: A house that was the setting for a monthslong armed standoff in 2007 between a couple and U.S. marshals over tax evasion is back on the market. The 7,500-square-foot former home of Ed and Elaine Brown in Plainfield is listed for $1.59 million, the Valley News reported. The current owners bought the home in 2019 for $315,000 and put in new windows, a redesigned kitchen, hardwood floors, four fireplaces and a steam room, among the upgrades. \u201cSome of the first steps that they took was essentially bringing it back up to livable conditions,\u201d said Lochrane Gary, a real estate agent listing the home. \u201cThey did everything from the ground up.\u201d The Browns were convicted of failing to pay taxes on $1.9 million of income. They declined to appear in court and retreated to the fortress-like home. U.S. marshals arrived; a standoff went on for nearly eight months as anti-tax crusaders and militia groups rallied to the Browns\u2019 cause. The marshals eventually arrested the Browns. Elaine Brown apologized for her actions and was released last year after serving more than 12 years in prison. Ed Brown is expected to serve another 16 years.\nAtlantic City: New Jersey\u2019s yearlong coronavirus-inspired ban on smoking in Atlantic City casinos will end Sunday, just in time for the Fourth of July holiday. Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that an order he signed ending a public health emergency contained a \u201csunset\u201d provision winding down the smoking ban within 30 days, which is Sunday. Although acknowledging gamblers will be free to light up again starting Sunday, the Democratic governor indicated he would look favorably on a measure lawmakers are considering to permanently end smoking in New Jersey\u2019s casinos. \u201cI would be very constructive on that,\u201d he said at a coronavirus briefing, stopping short of saying he would sign the legislation. The governor\u2019s remarks came two hours after dozens of casino workers and anti-smoking advocates rallied on the Atlantic City boardwalk to call for a permanent smoking ban. Casinos are exempted from a state law banning most indoor smoking, and an Atlantic City law limits smoking to no more than 25% of the casino floor.\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico business owners are hopeful as Thursday marked the end of the state\u2019s limits on occupancy rates and other restrictions that the governor had imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. And although the state also ended its color-coded risk system for counties, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state health officials said the campaign to get more people vaccinated will continue. The Democratic governor had set a goal of getting 60% of residents fully vaccinated two weeks before the reopening. That mark was missed but she still opted to lift the restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activities as scheduled. The state now reports about 62% of eligible resident are vaccinated. With the restrictions lifted, all businesses across the state can operate at 100% capacity and all limitations on mass gatherings are gone. Businesses and local governments may still adopt and require additional precautions at their discretion, state officials said.\nNew York City: Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Jennifer Hudson will headline an August concert in Central Park, marking the city\u2019s comeback from the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \u201cIt is going to be a great moment for the city, marking our rebirth, marking our comeback, and it\u2019s going to be one of the greatest Central Park concerts in history,\u201d the mayor said at a virtual news briefing. De Blasio announced last month that producer Clive Davis would recruit an all-star lineup for a Central Park concert in August. No exact date has been announced. More performers will be announced in the coming weeks, de Blasio said. The concert will come 30 years after Simon\u2019s memorable Aug. 15, 1991 Central Park concert, which was recorded and released as a live album and concert film. Springsteen\u2019s return to Broadway last weekend was itself a step in the city\u2019s recovery from the pandemic. \u201cHe is beloved in New York City in an extraordinary way even though he happens to come from New Jersey \u2013 no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d de Blasio said.\nRaleigh: A venomous snake has been captured two days after it was spotted on the loose in a neighborhood of North Carolina\u2019s capital. The Raleigh Police Department sent out a notice late Wednesday announcing that the zebra cobra was found and safely removed from a northwest Raleigh neighborhood. Police didn\u2019t give more details about how or where it was caught. An animal control officer was called Monday to a home where a snake was spotted on a porch, police said. But by the time the officer arrived, the snake had slithered away. Then they learned that a zebra cobra was missing from a home in the area. Officials warned anyone who saw the snake to stay away and call 911, saying it could spit and bite if cornered. WNCN-TV reports that animal control and Raleigh police used wooden boards with special glue on them to trap the snake. It was then moved from the board into a red bucket. Venomous snakes are legal to own in North Carolina, but they must be kept in an escape-proof, bite-proof enclosures and owners must notify law enforcement if one escapes.\nBismarck: An environmental group wary about the sale of North Dakota\u2019s largest coal-fired power plant by a nonprofit Minnesota electric cooperative wants officials in that state to review the deal, saying ratepayers are being left in the dark. Bismarck-based Rainbow Energy Center LLC said it reached an agreement Wednesday to acquire the Coal Creek Station in west-central North Dakota from Maple Grove, Minnesota-based Great River Energy. The acquisition also includes the purchase of associated transmission lines that run from central North Dakota to Minnesota by an affiliate of Rainbow Energy. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. \u201cThis smells like a backroom deal that benefits the North Dakota coal lobby, not regular Minnesotans,\u201d Margaret Levin, director of the Minnesota chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. \u201cIt also sounds like Minnesota customers may remain on the hook for paying for power from this economic loser of a plant for years to come.\u201d Rainbow Energy said the deal still requires state approval of permit transfers and the green light by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates utilities, power generators and pipelines. The Sierra Club, a San Francisco-based group that wants to curb the use of fossil fuels, wants to extend the review to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the state attorney general.\nSandusky: A longtime school resource officer who used a stun gun on two high school students during a self-defense training class has been fired. Perkins Township trustees voted 3-0 on Monday to dismiss Tonya Corbin, who was a resource officer at Perkins High School. She had been on unpaid leave since June 15. Corbin was teaching a self-defense class for female students at the school on May 19 when she brought a stun gun to the class and used it on two students, ages 17 and 18, authorities said. Corbin initially denied using the stun gun, saying she had allowed the students to use it themselves. The two students and a teacher at the school disputed that claim, and Corbin admitted to deploying the stun gun, authorities said. The self-defense class had been provided to students in the past, but this was the first time Corbin was leading it, officials have said.\nOklahoma City: A voter-approved expansion of Medicaid took effect Thursday in Oklahoma after a decade of Republican resistance in a state that has become emblematic of the political struggle to extend the federal health insurance program in conservative strongholds. Oklahoma moved ahead with its expansion at a time when Democrats in Washington and across the states are pressing to complete the work of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, recently upheld by the Supreme Court for the third time in a decade. So far, 38 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, and expansion in a dozen mostly Southern states might be the biggest piece of unfinished business. More than 123,000 low-income people already have been approved for Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma, a state where nearly 15% of the population has been uninsured \u2013 the highest rate in the nation behind Texas, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. State Medicaid officials said they expect that number to increase to more than 200,000 as more people get approved.\nSalem: Firefighters on Wednesday tried to contain a wildfire that burned 10,000 acres near the farming community of Dufur, Oregon. Gov. Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act in response to the fire, allowing the state fire marshal to mobilize firefighters and equipment to help local firefighters. Some 40 personnel, 12 fire engines engines and other resources were on the scene, authorities said. The fire was burning in wheat and brush in the sparsely populated area of north-central Oregon. Firefighters from the Portland area were among those assisting the effort to extinguish the blaze, which ignited Tuesday. The FBI, meanwhile, on Wednesday offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest, and conviction of those responsible for setting a fire on the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation on June 21. The fire burned approximately 42 acres of brush and grass alongside Highway 3 near the reservation fish hatchery in central Oregon. Warm Springs emergency crews battled the blaze. The FBI and the Warm Springs Police Department want anyone with information about the fire to contact them.\nHarrisburg: A Republican-crafted bill to ban COVID-19 \u201cvaccine passports\u201d in some cases and to restrict the health secretary\u2019s actions during health emergencies was vetoed Thursday by Gov. Tom Wolf. The measure split both legislative chambers along party lines last month, and Wolf had said he would veto the proposal. With millions of Pennsylvanians still unvaccinated, many seemingly intent on remaining so, legislative Republicans wanted to prevent what they viewed as stigmatizing policies that require proof of vaccination in violation of health privacy. The bill would have kept colleges and universities that receive state money from mandating proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter buildings, attend class in person or undertake any activity. State and local governmental entities would have been similarly restricted, and governments would not have been allowed to include coronavirus vaccine status on ID cards. It also would have kept the health secretary from ordering closures or directing people who have not been exposed to a contagion to physically distance, wear a mask, quarantine or restrict their travel. The Wolf administration believes the bill, if passed, would have applied to all cases, not just during the current pandemic.\nEast Greenwich: Capt. Regan Keenan was among six Rhode Island National Guard members who were given awards Wednesday for their roles in the Guard's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Rhode Island. The Guard has played an important role in the state's fight against COVID-19. It has run test sites, administered vaccinations and set up field hospitals during the pandemic. At the peak, the Guard had just under 1,000 members activated for COVID-19 response, according to Capt. Mark A. Inzce, a Guard spokesman. The Guard has administered more than 360,000 doses, representing more than 180,000 complete vaccinations, Inzce said. The other recipients were Col. David Ashley, Maj. Joanne Barrett and Staff Sgt. Nicole Mackay of the Air Guard, and Lt. Col. Matthew Edwards and Staff Sgt. Jessica Godena of the Army Guard.\nHilton Head Island: For the first time in 23 years, it won\u2019t cost drivers anything to take the quickest way to the heart of Hilton Head Island. Tolls on the Cross Island Parkway were dropped Thursday after South Carolina made its final bond payment on the $81 million road that opened in 1998. The toll booths will remain up until the Department of Transportation can start a $14 million project to remove them and make other improvements in the coming months. For now, signs are in place reminding drivers to slow in the area. The 7-mile expressway veers off from the only road to the island just after it crosses the Intracoastal Waterway, allowing drivers to avoid a 12-mile route full of stoplights and suburban sprawl. The toll was $1.25 for a passenger car before it was dropped. The state now has only one toll road \u2013 the Southern Connector which connects Interstate 385 to Interstate 85 south of Greenville. That freeway is about 30 years from having its bonds paid off and dropping the tolls.\nAberdeen: A federal judge who charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court over a COVID-19 vaccination dispute removed himself from the case after assigning an in-state attorney to prosecute the proceedings. The chain of events began when state and federal prosecutors declined to handle the case. A retired attorney whom U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann tried to appoint opted out over debate on whether he needed to restart his practice. Kormann than assigned Thomas Fritz, of Rapid City, and recused himself. Kornmann stated in an order filed Tuesday that it\u2019s likely the other federal judges in South Dakota will decline the case as well. If so, the chief judge for the 8th U.S. CIrcuit Court of Appeals will appoint a replacement judge.\nNashville: Transportation officials will briefly shut down a section of the interstate in Nashville with a view of the July Fourth fireworks to prevent onlookers from putting themselves in danger. A news release from the Tennessee Department of Transportation said traffic will be diverted from the eastern portion of the downtown loop to the western portion to avoid illegal pedestrian use of the highway, stopped vehicles and a slowdown of traffic. Vehicles will not be allowed to enter Interstate 24 between Interstate 65 and Interstate 40 from 9 p.m. until 10 p.m. Sunday.\nAustin: Two mosquito trap samples collected in the cities of Granger and Taylor have tested positive for West Nile virus. The positive sample in Granger was taken from a trap site near N. Colorado Street, according to a news release on Thursday from the Williamson County and Cities Health District. The last time a positive sample was collected at this location was June 2, the release said. It said the positive sample in Taylor was taken from a trap site near Murphy Park on Veteran's Drive. This is the first time a positive sample has been collected at this location. The city of Taylor will spray insecticide in a 1-mile vicinity of the positive sample along the street right-of-way and in public parks on Friday and Saturday nights. The chemical used is a pyrethrin-based insecticide, the release said. Pyrethrin is a chemical that can be found in chrysanthemums. Taylor and Granger will do enhanced monitoring and testing, and increase public outreach and education, the release said. It said a West Nile infection might include fever, headache, and body aches, a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph nodes. Those 50 and older and/or with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk for severe symptoms, which might include stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, vision loss, paralysis, and in rare cases, death, the release said.\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox and other local leaders urged state residents to forgo using personal fireworks this summer as the state faces a historic drought. Cox and more than 30 Utah city mayors and council members called on people to instead celebrate July Fourth and Pioneer Day \u2013 a holiday only celebrated in Utah every July 24 \u2013 at public celebrations sponsored by Utah communities. \u201cWith this year\u2019s extremely dry conditions, all it takes is one spark to set off a life-threatening blaze,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe love our great nation and state, but there are much better ways to celebrate our independence and heritage than personal fireworks this year. Please celebrate safely!\u201d Several Utah cities are banning people from setting off their own fireworks this year during the record drought, but many Republicans are against a statewide prohibition. Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Cox, a Republican, has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. Salt Lake City issued a fireworks ban and open burning ban last week, which prohibits people from starting any fires outside.\nMontpelier: A number of walk-in clinics issuing COVID-19 vaccines, including some at Fourth of July celebrations, will be available throughout the weekend, Gov. Phil Scott said. \u201cEven with our state\u2019s high vaccination rate, we still need as many Vermonters as possible to protect themselves from COVID-19 by getting vaccinated,\u201d Scott said in a statement. More than 452,000 of Vermont residents, or 82.1% , have already received at least one dose of vaccine. Venues include a skate park, a church, and a flea market. On Sunday, the holiday, eight pop-up clinics are scheduled throughout the state. The Barton Fairgrounds, the Stowe Independence Day Celebration, and the Champlain Valley Expo are among the clinic sites. Most pharmacies in Vermont are offering walk-in vaccinations, as well.\nAlexandria: Acting U.S. Attorney For the Eastern District of Virginia Raj Parekh announced Thursday the creation of a civil rights unit within the office\u2019s criminal division. Prosecutors assigned to the unit will investigate hate crimes, bias-related incidents, and alleged law enforcement misconduct, among other crimes.\u201cEvery individual has the right to enjoy their lives free from violence or discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other protected basis,\u201d Parekh said in a written statement. The unit\u2019s creation builds on the establishment last year of a civil rights unit that focused primarily on civil matters related to the rights of military service members and those with disabilities. Parekh said the unit\u2019s creation is also in line with mandates from Attorney General Merrick Garland to respond more vigorously to allegations of hate crimes and other bias-related incidents. The Eastern District of Virginia is headquartered in Alexandria and has offices in Richmond, Newport News and Norfolk.\nSpokane: The rolling blackouts that cut electricity for tens of thousands of Spokane residents amid this week\u2019s record-breaking heat wave mostly hit the same power customers repeatedly because of strains on equipment that couldn\u2019t handle the blistering temperatures, utility officials said. And there was plenty of power available for customers in Spokane despite increased demand. That\u2019s in contrast to the blackouts imposed in Texas last winter amid freezing temperatures, when there wasn\u2019t enough electricity to meet the demand, and during a hot spell in California last summer. In Spokane, Avita Utilities officials blamed lack of transmission capacity combined with heat strain on equipment for their decision to impose the blackouts as the city\u2019s 217,000 people endured sweltering heat that hit a record of 109 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday. Some people in the city never had their power cut while those unlucky enough to live in neighborhoods with equipment affected by the heat were targeted with blackouts that hit some repeatedly, said Heather Rosentrater, Avista\u2019s senior vice president for energy delivery. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to spread where those outages are occurring across different customers,\u201d she said.\nCarrollton: A covered bridge that\u2019s on the National Register of Historic Places might soon be restored to repair damage caused by a fire in 2017. The Carrollton Covered Bridge in Barbour County had much of its outer covering destroyed in the fire, which was determined to be arson, the state Transportation Department said. The basic structure was left mostly intact. The state reopened the bridge to traffic after minor repairs were made following the fire, and it was decided last fall that the Division of Highways could do the restoration work. Tiger Diversified LLC in Upshur County was awarded a contract in May for the timber for the project. The state received a bid of $400,000 last week for the scaffolding and rigging system, the Transportation Department said. Restoration work could begin quickly if the bid is accepted, District 7 Engineer Brian Cooper said in a news release. The 140-foot-long bridge was built in 1856 and crosses the Buckhannon River near Carrollton.\nMadison: Wisconsin environmental officials have given the city of Waukesha final approval to withdraw water from Lake Michigan. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources announced Thursday it issued final approval for the withdraw on Wednesday. The city is expected to start pulling water from the lake in 2023. The city asked regulators in 2010 for permission to divert up to 8.2 million gallons from the lake daily for public use because city wells are contaminated with radium and return treated wastewater to the lake. The request triggered a lengthy review process under the Great Lakes Compact, an agreement between eight Great Lakes states that controls the use of lake water. The Compact Council approved the request in 2016.\nCasper: A Wyoming man killed himself after authorities began searching his property for a woman missing since 2017. Authorities started searching the Sublette County property of Darrell \u201cPete\u201d Petry on June 19, seeking evidence related to the disappearance of Vanessa \u201cNessy\u201d Orren, 61, of LaBarge. Petry left the property on the second day of the search and was later found dead, Sublette County sheriff\u2019s officials said in a statement Wednesday. Investigators determined Petry died by suicide. Sheriff\u2019s spokesman Sgt. Travis Bingham declined to release more details because the case was still under investigation, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t under arrest at the time,\u201d Bingham said. \u201cHe was still free to come and go.\u201d Orren\u2019s disappearance was still being investigated and anyone with information should call investigators at (307) 367-4378, sheriff\u2019s officials said."

                    "value": "Montgomery: Teachers and public school employees are retiring at the highest levels seen in nearly a decade, state records show. More than 3,500 Alabama employees in the field retired in the most recent period tracked, Al.com reports. That\u2019s the most since the 2010-11 school year, when just under 4,100 employees retired after changes to the state\u2019s retirement benefits. The numbers are from Alabama\u2019s Teacher Retirement System. The large number of employees retiring is likely due to pandemic stresses, Roanoke City Schools Superintendent Chuck Marcum said.\nMeadow Lakes: Numerous residents of this Anchorage suburb want officials to deny a permit for a proposed gravel pit, arguing the mine doesn\u2019t belong in a residential area and raising concerns about road safety and decimated property values. Quality Asphalt Paving and parent company Colaska Inc., part of the international Colas Group, have proposed the gravel pit for 160 forested acres in Meadow Lakes, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. Notices went out to more than 270 landowners within a half-mile of the site in mid-May, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The site is bounded by residential properties on three sides and a mix of commercial and residential on the fourth. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Planning Commission will conduct a public hearing on Colaska\u2019s application for a conditional use permit July 19. There are already more than 100 active permitted pits across the borough. Matanuska-Susitna generally has few, if any, zoning laws that prohibit industrial operations like gravel pits in neighborhoods. At most, there could be 500 trucks making 1,000 daily trips to and from the pit, though the application indicates that\u2019s not an average or constant number. Some residents say Sylvan Road, already crumbling in places, can\u2019t handle up to 1,000 truck trips a day.\nMesa: Residents are being asked to conserve energy this summer, city officials said. The city of Mesa does not own or operate any electric generators and purchases its electric supply through various short- and long-term agreements. This year, supply costs have increased dramatically because of the region\u2019s population growth and the transition to newer and cleaner energy production, city officials said. Residents are being asked to set thermostats at 78 degrees Fahrenheit during the peak hours of 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. or when not at home. Authorities said setting the air conditioner 5 degrees higher could save up to 20% on cooling costs. Mesa also is working to reduce peak electrical usage at city facilities while also developing programs for customers to save energy and money while reducing demand during peak hours.\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday reported 1,246 new coronavirus cases and 23 more hospitalizations from the past three days as Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that Arkansas could face a \u201ctough week\u201d in the virus\u2019s growth. The Department of Health said the biggest jump over the weekend came Saturday, when the state added 764 new cases. The department recently stopped reporting daily COVID-19 numbers on weekends, releasing the figures on Mondays instead. The department said there were 361 people hospitalized because of COVID-19. The department reported COVID-19 deaths rose by seven to 5,920 since the pandemic began. Hutchinson noted that the state has now surpassed 1 million people fully vaccinated. \u201cThis is a milestone, but we need to pick up the pace before school starts this fall,\u201d the Republican governor tweeted. \u201cThis could be a tough week in new cases and hospitalizations, so get the shot now.\u201d Arkansas has had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Forty-two percent of the state\u2019s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 34.5% of residents have completed their vaccinations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBorrego Springs: An annual count of bighorn sheep scheduled for this past weekend in a Southern California desert was canceled after a volunteer died while preparing for the excursion amid scorching heat, according to a newspaper report Sunday. The tally in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park dates back 50 years and is one of the longest-running citizen-science projects in the country, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. It typically draws dozens of volunteers who spend three days collecting information for scientists monitoring the health of bighorn sheep, which have been on the federal endangered species list since the late 1990s. Don White, a 68-year-old nature enthusiast from Culver City, had participated in the past and this year was assigned a spot in Borrego Palm Canyon that requires a 4-mile hike in over and around boulders. An experienced backpacker, White had counted there before. Two weeks ago, he and a colleague decided to hike in with bottled water and leave it there for the count. Coming back from the canyon just after noon June 19, not far from the trailhead, White collapsed and died, the Union-Tribune reports. His colleague was hospitalized briefly, as was a firefighter who came to assist them. It was 116 degrees Fahrenheit in Anza-Borrego that day. After last year\u2019s count was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 tally had drawn so much interest that there was a waiting list, according to the newspaper.\nDenver: More than 70% of adults in the state have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, meeting the July Fourth goal set by President Joe Biden. However, most of the state\u2019s 64 counties have not come close to that mark. As of Sunday, only 12 Colorado counties had vaccinated at least 70% of people eligible to be inoculated, KUSA-TV reports. Forty-five percent of counties had vaccinated less than half of the eligible population with at least one dose. While the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has become the dominant strain in Colorado, the number of people testing positive for the virus is down. Hospitalizations are also decreasing but are higher than during lulls last year.\nHartford: The state has unveiled a new website to provide up-to-date information on the rollout of legalized cannabis, ranging from basic information about the law that took effect July 1 to resources for prospective marijuana-related businesses. While portions of the new law have taken effect, including making it legal for individuals age 21 and older to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of \u201ccannabis plant material,\u201d several key parts of the legislation don\u2019t begin for another year or two. The establishment of retail stores, for example, isn\u2019t expected until the end of 2022. \u201cThis new website will be an important resource for consumers and interested business owners,\u201d Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle H. Seagull said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to provide information about the licensing and application process as it becomes available, and we are committed to a clear and transparent process.\u201d People can find the website at ct.gov/cannabis. State officials are encouraging residents to check the site regularly for updates on various provisions of the new, wide-ranging law, including the Social Equity Council, which will oversee the verification of \u201cequity applicants\u201d for marijuana-related licenses.\nRehoboth Beach: A boardwalk beef has been brewing over a no-ketchup policy at a popular french fry stand. Regular visitors to the town\u2019s three popular Thrasher\u2019s French Fries establishments know better than to ask for ketchup. Piping hot fries, cooked in peanut oil, are famously served with only salt and apple cider vinegar \u2013 no ketchup, not ever. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been since the concession stand was founded on the Ocean City, Maryland, boardwalk in 1929, and there are no plans to deviate from this Eastern Shore tradition. But not all tourists know or even care about Thrasher\u2019s history. They just want ketchup. And that has sparked something of a condiment clash with some neighboring businesses, particularly Gus & Gus Place. The iconic eatery offering burgers, fried chicken and corn dogs on Rehoboth\u2019s mile-long boardwalk since 1956 won\u2019t give away or even sell the condiment to non-customers. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped nearby Thrasher\u2019s patrons from demanding ketchup, trying to sneak squirts from Gus & Gus\u2019s ketchup bottles or attempting to walk off with packets. It\u2019s become such a problem that the cash-only, family-owned business put up a sign near the counter: \u201cKetchup is for Gus & Gus food only. No exceptions!\u201d It hasn\u2019t worked. \u201cPeople pretty much cuss at us a lot,\u201d said Bill Svolis, 47, who has grown up in the business founded in 1956 by his father, Gus. \u201cIt happens almost every day.\u201d Police have even been called to help deal with belligerent customers.\nWashington: The newest member of the U.S. Capitol Police force is Lila, a 2-year-old black Labrador retriever recruited to help troubled and stressed officers, WUSA-TV reports. The pup couldn\u2019t quite make the cut as a guide dog for the visually impaired. \u201cPoor Lila is a little bit of a sensitive soul, so asking her to do that guide work \u2013 even though she could \u2013 you can definitely see that it was a difficult task for her,\u201d said Guide Dogs of the Desert training director Michal Anna Padilla. U.S. Capitol Police has lost three officers in 2021 in what the force officially considers \u201cline of duty\u201d deaths: Brian Sicknick, who suffered a stroke the day after confronting rioters at the Capitol in January; Howard Liebengood, who died from suicide days after confronting the insurrectionists; and William Evans, whom a driver pinner with a vehicle while ramming a barricade April 4, according to Capitol Police. Lila arrived from Palm Springs, California, on the Fourth of July, getting pet by passengers who heard the announcement of her new assignment. On her first full day in town Monday, Lila played the role of tourist as she walked around the Capitol grounds. Her \u201coffice\u201d will be at the Capitol Police headquarters a block away.\nPanama City Beach: There\u2019s really no way to know if condos across the city are slowly sinking into the sand, experts say. About a week after Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida, partially collapsed, leaving dozens and more than 100 others missing, local officials said condos in Bay County are not required to inspect height or track changes over time. While it remains unknown exactly what caused the Miami-area condo to crumble, some believe the collapse is linked to the fact that the building was sinking about 2 millimeters per year. \u201cThere\u2019s always a worry,\u201d Mark McWaters, building inspector for Panama City Beach, said of the possibility for a local collapse. \u201cThings are man-made, they\u2019re not perfect, and so there could be a flaw in something that\u2019s not seen. If something is seen, we will address it.\u201d According to information provided by the Bay County Property Appraiser\u2019s office, there are almost 390 active condominiums in Bay County. About 135 are high-rises, which boast five or more stories, that were built between 1965 and 2020. Almost 20 are as old as or older than Champlain Towers South, which was constructed in 1981. David Jordan, division chief of fire inspection for Panama City Beach Fire Rescue, said he believes the collapse in Miami sparked a need for steeper regulations.\nPlains: The longest-married presidential couple in American history are celebrating 75 years since they tied the knot. As a young midshipman, Jimmy Carter needed a date one evening while he was home from the U.S. Naval Academy, so his younger sister paired him with a family friend who already had a crush. Nearly eight decades later, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter are still together in the same tiny town where they were born, grew up and had that first outing. In between, they\u2019ve traveled the world as Naval officer and military spouse, as American president and first lady, and finally as human rights and public health ambassadors. \u201cIt\u2019s a full partnership,\u201d the 39th president told the Associated Press during a joint interview ahead of the couple\u2019s 75th wedding anniversary Wednesday. Carter, 96, has said often since leaving the Oval Office in 1981 that the most important decision he ever made wasn\u2019t as head of state, commander in chief, or even executive officer of a nuclear submarine in the early years of the Cold War. Rather, it was falling for Eleanor Rosalynn Smith in 1945 and marrying her the following summer. \u201cMy biggest secret is to marry the right person if you want to have a long-lasting marriage,\u201d he said. The nonagenarians \u2013 she\u2019s now 93 \u2013 offered a few other tips for an enduring bond, including communication, reconciliation and finding common interests. They read the Bible together aloud each night, something they\u2019ve done for years, even when separated by their travels. And \u201ceach (person) should have some space,\u201d the former first lady said. \u201cThat\u2019s really important.\u201d\nHonolulu: For nearly a year, Maui residents had their tropical oasis virtually to themselves. Then the visitors all came flooding back. \u201cOver-tourism\u201d has long been a complaint of locals on the island that is among the world\u2019s most popular getaways: congested roads, crowded beaches, packed restaurants. But as the U.S. begins to emerge from the pandemic, Maui is reeling from some of the same strains seen on the mainland, like a shortage of hospitality workers. And its restaurants, still operating at limited capacity, are struggling to keep up. Now, as cooped-up mainlanders return in droves, Maui officials are making an unusual plea to airlines: Please don\u2019t bring so many people to our island. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the authority to say stop, but we are asking the powers to be to help us,\u201d Mayor Michael Victorino said at a recent news conference. Hawaii has had some of the nation\u2019s most stringent coronavirus public health restrictions, and it\u2019s the only state that hasn\u2019t fully reopened, in part due to its remote location and limited hospitals. Also high on people\u2019s minds is the memory of diseases that wiped out 80% of the Native Hawaiian population in the century after Europeans arrived. The governor doesn\u2019t plan on lifting all restrictions until 70% of the state\u2019s population is vaccinated. As of Friday, just 58% of residents were.\nBoise: U.S. officials and a sheep industry group have filed notices to appeal a federal court ruling involving an eastern Idaho sheep research facility long targeted by environmental groups concerned about the potential harm to grizzly bears and other wildlife. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and American Sheep Industry Association filed the notices late last month to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A judge\u2019s ruling in April prevents grazing in significant areas used by the Agriculture Department\u2019s U.S. Sheep Experiment Station. Grazing was suspended in 2013 following previous lawsuits by environmental groups contending the areas contain key wildlife habitat that is a corridor for grizzly bears between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. Conservation groups contend grizzly bears have been killed because of sheep station activities. The groups also say bighorn sheep, which can acquire deadly diseases from domestic sheep, and greater sage grouse use the area. Grazing resumed following the release of a 2017 environmental impact statement considering the effects of sheep grazing on wildlife. The sheep station, operated by the Agriculture Department\u2019s Agricultural Research Service, supports research using domestic sheep owned by the University of Idaho, some involving grazing at higher altitudes.\nSpringfield: The Illinois Department of Transportation is accepting applications for projects to improve public transit systems outside Chicago. IDOT said last week that the Rebuild Illinois capital construction program will pay for this round of projects totaling $110 million. Projects must expand and upgrade service, increase options and improve quality of life. Applications for the transit capital grant program are due Aug. 31. A total of $355 million is targeted for competitive construction grants for transit programs outside Chicago. Thus far, the program has renovated bus stations and passenger information kiosks for the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District and built a new transportation center in downtown Bloomington. Jacksonville received a facility to serve as headquarters, for training and dispatch. IDOT maintains \u201cPublic Transportation Providers\u201d information online. Eligible recipients will be invited to a July 14 webinar to address specific questions and review the application process.\nIndianapolis: A judge has sided with the governor in a dispute between top state Republicans over whether he can proceed with a lawsuit challenging the increased power state legislators gave themselves to intervene during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The Marion County judge\u2019s ruling rejects arguments from Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is allowed under the Indiana Constitution, despite GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb\u2019s objections. Judge Patrick Dietrick wrote in the ruling dated Saturday that such an interpretation would give the attorney general greater power than Holcomb as head of the state\u2019s executive branch in protecting the governor\u2019s constitutional powers. \u201cThis is an absurd result that could not have been intended by either the drafters of Indiana\u2019s Constitution or the General Assembly,\u201d Dietrick said. Holcomb\u2019s lawsuit argues that the law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative \u201cemergency session\u201d during statewide emergencies declared by the governor.\nAltoona: The father of an 11-year-old boy who died following an accident on a popular boat ride at an amusement park said his son and other family members were trapped by the ride\u2019s seat belts when the boat carrying them flipped. In an interview broadcast Tuesday on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d David Jaramillo recounted what happened when the boat capsized Saturday night on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona. \u201cWhen it flipped over, all of us were trapped in the safety seat belts,\u201d he said. \u201cI see the silhouettes of my sons trying to grab each other, grab us. They want us to help them. We couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Michael Jaramillo died Sunday from his injuries, and the morning news program reported his older brother was hospitalized in critical condition in a medically induced coma. Two other riders who were also family members suffered injuries. \u201cI feel like Adventureland robbed me of my baby,\u201d said Sabrina Jaramillo, Michael\u2019s mother. \u201cI will never get a chance to see him grow up.\u201d The ride uses a conveyor belt to move large circular rafts through rapids. After the boat carrying six people overturned, emergency responders and witnesses helped to free the riders. The cause of the accident \u2013 the second deadly incident on the ride in five years \u2013 is under investigation.\nTopeka: About 600 workers are on strike at the Frito-Lay plant in the city after union workers rejected a proposed contract that had been recommended by union leadership. Workers said the main points of contention are small pay increases and employees being forced to work hours of overtime. The workers are represented by Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union, which recommended a proposed two-year contract after months of negotiations. Workers voted Friday and Saturday to reject the contract, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Frito-Lay is one of seven divisions of Harrison, New York-based PepsiCo. The company said in a statement that because the union leadership recommended the contract, it does not anticipate any further negotiations \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d PepsiCo said the plant would continue to operate, and it had a plan to ensure employee safety.\nLouisville: As Fourth of July fireworks sent pets around the city into hiding, several volunteers spent the evening comforting animals at the Kentucky Humane Society. Fireworks have been a Fourth of July tradition since the United States first celebrated the anniversary of its Independence Day in 1777, and every year millions of cats and dogs panic in confusion from the loud bangs. While there are several recommended steps to help four-legged friends get through the traumatic night, not all animals have a family to keep them safe. To help some of those animals, multiple volunteers spent time with dogs and cats at the Kentucky Humane Society on Sunday to make sure they were comfortable and relaxed. \u201cVolunteers distributed special treats and read children\u2019s books to the animals to distract them,\u201d the nonprofit wrote on its Facebook page. \u201cMany pets fell fast asleep on their beds \u2013 some were even snoring!\u201d Pets\u2019 dislike of fireworks is a result of their advanced hearing capabilities. Nadine Znajda, a veterinary dermatologist from BluePearl Pet Hospital, said part of pets\u2019 sensitivity to sound stems from their wide range of hearing. For dogs, who can perceive both audible and vibrational sounds, hearing is full-body sensory experience, Znajda said.\nBaton Rouge: Ballots have gone out for state lawmakers to decide whether to hold a historic veto override session, with heavy pressure pouring in from outside groups trying to sway that decision and a heated debate taking shape on social media. Gov. John Bel Edwards rejected 28 bills from the regular session and struck out a handful of legislative pet projects from budget bills. The Louisiana Constitution calls for a veto session to be automatically scheduled when a governor jettisons legislation. However, a majority vote of either the House or Senate can scrap the gathering \u2013 a decision that often is an afterthought for lawmakers who have canceled every veto session since the modern constitution was enacted in 1974. But this time appears different, with two bills in particular drawing interest for a mid-July veto session from the majority-Republican House and Senate: a measure banning transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender and legislation allowing people 21 and older to carry a concealed handgun without needing a permit. Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder said he supports the veto session, as does House GOP leader Blake Miguez. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we could avoid one,\u201d said Houma Rep. Tanner Magee, the House\u2019s second-ranking Republican.\nPortland: State officials have launched a new tool to help people who believe they spotted a white shark find out if it was indeed the big fish. The Maine Department of Marine Resources has added the online tool to its website with a form that allows shark spotters to upload photos and videos and submit a description of what they saw. People often mistake ocean sunfish, basking sharks and other harmless animals for white sharks, said Erin Summers, the director of the marine department\u2019s biological monitoring division. She said the online tool will \u201chelp people gain a better understanding of the species found in the Gulf of Maine.\u201d Scientists with the marine department will review the information when they receive it and might request more information. White sharks, also called great whites, aren\u2019t common in Maine, but they can occur in the state\u2019s waters. A white shark bite killed Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, last summer when she was swimming off Bailey Island. Interest in the species has increased in the state since.\nBaltimore: The state\u2019s highest court has upheld a lower court\u2019s emergency order keeping Maryland enrolled in enhanced federal unemployment programs. News outlets report that Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera on Monday dismissed Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s attempt to block the 10-day temporary restraining order issued a Baltimore judge issued Saturday. Unemployed residents will continue to receive federal unemployment benefits, including supplemental $300 weekly payments, through at least July 13. The Court of Special Appeals, the state\u2019s second-highest court, had rejected an appeal from Hogan and the state\u2019s Department of Labor on Saturday evening. The parties will return to Baltimore Circuit Court on Friday for a hearing on the matter and continue on Monday, if necessary. Hogan\u2019s administration had planned to cut off the benefits over the weekend, ahead of their expiration in September. Other states with Republican governors have taken similar steps. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that ending the benefits early would cut off a lifeline for struggling families. Hogan has said ending the benefits will help get people into jobs.\nSalem: The Peabody Essex Museum is offering vaccination clinics and expanding its hours as the coronavirus pandemic eases in the state, museum officials announced Tuesday. The new, expanded hours kick off Friday, when the Salem museum holds the first of several COVID-19 vaccination clinics. The clinics, in partnership with Curative, will offer Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson shots at no cost on Fridays from 4 to 7 p.m. through Aug. 13. Visitors who get a shot also get free admission and will be entered into the state\u2019s vaccine lottery with a chance to win either $1 million or a $300,000 college scholarship. The museum has also lifted its mask mandate for staff and visitors in accordance with public health recommendations and will soon resume historic house and gallery tours. Enhanced sanitation and disinfection efforts will continue. The museum closed in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic and reopened with limited hours last summer. \u201cWe have much in store this summer with hybrid virtual and live programs, new exhibitions, and a renewed sense of gratitude for being able to celebrate creativity and connection,\u201d Robert Monk, the museum\u2019s interim chief operating officer, said in a statement.\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday called for allotting $150 million in federal coronavirus rescue funds for the state\u2019s local parks and trails \u2013 the second time she has proposed major recreation spending in less than a month. The proposal, if approved by lawmakers, would authorize the state to disburse grants to applicants. The governor said the spending on parks and recreation would boost tourism, particularly aiding seasonal and rural economies, and help sectors disproportionately hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cRight now this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make transformative investment in our outdoors spaces, and we ought to take it,\u201d she said during a news conference at Connor Bayou Park in Grand Haven. The money could be used to make parks more accessible and to build playgrounds, basketball courts, pavilions and boardwalks, Whitmer said. It also could improve regional trail systems, including in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Ottawa County and St. Clair County. The Democratic governor last month proposed allocating $250 million of $6.5 billion in discretionary federal COVID-19 funding to state parks. She also has called for using the aid to expand a tuition-free program, help businesses temporarily pay at least $15 an hour, and give front-line workers \u201chero pay\u201d bonuses.\nSt. Paul: Foresters and landowners are concerned that a disease that kills oak trees is creeping farther north in the state. The mighty oak is one of the most abundant trees in Minnesota. Oak wilt was been around for decades and has been confirmed in 40 of the state\u2019s counties. But the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is now finding cases farther north than ever before, most recently in Crow Wing County, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. \u201cI consider oak wilt to be really one of the top forest health issues in this part of the state, in particular because we have so many red and pin oaks up in this area,\u201d said Rachael Dube, a DNR forest health specialist in Brainerd. Dube counted 40 oak trees around her home in Brainerd, less than 10 miles from where oak wilt was recently confirmed. \u201cI talked with people not only that have had (trees with) oak wilt but are concerned about getting it. And it\u2019s an issue that people are starting to become really passionate about in the area,\u201d Dube said. The non-native disease slowly kills the leaves of an oak tree and, eventually, the tree itself. It spreads through its root systems and through open tree pores. People accelerate the spread when they prune oaks and carry infected firewood across the state, foresters said.\nJackson: The nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert says despite being fully vaccinated against COVID-19, if he were in the country\u2019s least-vaccinated state, he\u2019d don a face mask. Along with the Magnolia State\u2019s fully vaccinated rate of 31%, falling far behind the nation\u2019s average of 47%, Dr. Anthony Fauci is concerned about the rapidly spreading delta variant of the coronavirus. \u201cI might want to go the extra mile to be cautious enough to be sure that I get the extra added layer of protection, even though the vaccines themselves are highly effective,\u201d Fauci told Chuck Todd during NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The delta variant has quickly gained prominence in the U.S., making up 10% of new COVID-19 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Federal health officials have noted available vaccines are effective against the delta variant, but as Fauci put it, \u201cnothing is 100%.\u201d Since Gov. Tate Reeves lifted Mississippi\u2019s county-by-county mask mandates in March, daily COVID-19 cases had been on the decline. But within the past two weeks, the state health department\u2019s public database shows cases rising again. \u201cIt feels very reminiscent of where we were in an early part of the pandemic,\u201d State Epidemiologist Paul Byers said last week. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in the same situation now with the delta variant.\u201d\nNixa: As the coronavirus surges in the state, a mayor who imposed a mask requirement and other public safety measures is facing a recall vote, even though the requirements have long since expired. Nixa voters will have the option to recall Mayor Brian Steele at a special election set for Nov. 2. Steele, who was delegated emergency powers by the City Council to deal with the pandemic, enacted the mask ordinance in October and ended it April 30. The petition said Steele should be recalled for \u201cindividually and without regard to the citizens of Nixa, nor the vote of city council, enacting a mask mandate, and taking other actions detrimental to the city of Nixa, its economy and the health and welfare of the community in general.\u201d Nixa, which has about 21,000 residents, is located about 10 miles south of Springfield, where hospitals are overflowing with COVID-19 patients, leading to a shortage of ventilators. Health officials are blaming low vaccination rates and the delta variant of the coronavirus for the surge. Just 44.8% of the state\u2019s residents have received at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared to 54.9% nationally. And the rate is even lower in southwest Missouri. Christian County, where Nixa is located, has a vaccine rate of 35.2%. Some nearby counties have rates in the teens.\nCrow Agency: The warriors and their galloping horses kicked up dust as they circled the field to finish off the last of Gen. George Armstrong Custer\u2019s men as onlookers watched during the Battle of Little Bighorn reenactment late last month. \u201cThis has been one of our most successful days; it was a gift,\u201d organizer Jimmy Real Bird said in an interview with The Billings Gazette. \u201cThe land brings people out. It is like a breath of fresh air to see its history.\u201d The reenactment, which took place on the 145th anniversary of Custer\u2019s Last Stand, is a part of the annual Crow Native Days, a celebration that attracts thousands of people from across the country to see rodeos, reenactment and more around Crow Agency. The festival, sidelined last year due to COVID-19, is giving a much-needed boost to the morale and local economy of the area. \u201cToday is a good day to be here; today is a good day to be Crow,\u201d Chairman Frank White Clay said during an address to veterans June 25. White Clay noted that the tribe has had struggles with the pandemic. It halted any chance of meeting in person for over a year while also killing tribal members at a higher rate than the Montana average. Those dark days, he said, have passed. The warriors consisted of young Crow Tribe riders who played braves from the Crow, Sioux and Cheyenne tribes.\nNorfolk: A former Junior Miss Nebraska is hoping the blankets she made will provide comfort and warmth to children who may be experiencing difficulties in their lives. Megan Olson\u2019s project began last December when the 21-year-old made fleece blankets for several friends, the Norfolk Daily News reports. \u201cIt became an obsession,\u201d said the 21-year-old, who is studying to be a veterinary technician at Northeast Community College in Norfolk. The blankets are made from two layers of fleece that are fringed around the edges. The top and bottom strips are knotted together, which keeps the two layers in place. Olson was drawn to the project for a number of reasons. \u201cI wanted to make something useful,\u201d she told the Daily News. The blankets also brought back memories. \u201cI remembered one of the blankets I had as a child when I broke my arm,\u201d she said. Olson recently donated 12 blankets to Project Linus through Tara Brtek, a counselor at Washington Elementary School in Norfolk. Project Linus, which donates new blankets to children in need, is named for the character by the same name in the Peanuts cartoon who carries a blanket everywhere he goes. Olson said some of the blankets she made will be used by students at the school, while others may be given to students to take home.\nLas Vegas: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is proposing rounding up more than 500 wild burros in the desert north of Lake Mead. The feral donkeys are stripping the land of vegetation and could die off if the population isn\u2019t managed along the Arizona-Nevada line, the agency said. It wants to gather most of them to offer up for adoption. If the plan is approved, the government also plans to temporarily sterilize other burros and round up the animals at other points over the next decade, the Las Vegas Sun reports. No date for the roundup has been set. It could be years away or as early as this fall if a historic drought in the West dries up enough plants and grass to force starvation conditions, agency documents indicate. The proposal also includes removing a small herd of wild horses in the same area. The Bureau of Land Management estimates at least 554 burros and 36 horses live in the Lake Mead Complex, an expanse of rangeland covering about 291 square miles. It\u2019s one of the biggest herds in Nevada. The agency manages the complex along with the National Park Service. The area can support up to 98 burros and no horses, Bureau of Land Management officials said. The animals reproduce exponentially and have few predators, and their demands mean food and water sources aren\u2019t sustainable, according to the agency.\nConcord: Up to 2,000 Dartmouth-Hitchcock employees will keep working remotely in some capacity after the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. Brenda Blair of Dartmouth-Hitchcock told the Valley News that positions will be affected at least part of the time in human resources, information technology, finance and clinical secretary services. The total includes about 13% of the health system\u2019s employees overall and almost 20% of workers at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon. \u201cIt is increasing our ability to recruit and retain our staff,\u201d Blair said. \u201cWe are employing workers outside of Vermont and New Hampshire.\u201d She characterized the current shift as one from \u201cremote by necessity,\u201d which the health system adopted in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, to \u201cremote by design,\u201d in which Dartmouth-Hitchcock has taken the time to think through how best to approach remote work. Blair said some employees will work from home full time, while others will rotate in-person days with other co-workers.\nWildwood: The state has set aside $4 million in its recently enacted budget for long-needed repairs to the Wildwood boardwalk, one of the Jersey Shore\u2019s main attractions. But city officials say the walkway needs work that could cost $60 million. Gov. Phil Murphy visited the resort town Sunday to describe the aid and meet with local officials, the Press of Atlantic City reports. \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic boardwalk, by any measure,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s America\u2019s boardwalk, and the extent to which we get this thing rebuilt properly has a huge positive impact on the boardwalk, on the businesses on the boardwalk (and) on tourism.\u201d The Democratic governor had visited the walkway in April 2020 after a storm damaged sections of the boardwalk near the Convention Center. But before that storm hit, city officials had said the walkway was overdue for an overhaul. Mayor Pete Byron told the newspaper that the total cost of the work could reach $60 million but that Wildwood had come up with a partial plan that would cost $35 million. The newspaper said Murphy did not address a question about his veto of a $56 million earmark for the Wildwood boardwalk in 2019.\nSanta Fe: The city is tapping into federal grant money and other funding to pilot an initiative aimed at getting more children to ride their bicycles and walk to school. Students at Nina Otero Community School and El Camino Real Academy in Santa Fe are among those receiving bike safety lessons this summer as part of the citywide effort, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. A $300,000 grant and matching money from the Santa Fe Metropolitan Planning Organization will pay for staffing and a consultant, who will help build staff and volunteer groups to keep bike safety a top priority. Funding will also be spent on experts in fields like geographic information systems so recommendations can be made on improvements to trails, sidewalks and crosswalks around town. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking into improvements on campus areas,\u201d said Tim Rogers, Conservation Trust trails program manager and Safe Routes coordinator. \u201cWe have all been working primarily on the south side.\u201d Safe Routes to School initiatives span the nation, emphasizing pedestrian and bike safety for kids getting to school. Rogers said a Safe Routes program in Las Cruces is possibly the only comprehensive program in the state. A 2015 study showed the longer Safe Routes initiatives were in place, the more kids started walking and biking to schools.\nNew York: The city that never sleeps could live up to its name under an agency\u2019s proposal for 24-hour entertainment districts where revelers can party all night. The city\u2019s Office of Nightlife is recommending that officials identify areas with low residential density \u201cwhere a limited 24-hour program might be tested.\u201d The recommendation is contained in a 160-page report issued this month by the nightlife office. \u201cCities around the world are expanding the way institutions and businesses can operate at night, as limitations on closing hours have pushed latenight activity to unlicensed venues, sometimes coming into conflict with residential uses,\u201d the report says. \u201cUniform closing hours for nightlife businesses can result in groups of people congregating in the street, elevating tensions between patrons and residents.\u201d The report notes that Amsterdam began allowing nightlife venues to apply for 24-hour licenses in 2012, \u201cdeveloping strict criteria for potential applicants that included cultural significance, accessibility to public transportation, and locations without \u2018inconvenience to local residents.\u2019 \u201d New York City\u2019s Office of Nightlife, part of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, was created in 2017 to serve as a liaison between nightlife operators and city enforcement agencies.\nCorolla: A new museum will house wooden boats that plied the Currituck Sound when world-class duck hunting and bass fishing were livelihoods for local watermen and passions for the wealthy. The 10,000 square-foot, $4.3 million Currituck Maritime Museum in the shadow of the Currituck Beach Lighthouse is set to open next week, The Virginian-Pilot reports. \u201cIt tells of a way of life that\u2019s not around anymore,\u201d said Currituck County native Wilson Snowden. Currituck is a Native American word meaning \u201cland of the wild goose.\u201d For about a century from the mid-1800s, the Currituck Sound was renowned for duck hunting when millions of waterfowl wintered there. In the mid-20th century, the sound also was known for excellent largemouth bass fishing. The bounty created industries that served as the beginning of tourism in the area. Plush hunt clubs sprung up along the sound to meet the demand of wealthy industrialists who came to hunt and fish and hired locals to guide them. Men became experts at building boats and carving decoys. Before federal law prohibited market duck hunting in the early 1900s, watermen would shoot hundreds and sell them to be shipped to restaurants. A single canvasback duck sold for $6 in 1900, equal to $157 in today\u2019s money, according to a museum exhibit.\nBismarck: About 125 soldiers from a National Guard unit based in the city will be sent to the U.S. border with Mexico later this year for an undetermined amount of time, the North Dakota Guard said Tuesday. The soldiers from the 957th Engineer Company are expected to begin the deployment this fall, the military said. Mike Nowatzki, a spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum, said the Department of the Army made the request through the National Guard Bureau. \u201cWe have monitored the ongoing crisis at the southern border and have responded to the request by sending North Dakota National Guard Soldiers to support the efforts to secure our border,\u201d the Republican governor said in a statement. Nowatzki said the deployment is being funded by the federal government. Burgum is among a growing list of Republican governors promising to send law enforcement officers to Texas. Heads of state from Arkansas, Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have all committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. In South Dakota, a billionaire Republican donor is paying $1 million to help defray the cost. Nowatzki said he was not aware of any private donors who had offered to offset the cost of the deployment of North Dakota National Guard troops.\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it would not consider an appeal over the firing of a white police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice outside a Cleveland recreation center in 2014. The appeal was filed in April by the Cleveland Police Patrolment\u2019s Association on behalf former Officer Timothy Loehmann. Cleveland fired Loehmann in 2017 not for killing Tamir, who was Black, but for providing false information on his job application. An arbitrator and a county judge upheld his firing. A state appellate court earlier this year dismissed Loehmann\u2019s appeal, citing the union\u2019s failure to serve notice on outside attorneys hired by the city. Loehmann, a rookie, shot Tamir within seconds of a cruiser skidding to a stop near a gazebo where the child had been sitting. Officers responded to a call from a man who said someone was waving a gun around. The man also told a dispatcher that the gun could be a fake and that the person might be a juvenile. A state grand jury declined to indict Loehmann in Tamir\u2019s shooting, and in December federal authorities announced they would not bring federal criminal charges. \u201cI am glad that Loehmann will never have a badge and gun in Cleveland again,\u201d Tamir\u2019s mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement issued Tuesday.\nStillwater: A research project at Oklahoma State University aims to determine whether livestock producers can use virtual fence systems to control herds of cattle. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded researchers at the university more than $800,000 for the study in June. Researchers began studying the technology in February 2020 and have collaborated with California-based company Vence, which is developing the fencing systems, officials said. Thanks to the EPA grant, which provides funding for the next three years of the project, researchers say they\u2019re ready to study the technology until the cows come home. \u201cWe\u2019re ready now to move into some more long-term studies,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Wager, an OSU professor who is leading the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good project, and I\u2019m really excited about it.\u201d In some ways, the fences are similar to invisible fences for dogs and other domestic animals. Using a virtual fencing system, ranchers can set up boundary lines to contain cattle within pastures or specific parts of pastures. Cattle wear GPS-equipped collars around their necks that emit a sound when they are near a virtual boundary line. If cattle don\u2019t heed the sound, they\u2019ll receive an electric shock. The goal, researchers say, is to teach cattle to listen to the sound and turn around.\nSalem: The Oregon Department of Agriculture has filed a temporary emergency rule requiring all mink ranchers to vaccinate their animals against COVID-19. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said officials are looking to stop the coronavirus from mutating in mink and being passed back to humans. \u201cODA is taking the necessary precautions to reduce the risk of infection in captive mink, as well as reduce the risk of potential mutation of the virus and the potential for virus transmission back to humans,\u201d Scholz said in a statement. The state has given ranchers until the end of August to complete the inoculations. A 2020 report by Fur Commission USA counts 11 permitted mink farms in Oregon with an estimated 438,327 animals. That makes Oregon the fourth-largest pelt-producing state behind Wisconsin, Utah and Idaho. Eight of Oregon\u2019s mink farms are in Marion County, with two in Clatsop County and one in Linn County.\nHarrisburg: The head of a county child welfare agency in northeastern Pennsylvania was charged Tuesday with ordering workers to falsely close files on allegations of child abuse and neglect in response to public reports of a significant backlog of cases. The state attorney general\u2019s office accused Joanne G. Van Saun, 58, of Dallas, Pennsylvania, with child endangerment and obstruction for ending investigations in order to clear the backlog at the Luzerne County Department of Children and Youth Services. She resigned from her position as agency director Friday. Van Saun\u2019s attorney, Patrick A. Casey, declined comment. In court documents, investigators said Van Saun set up a team led by three senior aides to address a backlog of nearly 1,400 cases that was reported by The Citizens\u2019 Voice of Wilkes-Barre in 2017. \u201cVan Saun told the three leaders that she wanted the backlog eradicated immediately, and that she did not care how they did it,\u201d according to the probable cause affidavit used to charge her. Investigators said people who worked under Van Saun described her as a bully and tyrant. Authorities claim more than 200 referrals from the state-run ChildLine hotline were improperly at her direction in May 2017, including reports of an adult telling children to kill themselves and a 100-pound child still using a diaper.\nProvidence: The more people who get vaccinated against COVID-19, the more charities in the state stand to benefit under a program announced Tuesday by Gov. Daniel McKee. Under the COVID-19 Vaccination Incentive Fund, for every 5,000 additional people who get a first dose of a vaccine, an increasing amount of money will be granted to Rhode Island nonprofits. It starts with $100,000 after the first 5,000 shots, up to $200,000 for the fifth round of 5,000 shots, officials said. Other states have vaccine incentive programs, but they usually benefit individuals in the form of cash prizes or scholarships. The $750,000 program is funded by $500,000 from the state and $250,000 from the Rhode Island Foundation. \u201cWe did intentional research and reflection to create a program that celebrates the spirit of Rhode Island, sustains the importance of getting all Rhode Islanders vaccinated over time, and provides support back to the organizations that are getting our most vulnerable neighbors through the pandemic,\u201d the Democratic governor said in a statement. Eligible nonprofits based in the state can apply starting immediately through the Rhode Island Foundation\u2019s website. Applications will be accepted through July 30. Eligible organizations must provide services or direct assistance in response to the pandemic.\nColumbia: A group that considers pay raises for the leaders of state agencies has agreed to give tens of thousands of dollars in pay increases to five directors. There was only one vote Thursday against the raises by the Agency Head Salary Commission, with most members agreeing the extra pay is needed to keep talented leaders with increased competition from private industries, The State newspaper reports. \u201cUnfortunately we have been behind the curve on salaries in South Carolina,\u201d said House Majority Leader Gary Simrill, R-Rock Hill, who acknowledged the increases would draw public scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to hire and retain talent.\u201d The raises range from 19% to 48% on salaries that now range from $245,000 to nearly $300,000. Secretary of Transportation Christy Hall got a 19% bump to $298,000 a little over a year after getting a 32% raise. \u201cI use Secretary Hall as a prime example of a person who understands an agency from top to bottom,\u201d Simrill said. The lone vote against the raises came from Senate President Harvey Peeler. The Republican from Gaffney suggested the raises could be spread out over three years as he pointed out that the amount of the increase for some leaders was more than the yearly pay for some state employees, while still saying the directors had \u201cearned their pay.\u201d\nRapid City: Protesters climbed a grain mill downtown and hung a giant upside-down American flag on the building to protest mistreatment of American Indians. The Rapid City Journal reports the \u201cFourth of You Lie\u201d protest began at a park Sunday evening. Candi Brings Plenty, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, read a list of demands that included forming releasing police disciplinary records, calling for external reviews of police brutality allegations and creating an American Indian commission. Dozens of protesters marched through the streets. The protest was intended to end at the Pennington County jail but continued to the Dakota Mill and Grain Silo after a group of protesters broke off and headed there to hang the flag, which was emblazoned with the words \u201cLand Back.\u201d\nNashville: Three fire lookout towers are among seven properties across the state recently named to the National Register of Historic Places, officials said. The Tennessee Historical Commission said Friday that the locations were deemed worthy of making the list of important cultural resources in the U.S. The commission said the Big Hill Fire Lookout Tower in Marion County, the Twinton Fire Lookout Tower in Overton County, and the Chuck Swan Fire Lookout Tower in Union County have been named to the register. The towers, which range from 60 to 100 feet tall, allowed rangers to monitor fire activity more easily than they would on the ground. Tennessee once had 208 lookout towers, but little more than half remain, the commission said. Also placed on the the register were the T-201 Aircraft Hangar in Coffee County, the Overton Park Court Apartments in Shelby County, and Beck Knob Cemetery and the Price-Evans Foundry, both in Hamilton County.\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday demanded that the Texas Public Utility Commission take immediate action to shore up the state\u2019s troubled electrical grid, targeting renewable energy and blaming it for some of the problems. In a letter to the commission, Abbott directed the board to take steps to increase the amount of electricity produced in the state. Specifically, Abbott told the utility commission to work to provide incentives for the construction and maintenance of natural gas, coal and nuclear power. Further, Abbott directed his appointees at the utility commission to take aim at wind and solar power, which have been criticized for their perceived unpredictability in producing power, even as failures at natural gas plants played a significant role in power failures during the February freeze and in last month\u2019s conservation call. Abbott directed the utility commission to begin assessing \u201creliability costs,\u201d which could take the form of fines, to power plants \u201cthat cannot guarantee their own availability, such as wind or solar power,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWhen they fail to do so, those generators should shoulder the costs of that failure,\u201d Abbott\u2019s letter says. \u201cFailing to do so creates an uneven playing field between non-renewable and renewable energy generators and creates uncertainty of available generation in\u201d the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say a rare animal spotted in a nearby neighborhood likely has been on the move in search of a new place to live. A home doorbell camera caught the wolverine on video Thursday in west Layton, about 15 miles west of Salt Lake City, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Utah Division of Wildlife Resources officials believe it was the same animal seen on nearby Antelope Island in early May. Wolverines have been spotted in Utah only six times. The last time before this year was in 2016. The largest members of the weasel family, wolverines look like a combination of a skunk and bear and reach 40 pounds. They are rare in the Rocky Mountain region and typically found in high mountain areas. Males usually establish a territory with one to three females, leaving two other males on average to rove in search of their own territories, said wildlife biologist and Wolverine Foundation board member Jeff Copeland. \u201cIn doing so they can end up in some really odd places we\u2019ve seen over the years,\u201d Copeland said. Wolverines often don\u2019t shy away from people but aren\u2019t dangerous, just naturally curious, he said. Wolverines declined in the U.S. before beginning to rebound in the 1960s.\nMontpelier: The Vermont Statehouse opened to the public Tuesday after being closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. People can tour the Montpelier landmark again, but guided tours won\u2019t be resuming yet. Visitors will be able to take self-guided tours on their phones. Vaccinations are recommended but not required. While visitors are allowed, lawmakers are still figuring out how they will continue to conduct the people\u2019s business after the pandemic. During the pandemic, lawmakers held video meetings. \u201cWe were able to flip the lights off pretty quick. I think that\u2019s a testament to the flexibility of the Legislature and the public,\u201d Capitol Police Chief Matthew Romei told WCAX-TV. \u201cBut flipping it back on is going to take a little bit of work.\u201d\nRichmond: Officials in the capital city plan to resume evicting families from public housing units for the first time in nearly two years if they have failed to pay their rent. The Times-Dispatch reports that over 800 households in units overseen by the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority had entered repayment plans for delinquent balances totaling about $1 million as of mid-June. Nearly 700 of them had fallen behind on those agreements, according to a housing official. The authority, which oversees roughly 3,700 units, had agreed to halt evictions in 2019 under pressure from tenants\u2019 advocates. After the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a government moratorium protected tenants from getting evicted. Households that are more than two months behind on their rent could face eviction in August, but the housing authority said it will not pursue cases against tenants who are in the pipeline for rent relief.\nSpokane: A vandal smashed 14 windows at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Spokane Valley over the weekend. Paul Dillon, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, said the vandalism occurred about 12:30 p.m. Saturday, and a suspect was arrested on site soon after. Dillon said multiple witnesses observed the incident, which was recorded by security cameras, The Spokesman-Review reports. \u201cHe collected a bunch of rocks and started smashing windows in the building, including every front window and the main clinic entrance,\u201d Dillon said of the suspect. Dillon noted the vandalism occurred the day after a court hearing was conducted in which a Spokane County judge heard arguments in the lawsuit the local Planned Parenthood organization filed against the Church at Planned Parenthood, an abortion protest group, alleging its frequent religious services and noisy demonstrations held outside the Spokane clinic have interfered with treatment and intimidated patients and staff. On Friday, Planned Parenthood sought a permanent injunction against the group. Dillon speculated that Saturday\u2019s vandalism might be connected to Friday\u2019s court action.\nCharleston: The state has crossed the threshold of 1 million residents receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The milestone announced by Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday equates to 64.5% of all residents ages 12 and up. Nearly 54%, or about 837,000, of residents 12 and up have received both vaccines. Justice acknowledged at a news conference that the state is \u201cin our infancy\u201d with the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus and that the odds are \u201castronomical\u201d that there will be substantially more cases of it among unvaccinated residents. According to state health data, 12 cases of the delta variant, which was first detected in India and now has been found in more than 80 countries, have been reported in West Virginia. There have been 2,901 deaths from the virus in the state since the start of the pandemic. \u201cIf you\u2019re out there in West Virginia, and you\u2019re not vaccinated today, what\u2019s the downside?\u201d Justice said. \u201cIf all of us were vaccinated, do you not believe that less people would die? If you\u2019re not vaccinated, you\u2019re part of the problem rather than part of the solution.\u201d\nMadison: As many as one-third of the state\u2019s gray wolves likely died at the hands of humans in the months after the federal government announced it was ending legal protections, according to a study released Monday. Poaching and a February hunt that far exceeded kill quotas were largely responsible for the drop-off, University of Wisconsin scientists said, though some other scientists say more direct evidence is needed for some of the calculations. Adrian Treves, an environmental studies professor, said his team\u2019s findings should raise doubts about having another hunting season this fall and serve notice to wildlife managers in other states with wolves. Removing federal protections \u201copens the door for antagonists to kill large numbers in short periods, legally and illegally,\u201d Treves and two colleagues said in a paper published by the journal PeerJ. \u201cThe history of political scapegoating of wolves may repeat itself.\u201d The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dropped gray wolves in the Lower 48 states from its list of endangered and threatened species in January, shortly before former President Donald Trump left office. Agency biologists have long argued that the predator has recovered from persecution that nearly wiped it out by the mid-20th century.\nGillette: A man who asked a sheriff\u2019s dispatcher why he hadn\u2019t been arrested soon found himself in handcuffs. The 62-year-old called the Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s Office on June 24 to ask why he hadn\u2019t been arrested after deputies raided his house the previous day. Asked why he should be arrested, the man said meth use, according to Undersheriff Quentin Reynolds. The man also told a dispatcher 10 young men were following him. Nobody had raided the man\u2019s house or was planning to arrest him, Reynolds said. After the call, a deputy spotted the man driving and followed when he pulled off the road, the Gillette News Record reports. The man allegedly told the deputy he had used methamphetamine a day and a half before and was still high. He did poorly on sobriety tests and was arrested for driving under the influence of a controlled substance."

Wayne Marotto, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition Operation Inherent Resolve, confirmed on Twitter.\nMarotto said the rockets landed on the base and its perimeter, and force defensive measures were activated. He later tweeted that all of the personnel at the base were accounted for following the attack, though \u201ctwo personnel sustained minor injuries\u201d and damage is still to be assessed.\nWho did it: The United States did not immediately blame a specific group for the attack, though Marotto tweeted it was carried out by an \u201cOMG,\u201d which in this case means outlaw militia group.\nA militant group calling itself \u201cThe brigades to avenge al-Muhandis\u201d took responsibility for the attack on al-Assad, saying it will force U.S. troops \u201cto leave our lands defeated.\u201d\nThe group takes its name from Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, killed last year alongside Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Trump administration-ordered drone strike in Baghdad.\nMeanwhile, in Syria: Also on Wednesday, U.S.-backed forces in Syria said they stopped a drone attack on the al-Omar oil field in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, where U.S. troops are also located.\nContext: Wednesday\u2019s incidents are the type of attacks the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias were meant to respond to and deter.\nBut Wednesday\u2019s attacks were just the latest since those June 27 airstrikes.\nAmong the most recent attacks was one Monday at al Asad where three rockets landed at the base perimeter and caused no injuries. Also Monday, the State Department said defensive systems at the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad eliminated an airborne threat.\nAnd on Tuesday, Erbil Air Base came under attack from a drone, but there were no injuries reported.\nThe Air Force is largely responsible for a 2017 mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a federal judge has ruled, citing the service\u2019s failure to enter the gunman's criminal history into a federal background check database that might have prevented him from purchasing firearms.\nDevin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people and wounded 22 others when he opened fire at the First Baptist Church; he killed himself shortly after what was the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history.\nIn court documents filed on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez for the Western District of Texas ruled that Kelley was 40 percent responsible for the shooting while the U.S. government was 60 percent responsible.\n\u201cThe evidence shows that \u2014 had the Government done its job and properly reported Kelley\u2019s information into the background check system \u2014 it is more likely than not that Kelley would have been deterred from carrying out the Church shooting,\u201d Rodriguez wrote.\nBackground: The ruling came in response to a 2018 civil complaint that families of the shooting's victims filed against the Air Force alleging negligence.\nKelley was given a bad conduct discharge from the Air Force in 2014 after being convicted in the military justice system of domestic assault.\nBut his criminal record and fingerprints were never given to the FBI and so he passed background checks when he purchased firearms in preparation for his attack.\nThe shocking assassination of Haiti\u2019s president on Wednesday has given new urgency to an already dire situation in a country rocked by political instability, ongoing suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing violent crime.\nIn the United States, President Biden condemned the shooting death of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse and offered assistance for a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Haiti.\nThe overture comes just two months after the Biden administration, in recognition of the fraught security situation, extended temporary protected status for Haitians residing in the U.S. who fled their country after a massive earthquake in 2010 created a humanitarian crisis.\nWhat happened: Mo\u00efse\u2019s killing at his private home on the outskirts of the capital Port-au-Prince is shrouded in mystery, with few details beyond Acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph saying the nighttime attack was highly coordinated and carried out by a trained and heavily armed group.\nFirst lady Martine Mo\u00efse was also shot and is said to be undergoing treatment.\nA Haitian official called the attackers \u201cmercenaries,\u201d the Miami Herald reported, while noting that video taken by residents near Mo\u00efse\u2019s house included audio of someone invoking the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), yelling in English: \u201cDEA operation. Everybody stand down. DEA operation. Everybody back up, stand down.\u201d\nBut sources told the newspaper that the assailants, one of whom reportedly spoke English with an American accent, were not with the DEA.\nPublic resentment against Mo\u00efse had been building over the past two years, and the circumstances surrounding his assassination have raised questions about what motivations were at play.\nUS lawmaker reaction: Members of Congress expressed shock and devastation at Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination, warning of the possibility of further turmoil in the island nation.\nAmong the reactions was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who said the entire federal government condemns the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse and the attack on his wife as a \"barbaric act\" and said the U.S. stands \"ready to provide support and assistance to the people of Haiti during this challenging time.\u201d\nRep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), co-chair of the House Haiti Caucus and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the assassination of the Haitian president a heinous act and criticized the Biden administration, and international community, for failing to anticipate the atrocity.\n\u201cThe murder of Jovenel Mo\u00efse is a devastating if not shocking example of the extent to which the security situation in Haiti has unraveled. For months, violent actors have terrorized the Haitian people with impunity while the international community\u2014the United States included, I fear\u2014has failed to heed their cries to change course and support a Haitian-led democratic transition,\u201d Levin wrote in a statement.\nIn another step closer to normality, the Pentagon announced Wednesday evening it will drop its health protection level from \u201cbravo\u201d to \u201calpha\u201d on Friday morning.\nThat means maximum occupancy at the Pentagon will now be 90 percent, up from 50 percent.\nHealth Protection Condition \u201cAlpha is not a return to pre-COVID-19 \u2018normal,\u2019\u201d the department said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWhile COVID-19 cases and positive test results in the National Capital Region and communities nationwide have significantly decreased since May 2021, the pandemic is still ongoing, and many people are not yet fully vaccinated. The Pentagon Reservation will continue force health protection measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within our workforce.\u201d\nThe Potomac Officers Club will hold its 2021 Air Force Acquisition Forum at 8 a.m. Speakers include Darlene Costello, the Air Force\u2019s acting assistant secretary for acquisition technology and logistics. https://bit.ly/3hNJilg\nView the discussion thread.\nThe contents of this site are \u00a92021 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc."

He was court-martialed in 2012 for assaulting his wife and stepson and was subject to a bad conduct discharge and one year of confinement.\nDespite Kelley's violent history, he was able to pass mandatory background checks to purchase four different firearms from licensed firearm dealers after he was discharged. Among them was an AR-556 rifle that he used in the church shooting, according to the court ruling.\nAfter the shooting, the Air Force publicly admitted that it could have prevented Kelley from buying firearms, according to the Associated Press.\nKelley would not have passed background checks to purchase the firearms if his convictions were entered into the FBI database, the court ruling said. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, people convicted of a misdemeanor crime involving domestic violence are prohibited from owning firearms.\n\"USAF agents and leadership had an obligation\u2014and multiple opportunities\u2014to ensure that Kelley's fingerprints and criminal history were submitted to the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (\"CJIS\") Division for inclusion in its databases,\" Rodriguez said in the court ruling.\nThe Texas Supreme Court last month ruled that the store that sold the rifle used in the shooting to Kelley could not be sued. Families of the victims and survivors had filed a lawsuit against Academy Sports + Outdoors, but the court dismissed it because the background check conducted by the store did not show Kelley's charges.\nGot a confidential news tip?

                    "value": "Are we alone in the universe? So far, the only life we know of is right here on Earth. But here at NASA, we\u2019re looking.\nNASA is exploring the solar system and beyond to help us answer fundamental questions about life beyond our home planet. From studying the habitability of Mars, probing promising \u201coceans worlds,\u201d such as Titan and Europa, to identifying Earth-size planets around distant stars, our science missions are working together with a goal to find unmistakable signs of life beyond Earth (a field of science called astrobiology).\nThrough the study of astrobiology, NASA invests in understanding the origins, evolution, and limits of life on Earth. This work has been important in shaping ideas about where to focus search for life efforts. As NASA explores the solar system, our understanding of life on Earth and the potential for life on other worlds has changed alongside the many discoveries. The study of organisms in extreme environments on Earth, from the polar plateau of Antarctica to the depths of the ocean, have highlighted that life as we know it is highly adaptable, but not always easy to find. The search for life requires great care, and is based in the knowledge we gain by studying life on Earth through the lens of astrobiology. If there\u2019s something out there, we may not yet know how to recognize it.\nDive into the past, present, and future of NASA\u2019s search for life in the universe.\nOver 45 years ago, the Viking Project found a place in history when it became the first U.S. mission to land a spacecraft safely on the surface of Mars.\nViking 1 and 2, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander, were NASA\u2019s first attempt to search for life on another planet and thus the first mission dedicated to astrobiology. The mission\u2019s biology experiments revealed unexpected chemical activity in the Martian soil, but provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms near the landing sites.\nNASA\u2019s Galileo mission orbited Jupiter for almost eight years, and made close passes by all its major moons. Galileo returned data that continues to shape astrobiology science \u2013\u2013 particularly the discovery that Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa has evidence of a subsurface ocean with more water than the total amount of liquid water found on Earth. These findings also expanded the search for habitable environments outside of the traditional \u201chabitable zone\u201d of a system, the distance from a star at which liquid water can persist on the surface of a planet.\nFor more than a decade, the Cassini spacecraft shared the wonders of Saturn and its family of icy moons \u2013\u2013 taking us to astonishing worlds and expanding our understanding of the kinds of worlds where life might exist.\nFor the first time, astrobiologists were able to see through the thick atmosphere of Titan and study the moon\u2019s surface, where they found lakes and seas filled with liquid hydrocarbons. Astrobiologists are studying what these liquid hydrocarbons could mean for life\u2019s potential on Titan. Cassini also witnessed icy plumes erupting from Saturn\u2019s small moon Enceladus. When flying through the plumes, the spacecraft found evidence of saltwater and organic chemicals. This raised questions about whether habitable environments could exist beneath the surface of Enceladus.\nNASA\u2019s twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, launched towards Mars in 2003 in search of answers about the history of water on Mars. Originally a three-month prime mission, both robotic explorers far outlasted their original missions and spent years collecting data at the surface of Mars.\nSpirit and Opportunity were the first mission to prove liquid water, a key ingredient for life, had once flowed across the surface of Mars. Their findings shaped our understanding of Mars\u2019 geology and past environments, and importantly suggested Mars\u2019 ancient environments may once have been suitable for life.\nNASA\u2019s first planet-hunting mission, the Kepler Space Telescope, paved the way for our search for life in the solar system and beyond. An important part of Kepler\u2019s work was the identification of Earth-size planets around distant stars.\nAfter nine years in deep space, collecting data that indicate our sky to be filled with billions of hidden planets \u2013 more planets even than stars \u2013 the space telescope retired in 2018. Kepler left a legacy of more than 2,600 exoplanet discoveries, many of which could be promising places for life.\nOver its sixteen years in space, the Spitzer Space Telescope evolved into a premier tool for studying exoplanets, using its infrared view of the universe. Spitzer marked a new age in planetary science as one of the first telescopes to directly detect light from the atmospheres of planets outside the solar system, or exoplanets. This enabled scientists to study the composition of those atmospheres and even learn about the weather on these distant worlds.\nSpitzer\u2019s infrared instruments allowed scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes, including dusty stellar nurseries, the centers of galaxies, and newly forming planetary systems. Spitzer\u2019s infrared eyes also enabled astronomers to see cooler objects in space, like failed stars (brown dwarfs), extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds, and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets.\nSince it launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has made immense contributions to astrobiology. Astronomers used Hubble to make the first measurements of the atmospheric composition of extrasolar planets, and Hubble is now vigorously characterizing exoplanet atmospheres with constituents such as sodium, hydrogen, and water vapor. Hubble observations are also providing clues about how planets form, through studies of dust and debris disks around young stars.\nNot all of Hubble\u2019s contributions involve distant targets. Hubble has also been used to study bodies within the solar system, including asteroids, comets, planets, and moons, such as the intriguing ocean-bearing icy moons Europa and Ganymede. Hubble has provided invaluable insight into life\u2019s potential in the solar system and beyond.\nNASA\u2019s atmosphere-sniffing Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission launched in November 2013 and began orbiting Mars roughly a year later. Since that time, the mission has made fundamental contributions to understanding the history of the Martian atmosphere and climate.\nAstrobiologists are working with this atmospheric data to better understand how and when Mars lost its water and identifying periods in Mars\u2019 history when habitable environments were most likely to exist at the planet\u2019s surface.\nFor two decades, NASA\u2019s Mars Odyssey \u2013 the longest-lived spacecraft at the Red Planet \u2013 has helped locate ice, assess landing sites, and study the planet\u2019s mysterious moons.\nOdyssey has provided global maps of chemical elements and minerals that make up the surface of Mars. These detailed maps are used by astrobiologists to determine the evolution of the Martian environment and its potential for life.\nNASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is on a search for evidence that water persisted on the surface of Mars for a long period of time. While other Mars missions have shown that water flowed across the surface in Mars\u2019 history, it remains a mystery whether water was ever around long enough to provide a habitat for life.\nData from MRO is essential to astrobiologists studying the potential for habitable environments on past and present Mars. Additionally, these studies are important in building climate models for Mars, and for use in comparative planetology studies for the potential habitability of exoplanets that orbit distant stars.\nThe Curiosity Mars rover is studying whether Mars ever had environments capable of supporting microbial life. In other words, its mission is to determine whether the planet had all of the ingredients life needs \u2013 such as water, carbon, and a source of energy \u2013 by studying its climate and geology.\nIt\u2019s been nearly nine years since Curiosity touched down on Mars in 2012, and the robot geologist keeps making new discoveries. Curiosity provided evidence that freshwater lakes filled Gale Grater billions of years ago. Lakes and groundwater persisted for millions of years and contained all the key elements necessary for life, demonstrating Mars was once habitable.\nThe Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is the next step in the search for planets outside of our solar system, including those that could support life. Launched in 2018, TESS is on a mission to survey the entire sky and is expected to discover and catalogue thousands of exoplanets around nearby bright stars.\nTo date, TESS has discovered more than 120 confirmed exoplanets and more than 2,600 planet candidates. The planet-hunter will continue to find exoplanets targets that NASA\u2019s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will study in further detail.\nNASA\u2019s newest robot astrobiologist, the Perseverance Mars rover, touched down safely on Mars on February 18, 2021, and is kicking off a new era of exploration on the Red Planet. Perseverance will search for signs of ancient microbial life, which will advance the agency\u2019s quest to explore the past habitability of Mars.\nWhat really sets this mission apart is that the rover has a drill to collect core samples of Martian rock and soil, and will store them in sealed tubes for pickup by a future Mars Sample Return mission that would ferry them back to Earth for detailed analysis.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (Webb), slated to launch in 2021, will be the premier space-based observatory of the next decade. Webb is a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror.\nWebb observations will be used to study every phase in the history of the universe, including planets and moons in our solar system, and the formation of distant solar systems potentially capable of supporting life on Earth-like exoplanets. The Webb telescope will also be capable of making detailed observations of the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars, to search for the building blocks of life on Earth-like planets beyond our solar system.\nJupiter\u2019s moon Europa may have the potential to harbor life. The Europa Clipper mission will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Europa and investigate whether the icy moon could harbor conditions suitable for life. Targeting a 2024 launch, the mission will place a spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter in order to perform a detailed investigation of Europa \u2013\u2013 a world that shows strong evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust.\nEuropa Clipper is not a life-detection mission, though it will investigate whether the icy moon, with its subsurface ocean, has the capability to support life. Understanding Europa\u2019s habitability will help scientists better understand how life developed on Earth and the potential for finding life beyond our planet.\nThe Dragonfly mission will deliver a rotorcraft to visit Saturn\u2019s largest and richly organic moon, Titan. Slated for launch in 2027 and arrival in 2034, Dragonfly will sample and examine dozens of promising sites around Saturn\u2019s icy moon and advance our search for the building blocks of life.\nThis revolutionary mission will explore diverse locations to look for prebiotic chemical processes common on both Titan and Earth. Titan is an analog to the very early Earth, and can provide clues to how prebiotic chemistry under these conditions may have progressed.\nSlated to launch in the mid-2020s, the Roman Space Telescope will have a field of view that is 200 times greater than the Hubble infrared instrument, capturing more of the sky with less observing time. In addition to ground-breaking astrophysics and cosmology, the primary instrument on Roman, the Wide Field Instrument, has a rich menu of exoplanet science. It will perform a microlensing survey of the inner Milky Way that will reveal thousands of worlds orbiting within the habitable zone of their star and farther out, while providing an additional bounty of more than 100,000 transiting exoplanets.\nThe mission will also be fitted with \u201cstarglasses,\u201d a coronagraph instrument that can block out the glare from a star and allow astronomers to directly image giant planets in orbit around it. The coronagraph will provide the first in-space demonstration of technologies needed for future missions to image and characterize smaller, rocky planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. Roman coronagraph will make observations that could contribute to the discovery of new worlds beyond our solar system and advance the study of extrasolar planets that could be suitable for life.\nI think its time for NASA to tell the truth about UFO\u2019S n aliens if anyone still trust NASA means they r the last species of human on earth.\n? NASA is a US government agency and through democracy you can generally trust your governments. ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos and CNSA agree on astrobiology.\nUFOs are something else entirely, it\u2019s in the name: \u201cunidentified\u201d. So far, the fact is that nothing interesting or unexpected have come out of the classification.\nI think it is very well possible to encounter life on other planets. Ot necessarily with the dame characteristics as our life on earth.\n..\nAgreed, biologists in general observe the insignificant delay before the first sediments had life and the methods point to that biology split from geology in the original global ocean (likely before plate tectonics, and so continents, and so sediments).\n\u201cThe rest is detail\u201d, but it looks like an easy, fecund (often species splitting) process.\nNASA should stop looking for life in the universe ,they should start looking what kind of life there is.\nThey must find it first, obviously.\nI hope that I live long enough for conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial organisms to be found.\nEmail address is optional.

                    "value": "Giant water plumes erupting from Enceladus have long fascinated scientists and the public alike, inspiring research and speculation about the vast ocean that is believed to be sandwiched between the moon's rocky core and its icy shell. Flying through the plumes and sampling their chemical makeup, the Cassini spacecraft detected a relatively high concentration of certain molecules associated with hydrothermal vents on the bottom of Earth's oceans, specifically dihydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. The amount of methane found in the plumes was particularly unexpected.\n\"We wanted to know: Could Earthlike microbes that 'eat' the dihydrogen and produce methane explain the surprisingly large amount of methane detected by Cassini?\" said Regis Ferriere, an associate professor in the University of Arizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and one of the study's two lead authors. \"Searching for such microbes, known as methanogens, at Enceladus' seafloor would require extremely challenging deep-dive missions that are not in sight for several decades.\"\nFerriere and his team took a different, easier route: They constructed mathematical models to calculate the probability that different processes, including biological methanogenesis, might explain the Cassini data.\nThe authors applied new mathematical models that combine geochemistry and microbial ecology to analyze Cassini plume data and model the possible processes that would best explain the observations. They conclude that Cassini's data are consistent either with microbial hydrothermal vent activity, or with processes that don't involve life forms but are different from the ones known to occur on Earth.\nOn Earth, hydrothermal activity occurs when cold seawater seeps into the ocean floor, circulates through the underlying rock and passes close by a heat source, such as a magma chamber, before spewing out into the water again through hydrothermal vents. On Earth, methane can be produced through hydrothermal activity, but at a slow rate. Most of the production is due to microorganisms that harness the chemical disequilibrium of hydrothermally produced dihydrogen as a source of energy, and produce methane from carbon dioxide in a process called methanogenesis.\nThe team looked at Enceladus' plume composition as the end result of several chemical and physical processes taking place in the moon's interior. First, the researchers assessed what hydrothermal production of dihydrogen would best fit Cassini's observations, and whether this production could provide enough \"food\" to sustain a population of Earthlike hydrogenotrophic methanogens. To do that, they developed a model for the population dynamics of a hypothetical hydrogenotrophic methanogen, whose thermal and energetic niche was modeled after known strains from Earth.\nThe authors then ran the model to see whether a given set of chemical conditions, such as the dihydrogen concentration in the hydrothermal fluid, and temperature would provide a suitable environment for these microbes to grow. They also looked at what effect a hypothetical microbe population would have on its environment\u2014for example, on the escape rates of dihydrogen and methane in the plume.\n\"In summary, not only could we evaluate whether Cassini's observations are compatible with an environment habitable for life, but we could also make quantitative predictions about observations to be expected, should methanogenesis actually occur at Enceladus' seafloor,\" Ferriere explained.\nThe results suggest that even the highest possible estimate of abiotic methane production\u2014or methane production without biological aid\u2014based on known hydrothermal chemistry is far from sufficient to explain the methane concentration measured in the plumes. Adding biological methanogenesis to the mix, however, could produce enough methane to match Cassini's observations.\n\"Obviously, we are not concluding that life exists in Enceladus' ocean,\" Ferriere said. \"Rather, we wanted to understand how likely it would be that Enceladus' hydrothermal vents could be habitable to Earthlike microorganisms. Very likely, the Cassini data tell us, according to our models.\n\"And biological methanogenesis appears to be compatible with the data. In other words, we can't discard the 'life hypothesis' as highly improbable. To reject the life hypothesis, we need more data from future missions,\" he added.\nThe authors hope their paper provides guidance for studies aimed at better understanding the observations made by Cassini and that it encourages research to elucidate the abiotic processes that could produce enough methane to explain the data.\nFor example, methane could come from the chemical breakdown of primordial organic matter that may be present in Enceladus' core and that could be partially turned into dihydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide through the hydrothermal process. This hypothesis is very plausible if it turns out that Enceladus formed through the accretion of organic-rich material supplied by comets, Ferriere explained.\n\"It partly boils down to how probable we believe different hypotheses are to begin with,\" he said. \"For example, if we deem the probability of life in Enceladus to be extremely low, then such alternative abiotic mechanisms become much more likely, even if they are very alien compared to what we know here on Earth.\"\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

The researchers were confident\u00a0that the methane concentration measured by Cassini was too high to have been produced by known physical processes found on Earth, though that doesn't rule out the possibility that unrecorded abiotic processes are the cause, rather than something biological in nature.\nRegis Ferriere, an associate professor at the University of Arizona, summed up the purpose of the study. \"Obviously, we are not concluding that life exists in Enceladus' ocean,\" he said. \"Rather, we wanted to underscore how likely it would be that Enceladus' hydrothermal vents could be habitable to Earth-like microorganisms. Very likely, the Cassini data tell us, according to our models.\" Read more at Science Daily.\nCopyright \u00a9 Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

                    "value": "There\u2019s always big news coming from outer space. Scientists and researchers are studying Mars extensively, discovering new types of supernovas, and finding neutron star and black hole pairings. But for the rest of us humans, there isn\u2019t anything quite as exciting as the possibility of life on other planets. (Honestly, this one is getting very messy and we high-key want to leave.) So far, we haven\u2019t heard of any confirmed alien sightings on another planet, but there may actually be signs of life near Saturn. Yep, the favorite planet of many children (because of its rings, obvs) could have some microbes on one of its many moons.\nThis news, which we picked up from New Atlas, is a pretty cool development. According to the report, something is creating methane on Enceladus, one of Saturn\u2019s moons. Methane is a greenhouse gas that microorganisms simultaneously break down and produce. The levels of methane on Enceladus are so high that it matches what scientists would expect from microbes.\nEnceladus doesn\u2019t seem like a prime place for microscopic life, given its icy outer surface. However, just beyond that layer is an oceanlike slush with a seafloor with hydrothermal vents. That watery substance sometimes breaks through its cold shell in water plumes, similar to a geyser erupting on Earth. Further evidence comes NASA/ESA/ISA\u2019s Cassini space probe, which has studied the ringed planet and its moons to discover carbon dioxide and dihydrogen, too. So, what does this mean? It\u2019s likely that microbes might be hanging out down there. Of course, this isn\u2019t a full-stop conclusion, which R\u00e9gis Ferri\u00e8re, co-lead author of this study, explains in the research that\u2019s published in Nature Astronomy.\n\u201cObviously, we are not concluding that life exists in Enceladus\u2019 ocean,\u201d says Ferri\u00e8re. \u201cRather, we wanted to understand how likely it would be that Enceladus\u2019 hydrothermal vents could be habitable to Earthlike microorganisms. Very likely, the Cassini data tell us, according to our models. And biological methanogenesis appears to be compatible with the data.\u201d\nWe will have to keep an eye on what comes in the future studies of our always intriguing solar system.\nThe post One of Saturn\u2019s Moons Has Shown Possible Signs of Microbial Life appeared first on Nerdist.\nYou\u2019re on the precipice of something utterly new.\nExpect to rebuild your life from the ground up.\nIn August 2021, 28 year-old Sarafina Nance will participate in HI-SEAS, a Mars simulation run by the International MoonBase Alliance (IMA). While separate from NASA, her mission will feature collaboration with NASA Goddard, and for two weeks she will live in a habitat in Mauna Loa, Hawai'i that's designed to mimic the experience of living on Mars. \u201cMy crew is six people and we basically live like we're on Mars for two weeks. So that includes wearing space suits every time we leave the habitat,\u201d Nance tells Yahoo Life.\"It's really trying to simulate as much of living on Mars as possible to prepare astronauts in the future.\" Pushing her body to its physical limits has been important to Nance, who previously chronicled her own health journey on social media. At 23, her father was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer, which inspired Nance to get genetic testing. Her results revealed that she was positive for the BRCA two genetic mutation, which gave her an 87% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 30% risk of ovarian cancer. \u201cWhen I was 26, I got my preventative double mastectomy to decrease my risk from 87% to less than 5%. I had three surgeries in one year, and my last one was almost exactly a year ago,\u201d says Nance. The astrophysicist calls her diagnosis \"anxiety-producing,\" and says she chose to document her journey in hopes of empowering others to advocate for their own health. Today, Nance is looking to the future, and beyond. \u201cI feel really, really lucky to have this opportunity to be able to pursue my dreams, especially after something that made me uncertain whether I would ever be able to do something like this,\u201d says Nance. \u201cI finally feel like I am physically in a good enough spot to be able to push my body and push my mind, and and see sort of what I'm capable of doing.\u201d\nEverything you need to know for the upcoming week.\nJenna Dewan took to Instagram to share two naked photos in honor of \"self love.\"\nAfter so much drama and many police visits, she got the upper hand.

                    "value": "The visionary jazz artist sketched an \u201cAstro-Black mythology\u201d that aligned ancient Egyptian history with a future human exodus \u201cbeyond the stars.\u201d\nWhen the aliens came for Sun Ra, they explained that he had been selected for his \u201cperfect discipline.\u201d Not every human was fit for space travel, but he, with his expert control over his mind and body, could survive the journey. According to Ra, this encounter happened in the nineteen-thirties, when he was enrolled in a teachers\u2019-training course at a college in Huntsville, Alabama. The aliens, who had little antennas growing above their eyes and on their ears, recognized in Ra a kindred spirit. They beamed him to Saturn and told him that a more meaningful path than teaching awaited him. They shared knowledge with him that freed him from the limits of the human imagination. They instructed him to wait until life on Earth seemed most hopeless; then he could finally speak, imparting to the world the \u201cequations\u201d for transcending human reality.\nThis instruction guided Ra for the rest of his life as a musician and a thinker. By the fifties, the signs of hopelessness were everywhere: racism, the threat of nuclear war, social movements that sought political freedom but not cosmic enlightenment. In response, during the next four decades\u2014until his death, in 1993\u2014Ra released more than a hundred albums of visionary jazz. Some consisted of anarchic, noisy \u201cspace music.\u201d Others featured lush, whimsical takes on Gershwin or Disney classics. All were intended as dance music, even if few people knew the steps.\nRa was born Herman Poole Blount in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1914, to a supportive, religious family. He was named after Black Herman, a magician who claimed to be from the \u201cdark jungles of Africa\u201d and who infused his death-defying escape acts with hoodoo mysticism. Early on, Ra showed a prodigious talent for piano playing and music composition. After his purported alien visitation, he left college and eventually moved to Chicago, where he played in strip clubs, accompanied local blues singers, and found a place in a big band.\nDuring Ra\u2019s childhood, archeologists had discovered the intact tomb of the pharaoh Tutankhamun. The news inspired many African Americans to draw pride from the Egyptian roots of human civilization. Chicago exposed Ra to new interpretations of Scripture by Black Muslims and Black Israelites, as well as to suppressed histories of Black struggle and works of science fiction. These influences soon permeated his playing. In 1952, he changed his name to Le Sony\u2019r Ra\u2014Sun Ra for short\u2014after the Egyptian god of the sun. On Chicago\u2019s South Side, he circulated mimeographed broadsheets with titles like \u201cTHE BIBLE WAS NOT WRITTEN FOR NEGROES!!!!!!!\u201d\nRa formed a band, later known as the Arkestra, which featured the saxophonists Marshall Allen, John Gilmore, and Pat Patrick. Rather than employing tight swings and ostentatious solos, they played in a ragged, exploratory style, with squiggles of electronic keyboard and off-kilter horns. In the early sixties, Ra and his bandmates moved to New York, and became known for wearing elaborate, colorful costumes that felt both ancient and futuristic.\nIn his album notes and interviews, Ra began sketching out an \u201cAstro-Black mythology,\u201d a way of aligning the history of ancient Egypt with a vision of a future human exodus \u201cbeyond the stars.\u201d The specifics of Ra\u2019s vision remained hazy, but he seemed to believe that the traumas of history\u2014most notably of American slavery\u2014had made life on Earth untenable. Humanity needed to break from it and travel to a technological paradise light-years away. \u201cIt\u2019s after the end of the world / Don\u2019t you know that yet?\u201d the singer June Tyson asks in the 1974 film \u201cSpace Is the Place.\u201d Ra referred to his teachings as \u201cmyths\u201d\u2014they were stories about the future, meant to guide us.\n\u201cThe impossible attracts me,\u201d he later explained, \u201cbecause everything possible has been done and the world didn\u2019t change.\u201d He gave instruments new names, like the \u201cspace-dimension mellophone,\u201d the \u201ccosmic tone organ,\u201d and the \u201csunharp.\u201d One band member remembered that, if you played something wrong, everyone else had to follow along, incorporating the mistake into the song. For Ra, the Arkestra weren\u2019t musicians at all; they were \u201ctone scientists.\u201d A 1967 album is titled \u201cCosmic Tones for Mental Therapy.\u201d\nIn 1968, Sun Ra and his bandmates moved into a house in Philadelphia. The group\u2019s communal ethos is a focus of \u201cSun Ra: A Joyful Noise,\u201d a 1980 film by Robert Mugge. For all his seeming eccentricity, Ra wasn\u2019t a free spirit in his personal life. He had an ascetic vision, supposedly abstaining from alcohol, drugs, sex, even sleep. He demanded that his band be available for practice at any hour of the day. Yet his mischievous side\u2014he once referred to himself as \u201cEarth\u2019s jester\u201d\u2014also comes across in the film. At one point, he offers a riddle about his true identity: \u201cSome call me Mr. Ra. Others call me Mr. Re. You can call me Mr. Mystery.\u201d In one practice session, Tyson sings a sputtering, raucous song called \u201cAstro Black,\u201d and the band members, who look as if they\u2019re dressed for at least three different outer-space movies, smile at the racket.\nThe British record label Strut recently reissued \u201cLanquidity,\u201d an album originally released in 1978. It is one of the best albums that the group recorded during its Philadelphia years, when it had settled into a style that toggled between enchanted, ethereal visions of deep space and woozy, demented takes on the jazz of the thirties and forties. The bandmates shielded themselves from the whims of the day, but the track \u201cWhere Pathways Meet\u201d rests on a surprisingly sturdy funk groove, a disco crossover flecked with the occasional blast of free-jazz soloing. The new edition of \u201cLanquidity\u201d includes the original mix of the album, copies of which were available only at the group\u2019s live performances. The minor differences between the versions are most obvious on the quieter numbers. Ra earned his stripes playing the blues, but, in the seventies and eighties, his recordings took on a more pensive quality. The track \u201cThere Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of)\u201d drags along, carried by chants and a funereal bass line. Ra\u2019s synthesizer sounds as if he were trying to evoke a shiver. Listen closely and you hear whispers: \u201cThere are other worlds they haven\u2019t told you about\u201d repeated by different voices, as though passing a secret. And then: \u201cThey wish to speak to you.\u201d\nIn 1969, Esquire canvassed a range of celebrities, including Muhammad Ali, Ayn Rand, and Leonard Nimoy, for suggestions about what Neil Armstrong should say as he set foot on the moon. Most people provided grave warnings or made jokes. Sun Ra contributed a poem: \u201cReality has touched against myth / Humanity can move to achieve the impossible / Because when you\u2019ve achieved one impossible others / Come together to be with their brother, the first impossible / Borrowed from the rim of the myth / Happy Space Age to you\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Space exploration inspired Ra; it seemed to be proof that humanity was destined to harness its technological potential.\nRa was far from obscure: in the late sixties, he graced the cover of Rolling Stone. In the seventies, he taught at Berkeley, performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and toured around the world. But by the time \u201cLanquidity\u201d was released Ra was becoming less optimistic about how much listeners had learned from his work. He was often treated as an eccentric, and his theatrical dress frequently overshadowed his prowess as a composer. In a lecture that he delivered in New York, he reiterated his lack of interest in making music about \u201cEarth things.\u201d He riffed on Iran, the threat of nuclear warfare, the fact that young people seemed uninterested in cosmic salvation. \u201cFor a long time, the world has dwelt on faith, beliefs, possibly dreams, and the truth. And the kind of world you\u2019ve got today is based on those particular things. How do you like it?\u201d\nWe are always rediscovering Sun Ra\u2014though he would probably prefer that we spend our time musing on the future rather than on the past. In 2020, Strut released a compilation called \u201cEgypt 1971\u201d that explored the music Ra recorded while touring there. Last spring, Duke University republished John Szwed\u2019s definitive 1997 biography, \u201cSpace Is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra.\u201d Last December, the first in a series of \u201cSun Ra Research\u201d films was released. It was the culmination of decades of work by two obsessive fans, Peter and John Hinds, who self-published a Ra-centric zine in the nineties. The film is an absorbing collage of Arkestra performances interspersed with long, meandering interviews, and footage of Ra doing mundane things like answering the phone or checking into a hotel. The Arkestra, which is now led by Ra\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Marshall Allen, who is ninety-seven, still goes on tour. Last year, the group released a set of new recordings of Arkestra classics, titled \u201cSwirling.\u201d During the pandemic, Allen and the Arkestra streamed a benefit concert hosted by Total Luxury Spa, a Black-owned streetwear brand in Los Angeles, which has been influenced by Ra\u2019s ideas and iconography.\nEach time Ra is rediscovered, his reception reflects what his listeners crave. When I was first introduced to Ra, in the early nineties, he was presented as an oddball with a good backstory\u2014a precursor to the \u201calternative\u201d music of the day. Today, in the midst of overlapping global crises, Ra asks us to believe in the impossible. This spring, the Chicago gallery and publisher Corbett vs. Dempsey reproduced a series of Sun Ra poetry booklets: \u201cJazz by Sun Ra,\u201d \u201cJazz in Silhouette,\u201d and \u201cThe Immeasurable Equation.\u201d As with his fifties broadsheets, these writings capture a rawness and directness distinct from his experimental music. In one poem, he implores Black youth to never feel unloved: \u201cI am your unknown friend.\u201d He is always there, in the past and in the future, ready to be found by his listeners. In another booklet, originally published in 1957, he explains that his music is, at root, about \u201chappiness.\u201d Maybe people don\u2019t recognize these new forms of joy quite yet. But, he writes, \u201ceventually I will succeed.\u201d\u00a0\u2666\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.\n\u00a9 2021 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Thanks for posting.\nI love the exploration of space and the quest to find life elsewhere but I believe that life can only exist under conditions that are unique to Earth. It\u2019s too dang violent and harsh out there in space.\nGod only made one planet for humans. They are waiting money looking for life elsewhere\nAskin\u2019 for a friend....\nno. certainly no intelligent life\nYou may be more correct than you think. Complex beings like humans are really made up of trillions of cells that have evolved to communicate through ion channels to organize into organs and tissue. Research indicates that this organization is controlled by a feedback loop between an evolved abstract \u201csoftware\u201d model of what a \u201ccorrect\u201d human body should be and the physical protein \u201chardware\u201d generated by cells that grows and connects until it duplicates the model and stops.\nThe problem is no one has identified what the \u201cbits\u201d of the model memory are made of. If they were electrical or magnetic like a computer\u2019s they would be destroyed by MRI machines or high voltage fields but they aren\u2019t.\nOne possibility is that the patterns evolved from simpler to more complex structures over billion of years in growing populations of replicating organisms. These energy patterns curve the metric of space time the same way that ordinary mass-energy does (see Einsteins GR laws) and create slight gradients that influence the motion of ion channels in future organisms as they mature.\nThe more organisms that survive over time the larger the number of identical patterns and the deeper and more influential the curvature becomes until they are the default shape of all organisms of a certain species.\nIf this is found to be the correct explanation it would mean that life forms could not thrive and reproduce at long distance from their point of evolution since the ability of the space time curvature model to correctly organize the organism would diminish like gravity does with distance. This might also explain why alien beings can\u2019t travel long distances in space unless they bring large populations of their species with them.\nI watched NASA\u2019s string of shows on this.

Instead, it\u2019s more of a minor step forward that fixes a few of the Switch\u2019s original design flaws, but doesn\u2019t dramatically change the system. And you know what? That\u2019s fine.\nIf you\u2019ve been following Nintendo for any amount of time, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the company isn\u2019t really interested in joining a spcs race. Let Sony and Microsoft duke it out for 4K dominance \u2014 Nintendo can show there\u2019s still plenty to love about games in 1080p and below. Sticking with the same hardware also means developers don\u2019t have to worry about splitting the Switch user base, an issue that\u2019s plagued Nintendo systems over the last few decades. (Was the New 3DS actually worth it?)\nThe global chip shortage may have foiled Nintendo\u2019s plans to stuff better hardware in this Switch, as well. The system currently uses a custom version of NVIDIA\u2019s Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, which was quietly updated in 2019 to increase the console\u2019s battery life. According to various reports, Nintendo was exploring docked 4K upscaling using NVIDIA\u2019s DLSS technology, which uses AI processing to bump lower-resolution textures up to something that looks far sharper. But that technology would have required an updated Tegra chip that brought over some of the hardware from NVIDIA\u2019s recent RTX GPUs. That\u2019s not an impossible task, but it\u2019s one that may have required more work than NVIDIA was able to accomplish during the hellscape of 2020 (at least, while keeping the final cost reasonable).\nThat doesn\u2019t mean dreams of a 4K-capable Switch are dead; it\u2019s just something we\u2019ll have to wait a year or two to see. Nintendo would also need to add more RAM to the Switch so it could better handle the 1080p textures required for DLSS upscaling. That\u2019s not easy to do with the system\u2019s meager 4GB of RAM, so a future console would need 6GB or 8GB. And don\u2019t forget, Nintendo also needs to balance delivering solid battery life with the Switch in handheld mode, so it needs to be careful about shoving in demanding new hardware.\nFor owners of the original Switch, or newcomers to the platform, this OLED model still seems like an enticing upgrade. The larger screen makes the system look more modern, with less of a chunky display bezel. OLED will also make games look dramatically better, especially while playing outside in direct sunlight. There\u2019s also a wider kickstand, similar to the one of the Microsoft Surface tablets, which should make portable play a lot more stable. There\u2019s also 64GB of internal storage, up from 32GB, and \u201cenhanced audio,\u201d which could just refer to better speakers. Nintendo isn\u2019t getting very specific there.\nAnd if you\u2019re really into online multiplayer, you\u2019ll likely appreciate the Ethernet port built into the OLED Switch\u2019s dock. (And if that\u2019s the main draw for you, Nintendo says the dock is also compatible with the old Switch models.) Due to the larger screen, though, Nintendo says the OLED Switch may run into issues with some Labo kits and other games.\nI get it, $350 is a lot to shell out for a slightly better Switch. That\u2019s particularly true when you can get the disc-less PlayStation 5 for $399, or the full PS5 and Xbox Series X for $499. But for Nintendo diehards, the improvements are definitely tempting. Just don\u2019t be surprised if the company ends up dropping the 4K-capable Switch during the 2022 holiday season."

                    "value": "Four years after unleashing the Switch upon the world, Nintendo is releasing an upgraded version of its phenomenally successful console. After years of rumors, the company has at last confirmed the existence of a new Switch model with an OLED display. It'll cost $349.99 and arrive on October 8th.\nAs expected, the latest model has a larger, seven-inch screen. The 720p OLED display, which Nintendo claims is more vivid, is a step up from the 6.2-inch LCD screen on the original Switch. The console has significantly reduced bezels and 64GB of storage, while the dock has a wired LAN port.\nNintendo is promising \"enhanced audio\" with the new Switch, which works with all existing Joy-Con controllers. The company is offering it in the traditional neon red/blue color scheme with a black dock, or in a white/black color scheme with a white dock.\nThe new Switch also has what looks like a massively improved kickstand that spans the entire width of the back of the console. It can be propped up at any angle and looks far sturdier than the tiny, fragile piece of plastic that propped up the old Switch.\nHowever, there's no 4K output while docked, as reports had widely suggested. You'll still only play at a maximum resolution of 1080p on your TV. Nor is Nintendo upgrading any other internal components. The OLED device was rumored to have a new chipset with support for NVIDIA's DLSS upscaling tech, but that's not the case this time around. The company also warned that tweaks such as the larger screen mean the new Switch might not work as neatly with Nintendo Labo products.\nThe original Switch is still selling like hot cakes, so there\u2019s a case to be made that Nintendo didn't need to upgrade the console just yet. But the original Switch's display and huge bezels are starting to look a little bit dated in 2021; this OLED screen should modernize the experience significantly. That said, for people who want to save some cash, Nintendo will continue selling the original Switch, at least for now.\nIt's highly likely that demand will far exceed supply. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors in a call in May that the company was still contending with shortages and production issues. The current global scarcity of semiconductors will also limit production capacity. So, the new Switch might be even harder to find than the current console has been at various points.\nSince it released the original Switch in 2017, Nintendo has issued a revised model with a battery upgrade. It also released the handheld-only Switch Lite in 2019. Two years later, moving in the other direction with an upgraded Switch is a logical move. Good luck getting your hands on one any time soon, though."

Still, the OLED Switch is the most grown-up-looking Switch so far, with smaller bezels, a new off-white dock and matching Joy-Cons. The core upgrade is \u2014 shockingly \u2014 the screen: a new seven-inch OLED panel that should offer crisper graphics when played as a handheld. However, the resolution hasn\u2019t changed, so it\u2019s been stretched a little wider than the original 6.2-inch LCD Switch.\nI can run through the rest of the changes, as there aren\u2019t all that many. There\u2019s now 64GB of internal storage \u2014 another grown-up upgrade \u2014 while a wider, more solid-looking kickstand replaces the flimsy plastic tab on the original Switch. You can adjust this to multiple angles for more comfortable table-top / airplane-tray-table gaming. The new off-white dock also has an Ethernet port built-in, while the core OLED Switch has improved speakers. Otherwise, there\u2019s no newer processor and, seemingly, no battery-life improvements. (The company hasn\u2019t offered any battery estimates yet on its official site.)\nThe OLED Switch is not for current Switch owners looking to upgrade \u2014 although I don\u2019t doubt some of us will buy one. It\u2019s a refined version of the original (or maybe I\u2019m easily tricked by monochrome color schemes), but seems expressly aimed at handheld players, who are the ones that\u2019ll benefit from the bigger OLED screen. That\u2019s odd when the cheaper, non-hybrid Switch Lite was geared at the same crowd.\nNintendo could have squashed the more aggressive rumors of a powerful version capable of 4K and upscaled gaming, but it didn\u2019t. Because it\u2019s Nintendo, meaning it has a mercurial vision for hybrid consoles, iconic games, detachable controls and, at the same time, ignores Bluetooth audio support and in-game chat functionality. And there was no mention of any changes to fix Joy-Con drift.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a comparison from console history, consider this a GameBoy Pocket-style twist on the GameBoy, rather than a more powerful PS4 Pro to replace the PS4.\nAnd will we ever see the 4K-capable Switch Pro?

Now that the shock has started to wear off, I have to ask: Is this the upgraded Switch any of us really wanted?\nAt a quick glance, forking out an extra $50 for a more colorful OLED display and some other minor improvements compared to the standard model seems like a good deal, especially for any first-time Switch buyers. However, if you look a little closer, the new OLED Switch isn\u2019t exactly the premium gaming console that a lot of gamers may have been hoping for. So let\u2019s break it down.\nAnd that\u2019s about it. Yes, the OLED Switch will be backwards compatible with all previous Switch games, aside from some potential issues with Nintendo Labo due to the OLED Switch being 0.1 inches longer. Nintendo has also confirmed that the OLED Switch will work with existing Switch docks. The company said the performance and battery life of the OLED Switch will be the same as the standard model.\nHowever, there are also a lot of features (including some things that have become industry standards) that you still don\u2019t get on Nintendo\u2019s flagship console.\nSo it seems that what we\u2019re really getting is more of a Switch refresh than a true \u201cSwitch Pro,\u201d to the point where I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the standard model gets discontinued in a year or two.\nLet us know what you think in the comments\u2014there\u2019s always a lot to talk about when a new Nintendo hits the streets, and we want to hear it.\nSenior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

Namely, it's missing a new chipset that bumps up the processing power above what's available on existing Switch hardware.\nThat lack of improved internals is surprising mainly because of a number of reports that promised the next Switch would support a bump to \"4K graphics when paired with TVs,\" as Bloomberg phrased it is as recently as March. Bloomberg's reporters tend to be reliable when it comes to this kind of insider Nintendo reporting, including an early 2019 report that predicted a \"lower-priced\" Nintendo Switch Lite months ahead of its announcement. Bloomberg also got the other details right about the OLED Model, including the 7\" OLED screen that maintains the original Switch's 720p resolution and the general timing of when manufacturing would begin.\nThat theory would line up with the worldwide semiconductor shortage that has plagued the global supply chain in recent months. That's the same shortage that Sony and Microsoft have already admitted could limit supplies of their next-generation consoles through the end of the year, suggesting that Nintendo probably isn't immune to the same forces.\nAs the extent of those shortages became clear in recent months, Nintendo may have been faced with two options. The industry giant could delay its \"Switch Pro\" plans until the chips it needed for a more powerful system were available at an acceptable cost (likely meaning pushing back to a 2022 launch). Or it could scale back its plans, make use of readily available OLED screens, and launch a more limited redesign that kept the same basic internal hardware architecture in time for the 2021 holidays.\nI don't have access to Nintendo's decision process here, so the actual considerations may have looked very different. But these kinds of changing circumstances would provide a plausible explanation for why expectations and early reporting on a \"Switch Pro\" didn't match reality in this case.\nEven when the Switch launched in 2017, it was underpowered compared to its console competition. Now that the console is quickly approaching its fifth anniversary, its raw hardware power is absolutely dwarfed by fully 4K systems like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nHere's the thing, though: there's no real evidence that's a problem for Nintendo.\nDespite the lack of power, the Switch is still selling extremely well, pushing nearly 29 million systems worldwide in the last fiscal year. Bloomberg's Takashi Mochizuki points out that it is currently on track to sell 100 million units faster than any other home console (though portable systems like the Nintendo DS sold even faster)\nThose kinds of sales numbers don't suggest an immediate need for a midgeneration power-boosting redesign. The system's mix of first-party exclusives, a wide range of indie and third-party titles, and a hybrid portable/TV form factor is obviously still a hit with gaming audiences, even without the raw hardware power of the competition.\nSure, Switch owners miss out on some high-end blockbusters that require the latest-and-greatest processors to power their worlds. But some publishers are working around those limitations with visually downgraded ports or even streaming options that run high-end games on powerful remote servers.\nMaybe this kind of internal power upgrade (and maybe a resolution-bump for the Switch's screen?) are still a possibility for a more full-fledged \"Switch Pro\" update in coming years. But there's nothing to suggest that any of these features are necessary to keep the Switch relevant in today's gaming market.\nThe value proposition of the OLED Model Switch is very different depending on how you use the system. When compared to the standard $300 Switch model, players who use the OLED Model away from the TV get an improved screen, improved speakers, and a heavily upgraded kickstand for \"tabletop\" play. OLED Model players who use the Switch while connected to the TV, on the other hand, get... a better-looking dock with a wired Ethernet port (both sets of players also get more internal storage).\nThat contrast helps cement a general impression that we've had ever since the release of the Switch Lite in 2019; Nintendo seems to be putting more emphasis on the Switch as a portable system than as a TV-based console these days. That's at least a little surprising considering that, as recently as 2018, Nintendo was saying that docked and undocked playtime for the Switch was \"about even\" across all players.\nMaybe that split has changed in the intervening years. Or maybe Nintendo has simply decided to lean into the portable experience as the Switch's key differentiator from its more powerful console competition. Either way, Nintendo apparently sees the Switch as a portable system that can optionally be plugged into a TV, rather than the other way around (and despite what Nintendo told Polygon in 2016, when the 3DS still provided Nintendo's portable hardware focus).\nEven for portable users, the OLED Model's small improvements over previous Switch hardware might make it hard for existing Switch owners to justify spending a full $350 on an upgrade. But if you're one of the millions of people who will be in the market for their first Switch this holiday season, a $50 relative price difference for those same improvements might not seem so ridiculous.\nKeep in mind that households purchasing their first Switch still accounted for 80 percent of the console's worldwide sales in the fiscal year that just ended in March. That's roughly 23 million of the roughly 29 million consoles Nintendo sold in the 12-month period\u2014numbers that help explain who Nintendo probably sees as the core audience for this slightly improved top-end Switch model.\nIn any case, the old $300 Switch and the $200 Switch Lite aren't going anywhere for the time being. And the new model plays the same games and uses the same controllers that already exist, meaning it won't split the Switch hardware or accessories market in any meaningful way. That makes the OLED Model a relatively risk-free way for Nintendo to introduce a \"high-end\" Switch (with a bit of a high-end price point) without being too disruptive to what's obviously working well so far.\nYou must login or create an account to comment.\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox."

                    "value": "Commentary: Nintendo's updated Switch can't output in 4K, won't have better graphics or improved battery life. It'll still sell in the millions.\n\"I need the TLDR,\" a friend texted me in June. \"Should I wait to buy a Nintendo Switch?\"\nWanting to secure a birthday surprise for her boyfriend, she had done some Googling and discovered the upcoming existence of a newer, better device. I told her the new model might be called the Switch Pro, might support 4K and might be worth waiting for.\nNot so. The new model doesn't support 4K, and it's not called the Switch Pro. Actually, I don't know what it's called. Switch OLED? Switch with OLED? Regardless, as the name -- whatever it is -- suggests, its main improvement is the OLED display.\nIt'll be 0.8-inches bigger than the regular Switch's 6.2-inch screen, with deeper blacks and better contrast. Other touted features include an improved kickstand and \"enhanced audio.\" In other words, it's anything but a generational leap. These modest improvements come with a modest price hike. The Switch Deluxe launches at $350 on Oct. 8, at just $50 more than the Non OLED Switch.\nThat seems fair, but the online reaction hasn't been kind. That's because, like me, it appears most people anticipated more. An upgraded Nintendo Switch was first reported by Bloomberg some 11 months ago -- long enough for imaginations flourish and expectations to soar.\nComing in September! Nintendo Switch CRT version! @NeonNinja225 pic.twitter.com/aJgBBXgbIa\nNintendo Switch vs Nintendo Switch OLED pic.twitter.com/2G5HJwOsky\nAnd those inflated expectations are the issue here -- not the New and Slightly Improved Switch. If it was a surprise announcement, gamers would have met the new edition with a polite \"fair enough.\" It's only against hopes of substantial hardware improvements, and existing owners wanting a decent reason to upgrade, that the reaction becomes \"Nintendo ruined everything again!\"\nDon't get me wrong. If I had it my way, Nintendo would have announced a Switch Pro with 4K resolution, a new graphics chip and better battery life. I'd also fix the ongoing drift issues with the console's Joy-Cons, and its lack of native bluetooth support -- which is absurd at this point. But with the Nintendo SWOLED, Nintendo isn't trying to get my dollar. There are millions of people who care about 4K gaming, but there are billions who play games that don't.\nNintendo cares about that second group.\nThe NintendOLED Switch makes sense for a few reasons.\nFirst, Nintendo isn't yet interested in the Switch 2 or anything resembling a next-generation console. Doug Bowser, Nintendo America's hilariously named president, told Polygon in December that we're at around the \"midpoint\" of the Switch's lifecycle. Since the Switch has sold more units each year -- 15 million in 2017's financial year, 17 million in 2018, 20 million in 2019, 26 million in 2020 -- Nintendo rightly sees that it doesn't need to do anything drastic with the console's hardware. A gentle nudge, like a bigger and clearer display, should keep the money flowing.\nThis is the company's modus operandi. Do you remember the 3DS XL, the DS Lite, and the Game Boy Advance SP? Of course you do! They were awesome. But don't forget the 2DS, the 2DS XL, the DSi, DSi XL, the backlit Game Boy Advance SP and the Game Boy Advance Micro -- which Nintendo released almost a year after the original DS.\n\"Extend Console Lifespan with Iterative Models\" isn't catchy, but it's the name of the game.\nLike all of the aforementioned renovated models, the OLED Switch has two goals. It serves diehard fans, numbering in the millions, who flock to buy any new Nintendo console. Second, and more importantly, it provides an extra option to people who haven't bought a Switch yet.\nThe console has sold over 84 million units since 2017, about 16 million shy of becoming the best-selling Nintendo home console ever. But the company isn't scraping the barrel for more buys, as there are hundreds of millions of potential sales yet to be realized, and it's these to whom Nintendo are appealing by adding to the Switch hardware range. It's a push for those who've been on the fence since 2017, or those who have rekindled their love of gaming during the pandemic. It'll also help build hype for Metroid Dread, which launches on the same day.\nSo horribly disappointed with the new Nintendo Switch OLED specs & lack of improvements. Anyone know where I can preorder?\n3+ million views on YouTube already for Switch OLED, 156k Likes, 91% Like Ratio and #1 Trending all dayWhile this isn't getting received super well in the hardcore gaming community there seems to a be a lot more positive sentiment and interest among the general audience pic.twitter.com/VzxS9hzPsZ\nThe company's calculus appears as follows: Switch OLED + Metroid Dead x holiday sales multiplier = a Merry Christmas for Nintendo. I suspect the math will check out.\nNintendo has always prized accessibility over technical prowess, which is how the Wii, DS and 3DS all became huge successes. I suspect Nintendo will eventually create a 4K-capable console when it can do so cheaply enough to sell it for under $400 -- by which time Sony and Microsoft will already be onto 8K.\nIt's not a bad strategy. When my friend texted me for Switch advice -- something she's unlikely to do ever again -- she decided against waiting to buy her partner a newer, more powerful Switch.\n\"Do you have a 4K TV? Does he care about 4K graphics?,\" I asked. \"We do,\" she answered, \"he doesn't.\""

Say hello to Nintendo\u2019s OLED Switch. Or the Nintendo Switch (OLED model) if you prefer dumb names.\nThat\u2019s right you beautiful people, a new Nintendo Switch will be hitting the shelves on October 8. It will come with a 7-inch OLED screen (YES!) and has a recommended retail price of $350 (OKAY!).\nBut you know what? I\u2019m so excited I\u2019m currently sitting here in a little puddle of pee. I\u00a0love the Nintendo Switch, and I can\u2019t wait to get my grubby little mitts on this OLED model.\nLet\u2019s talk about some new shit though.\nAs you can see above (and below), one of the new elements in the OLED Switch is a\u00a0~ w i d e ~ adjustable stand. This will be a godsend for anyone who has struggled with the filmsy thing on the old Switch. In other words, everyone. Forever.\nOn top of this, the OLED Switch will come with a dock with a wired LAN port (great for online gaming) and 64GB of internal storage (not so great for gaming).\nThe other exciting update is the color: damn, that white/grey looks slick as fuck. You can also get the OLED Switch in the neon red and blue as previous editions, but\u2026 why? Have you seen the video? How badass the new color looks?\nIs the OLED Switch everything I could\u2019ve wanted? Hmm, probably not. It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no 4K support. In fact, it\u2019s downright confusing there\u2019s no 4K support. The OLED screen will deliver crisper visuals, but the resolution remains the same as the old Nintendo Switch. Both in handheld and TV mode.\nIt also appears that the OLED Switch has the same battery life as the original version. Which is\u2026 confusing?\nReally, this isn\u2019t a Pro Switch at all, it\u2019s simply the previous Switch in a new color with a fancy screen.

It has a bigger and better screen, ethernet compatibility, and improved speakers. It features a wider, adjustable kickstand, and it doubles internal storage to 64 GB. It even comes in a panda color. These are all welcome improvements, and my colleague Callum, at least, is rather excited about it.\nAnd I would be too\u2026 if it weren\u2019t for the fact I still want an honest-to-goodness Switch Pro. Luckily, there\u2019s still hope.\nRumors of a 4K Switch have been floating around for ages, and not just from the \u201cmy uncle works at Nintendo\u201d type. Reliable sources have pointed to a 4K Switch in enough detail that the only reasonable explanation \u2014 other than \u201cNintendo is trolling the leakers\u201d \u2014 is that Nintendo is waiting for the right time to release it.\nIt just hasn\u2019t been the right time yet. But you know what is the right time? Zelda time. It seems increasingly likely Nintendo is simply going to release the new Switch roughly alongside the sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, better known as Breath of the Wild 2.\nIt\u2019s possible, if not likely, that Nintendo had a different timeline for a more powerful Switch before this whole global pandemic thing happened. But as it stands, it would simply make no sense at all to release a Switch Pro without a flagship title to accompany it.\nThe Nintendo Switch is still selling like hotcakes in its good ol\u2019 1080p form, after all. In fact, as noted by Bloomberg, the Switch is on track to become the fastest console to ever sell 100 million units.\nalso:https://t.co/Yx8M5Gqe1zpic.twitter.com/cb6NY55CoF\nThe Switch and Switch Lite had enough momentum on their own to get to their current numbers. And despite the fact that Nintendo arguably hasn\u2019t released a main title from one of its flagship IPs since 2018\u2019s Smash Bros. Ultimate, Switch sales are showing no signs of slowing down.\nThe Switch OLED\u2019s launch, coinciding with October\u2019s Metroid Dread, will likely be just enough of a kick to maintain that momentum into 2022. This is what Nintendo always does after all; it releases iterative tweaks on its consoles to revamp sales. Need I remind you of how many versions of the 3DS there were?\nBut as excited as I am for a new Metroid, it\u2019s still a bit more of a niche series than Mario and Zelda. That Nintendo would want to save its big guns for Breath of the Wild 2 seems like a no-brainer to me.\nI\u2019m not the type of gamer that cares tremendously about graphics horsepower. I\u2019m a Nintendo fan, after all, and the company abandoned the polygon race after the GameCube.\u00a0 But I wouldn\u2019t mind playing Breath of the Wild 2 with some added visual fidelity, and I\u2019d be willing to bet a few silver rupees that Nintendo is banking on other Zelda fans that feel the same.\nTNW is a Financial Times company."

                    "value": "Yesterday, Nintendo announced a new Switch,\u00a0the OLED model. There\u2019s a problem though: this isn\u2019t the Pro version of the console that many people were after.\nThis puts lots of us in the strange situation of being unsure whether to be excited or not. Is the OLED model worth it? Just how different is it to the original Nintendo Switch?\nLuckily for you, we\u2019re here to solve those questions\u2026 with math. And graphs. Math and graphs. Graphs and math. HERE WE GO.\nLet\u2019s get the most obvious improvement out the way first: the screen. Let\u2019s have a look at the different sizes:\nNothing too odd here. The Nintendo Switch has a 6.2-inch LCD, while the OLED model has a 7-inch, uh, OLED screen. This is a 12.9% increase in the diagonal screen size between the two models.\nBut what about the\u00a0screen area? Well, the OG Nintendo with the 6.2-inch has a display area of 106cm\u00b2. The 7-inch OLED screen clocks in at 136cm\u00b2. That then, is a\u00a027.3% increase\u00a0in the display area between the two models. Which is quite a lot tbh.\nThe resolution of both displays on the console has stayed the same though:\u00a01280 x 720. Or 720p. This means that while the OLED model will have\u00a0better contrast, higher brightness, and a wider color range, it\u00a0won\u2019t have more detail than the original Switch.\nWhich is a crying shame.\nBut let\u2019s look at something else in the\u00a0Nintendo Switch vs. OLED model fight. Specifically,\u00a0weight:\nAs you can see, the OLED model is\u00a023 grams heavier than the original Nintendo Switch. That\u2019s roughly the same weight as an AA battery, or a\u00a07.7% weight increase.\nBut here\u2019s where we bump into something strange.\nBoth the original Switch and OLED model have the same CPU/GPU (a NVIDIA customised Tegra processor)\u00a0and the same capacity battery (4,310mAh). This suggests that most of that extra weight is down to the screen.\nWhile we\u2019re doing a\u00a0Nintendo Switch vs. OLED model battle, we can also approximate the volumes of each device. The regular Switch clocks in at\u00a0338cm\u00b3, while the OLED model has a volume of 343cm\u00b3.\nThat\u2019s a 1.3% increase in volume between the models. Not a huge amount, but enough that some of Nintendo\u2019s LABO hardware may not fit as snugly as users like.\nLet\u2019s finish this comparison of the\u00a0Nintendo Switch and OLED model with a final graph. This one is looking at the system memory of both models:\nEven though, I\u2019d say the average size of a AAA game is around 10GB \u2014 meaning you can only get around 6 of them on the new OLED model. Still, that\u2019s better than a kick in the teeth.\nAll the data in this article was pulled from Nintendo\u2019s official site.\nThe most important element is this: the OLED model is not a Pro Switch. Not even close. It\u2019s barely an upgrade from the original console, with only the screen being a substantial departure.\nWhile the increased internal storage of the OLED model is a positive step, it feels strange that Nintendo hasn\u2019t even increased the battery size or allowed for 4K output while docked.\nI understand that it\u2019s probably holding back some of these features for the Pro, but it would\u2019ve been nice to see a Nintendo Switch V2. Instead, it feels the OLED model is a V1.1 \u2014 which is a bit of a shame considering the console is now 4 years old.\nThanks, math and graphs, you\u2019ve made me sad.\nTNW is a Financial Times company."

A pesar de que se esperaba que la nueva consola de Nintendo fuese un modelo \"Pro\" con pantalla OLED y soporte para 4K, lo cierto es que no ha sido as\u00ed. El nuevo modelo es descafeinado y, en pocas palabras, supone una evoluci\u00f3n relativamente justa.\nA continuaci\u00f3n vamos a repasar las principales diferencias entre la Nintendo Switch est\u00e1ndar (la no-Lite) y la nueva Nintendo Switch (OLED), una consola que, simplemente, pone sobre la mesa una pantalla OLED, un altavoz mejorado, un soporte ajustable y una base para la tele con puerto Ethernet, pero poco m\u00e1s.\nResoluci\u00f3n HD (1.280 x 720 p\u00edxeles)\nResoluci\u00f3n HD (1.280 x 720 p\u00edxeles)\nBluetooth 4.1\nBluetooth 4.1\nResoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima: 1.920 x 1.080 px, 60 FPS\nResoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima: 1.920 x 1.080 px, 60 FPS\nCompatible con PCM lineal 5.1\nCompatible con PCM lineal 5.1\n4.310 mAh\n4.310 mAh\nLa Nintendo Switch (OLED) es una Nintendo Switch con una pantalla m\u00e1s grande y un par de mejoras, pero a efectos pr\u00e1cticos es la misma consola. Tanto es as\u00ed que la Nintendo Switch (OLED) es compatible con los Joy-Con de la versi\u00f3n est\u00e1ndar y con sus juegos. Vamos, que si tienes juegos de Switch podr\u00e1s usarlos en la Switch (OLED).\nEl nuevo modelo es ligeramente m\u00e1s pesado, con 420 gramos de peso con los Joy-Con puestos frente a los 398 gramos de la Switch base. La compa\u00f1\u00eda ha implementado una pantalla OLED, algo que se esperaba, y ha aumentado su tama\u00f1o hasta las siete pulgadas. Sin embargo, la resoluci\u00f3n sigue siendo la misma: HD (1.280 x 720 p\u00edxeles).\nLas ventajas de la tecnolog\u00eda OLED son, b\u00e1sicamente, que ofrecen colores m\u00e1s vivos, negros m\u00e1s puros y mucho mejor contraste que los paneles IPS convencionales. No obstante, tambi\u00e9n tienen sus desventajas, como la posible aparici\u00f3n de zonas quemadas a largo plazo. Eso es debido a que los paneles OLED usan compuestos org\u00e1nicos que son m\u00e1s propensos a sufrir degradaci\u00f3n y retenci\u00f3n de imagen.\nPor otro lado, una mejora interesante es la implementaci\u00f3n de un soporte ajustable. Esta era una de las grandes quejas de los usuarios (y el que escribo esto lo suscribe como usuario de Switch), y es que la Nintendo Switch en modo sobremesa solo se puede colocar en una posici\u00f3n. La Nintendo Switch (OLED), sin embargo, se puede colocar en diferentes posiciones, lo que deber\u00eda hacer m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo jugar multijugador en local, por ejemplo.\nOtro cambio lo encontramos en los altavoces, otra queja frecuente de los usuarios. La Switch (OLED) sigue conservando los altavoces est\u00e9reo, pero ahora Nintendo afirma haber optimizado el audio para que sea de mejor calidad cuando juguemos en modo sobremesa y port\u00e1til. Habr\u00e1 que esperar hasta el 8 de octubre para ver c\u00f3mo se comportan.\nEl pen\u00faltimo cambio importante est\u00e1 en la base para jugar en la televisi\u00f3n: ahora tiene puerto Ethernet integrado para jugar en l\u00ednea. El modelo anterior tambi\u00e9n era compatible, pero mediante un accesorio opcional que se deb\u00eda comprar aparte. Ahora el puerto Ethernet est\u00e1 integrado en la base y, en principio, deber\u00eda ofrecer una experiencia m\u00e1s estable jugando en l\u00ednea.\nFinalmente, toca hablar del almacenamiento interno. Si la Nintendo Switch montaba 32 GB de almacenamiento interno de los que 6,2 GB estaban reservados para el sistema operativo, la Nintendo Switch (OLED) sube hasta los 64 GB. Es el doble y seguramente sea un cambio bien recibido por los que gustan de tener varios juegos instalados en la consola.\nPero eso es todo. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del cambio de tecnolog\u00eda de pantalla y el tama\u00f1o, el soporte ajustable, el doble de almacenamiento interno y la base con Ethernet, la Nintendo Switch (OLED) no deja de ser una Nintendo Switch ligeramente vitaminada. Una evoluci\u00f3n sutil que cuadra con la estrategia de Nintendo, pero que se queda corta en cuanto a potencia.\nPor un lado, la pantalla OLED de siete pulgadas conserva la resoluci\u00f3n HD (1.280 x 720 p\u00edxeles), por lo que la densidad de p\u00edxeles por pulgada de la nueva consola de Nintendo ser\u00e1 menor. Eso deber\u00eda repercutir en la calidad de imagen, que deber\u00eda ser ligeramente menor en la nueva consola.\nPor otro lado, la nueva tecnolog\u00eda y el nuevo tama\u00f1o no est\u00e1n acompa\u00f1ados de una mejora de potencia. Tanto la Nintendo Switch como la Nintendo Switch (OLED) montan un procesador NVIDIA Tegra de 2015, un procesador que sirve para los juegos actuales pero que habr\u00e1 que ver c\u00f3mo se comporta ante la llegada de t\u00edtulos como 'Leyendas Pok\u00e9mon: Arceus', el mundo abierto de Pok\u00e9mon que apunta a ser bastante exigente. Tambi\u00e9n se ha confirmado que no se ha modificado la CPU ni se ha a\u00f1adido m\u00e1s memoria RAM.\nB\u00e1sicamente, la Nintendo Switch es, sobre el papel, igual de potente que la generaci\u00f3n anterior, lo cual explica que no tenga salida de v\u00eddeo en 4K, algo que tambi\u00e9n se esperaba. Quiz\u00e1 no sea la \u00faltima consola que veamos este a\u00f1o (los rumores apuntaban a una presentaci\u00f3n en septiembre), pero ser\u00eda extra\u00f1o que Nintendo lanzase nuevo hardware este a\u00f1o. No obstante, en febrero dijeron que no habr\u00eda m\u00e1s modelos pronto y aqu\u00ed estamos, hablando de la Switch (OLED).\nTampoco hay mejoras en la autonom\u00eda. Las cifras oficiales son de entre 4,5 y 9 horas de autonom\u00eda, con 5,5 horas jugando a 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild'. Es la misma cifra que la consola original. Tampoco se ha mejorado la velocidad de carga, que sigue siendo de tres horas.\nLo m\u00e1s interesante de todo es que no importa porque Nintendo nunca ha querido entrar en la guerra de consolas. Nintendo sabe que su consola funciona y que sus juegos first-party funcionan. Para Nintendo no es una cuesti\u00f3n de mejor hardware, sino de sacar juegos para su hardware, y esa estrategia le ha funcionado siempre: 84,59 millones de consolas vendidas lo avalan.\nEn Xataka hablamos de..."

No obstante, las filtraciones no fueron certeras.\nLa Nintendo Switch OLED destaca, principalmente, por incorporar una pantalla OLED de 7 pulgadas. El modelo est\u00e1ndar es LCD de 6,2\", por lo que el aumento en dimensiones es considerable. Eso s\u00ed, mantiene su resoluci\u00f3n 720p (1280 x 720 pixeles). El almacenamiento interno aument\u00f3 de 32 a 64 GB, mientras que la bater\u00eda promete hasta 9 horas de autonom\u00eda.\nEn la parte posterior podr\u00e1s encontrar un nuevo soporte ajustable al estilo Microsoft Surface. Respecto al Dock, ahora integra el tan deseado puerto Ethernet, lo cual beneficiar\u00e1 tu experiencia en juegos en l\u00ednea (cuando est\u00e1 conectada a la TV).\nLa decepci\u00f3n que rodea actualmente a la Nintendo Switch OLED es un buen ejemplo de que cualquier filtraci\u00f3n o reporte, por m\u00e1s confiable que sea su fuente, debe tomarse con pinzas.\nEstamos m\u00e1s ocupados que nunca y hay demasiada informaci\u00f3n, lo sabemos.

La nueva consola port\u00e1til de la corporaci\u00f3n japonesa llegar\u00e1 al mercado en octubre, dotada con una pantalla OLED de 7 pulgadas, m\u00e1s almacenamiento y mejores altavoces. Sin embargo, la gran decepci\u00f3n es la falta de soporte para jugar en 4K, como se hab\u00eda rumoreado en los \u00faltimos meses.\nOtra de las novedades interesantes del nuevo dispositivo est\u00e1 en su Dock. La base de la Nintendo Switch OLED ha recibido un leve cambio est\u00e9tico, con bordes m\u00e1s redondeados y disponible en color blanco. Pero tambi\u00e9n incorpora una caracter\u00edstica importante: un puerto Ethernet para contar con conexi\u00f3n a internet cableada al jugar en Modo TV.\nDe acuerdo con Digitimes, el nuevo Dock no ser\u00e1 exclusivo de la Switch OLED, ya que Nintendo tambi\u00e9n planea venderlo individualmente. As\u00ed, los usuarios que deseen continuar con la Switch original podr\u00e1n adquirir la base de la nueva consola port\u00e1til, aunque solo sea para sacarle jugo al puerto RJ45.\nTodav\u00eda no se sabe cu\u00e1nto costar\u00e1 el nuevo Dock de la Nintendo Switch OLED, pero el informe asegura que se vender\u00e1 sin cables. Esto significa que los usuarios deber\u00e1n reutilizar el cable HDMI y el adaptador de corriente de la versi\u00f3n original. Por otra parte, la corporaci\u00f3n japonesa planea vender el accesorio exclusivamente a trav\u00e9s de su tienda en l\u00ednea. Esto significa que la base de la consola port\u00e1til no se conseguir\u00e1 oficialmente en Amazon o plataformas similares.\nSeg\u00fan lo publicado ayer, la Nintendo Switch OLED no incorpora mejoras de CPU o de memoria RAM. Por dicho motivo, es probable que muchos jugadores opten por quedarse con la versi\u00f3n original de la consola.\nA pesar que la nueva variante del dispositivo es ligeramente m\u00e1s grande y m\u00e1s pesada que la Switch tradicional, los docks son intercambiables. De modo que, por estas horas al menos, la idea de actualizar solamente la base no suena descabellada. Mientras tanto, muchos gamers alimentan el sue\u00f1o de que Nintendo los sorprenda con una una verdadera \"Switch Pro\" a comienzos de 2022.\nEstamos m\u00e1s ocupados que nunca y hay demasiada informaci\u00f3n, lo sabemos.

Die \"Switch Pro\" k\u00f6nnte trotzdem noch kommen.\nEin OLED-Display, ein besserer Standfu\u00df und ein Ethernet-Anschluss im Dock: Die Verbesserungen der neuen Nintendo Switch klingen vor allem f\u00fcr Nintendo-Fans entt\u00e4uschend, die sich in den vergangenen Monaten der Ger\u00fcchtek\u00fcche hingegeben haben: Die f\u00fcr gew\u00f6hnlich zuverl\u00e4ssige Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg hatte immer wieder von einer \"Switch Pro\" berichtet, die dank einem neuen Nvidia-Chip 4K ausgeben kann und sogar DLSS unterst\u00fctzt.\nDas Ger\u00e4t, das Nintendo nun vorgestellt hat, ist keine Switch Pro. Es ist hochoffiziell eine \"Nintendo Switch (OLED-Modell)\", hat also nicht einmal einen raffinierten Namenszusatz bekommen. Auch die OLED-Switch bleibt mit ihrem Tegra X1 auf einem technischen Niveau, das schon zum Start der Switch im M\u00e4rz 2017 hinter damaligen Mobiltelefonen hinterherhinkte. Und ein Consumer-Ger\u00e4t, das ein OLED-Display mit fast schon antiker 720p-Aufl\u00f6sung verbindet, ist aus gutem Grund eine Rarit\u00e4t.\nDoch auch das bisherige Switch-Modell hatte diese Probleme \u2013 und geh\u00f6rt trotzdem zu den erfolgreichsten Nintendo-Konsolen aller Zeiten. Im M\u00e4rz vermeldete das japansiche Spieleunternehmen 85 Millionen verkaufte Switch-Konsolen, 29 Millionen davon alleine im Pandemie-Jahr 2020. Die Switch war in diesem Zeitraum die meistverkaufte Spielkonsole \u00fcberhaupt.\nW\u00e4hrend Xbox Series und Playstation 5 wegen Komponentenknappheit kaum zu bekommen sind, kann man die Nintendo Switch gerade ganz normal bei Amazon bestellen. Weil sich die Innereien der hybriden Spielkonsole auch beim OLED-Modell nicht \u00e4ndern werden, besteht Hoffnung, dass die schlimmsten Engp\u00e4sse an der neuen Version vorbeigehen. Alleine das w\u00fcrde die technisch bescheidene OLED-Switch begehrenswert machen. Denn was bringt eine tolle High-Tech-Konsole, die man nicht kaufen kann?\nDass Nintendo ohnehin wenig Wert auf Hammer-Grafik und hohe Bildraten legt, ist allgemein bekannt. Diese Schw\u00e4chen machen die Switch-Konsolen mit einzigartig unterhaltsamen Spielen und dem Vorteil der Mobilit\u00e4t wieder weg: Wer Blockbuster-Spiele mobil zocken m\u00f6chte, kommt an der Switch nicht vorbei. Cloud-Gaming-Dienste wie xCloud und Stadia vertragen sich schlecht mit dem mobilen Internet, auf Handys sind Gro\u00dfproduktionen ohne r\u00e4uberische Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle selten.\nNintendo tut mit der OLED-Switch au\u00dferdem den Entwicklerstudios einen Gefallen. Sie m\u00fcssen ihre Titel weiterhin nur f\u00fcr ein Hardware-Level optimieren \u2013 nicht f\u00fcr drei, wie es bei den Xbox- und Playstation-Konsolen der Fall ist. Wie der arbeitsaufwendige Spagat zwischen den technisch kaum vergleichbaren Konsolen Playstation 4, Playstation 4 Pro und Playstation 5 spektakul\u00e4r misslingen kann, hat zuletzt \u201eCyberpunk 2077\u201c demonstriert. Am Ende litten darunter die K\u00e4uferinnen und K\u00e4ufer.\nDavon abgesehen sind die Neuerungen der OLED-Switch durchaus relevant: Ein OLED-Display sieht auch in 720p-Aufl\u00f6sung h\u00fcbscher aus als ein LC-Panel, \u00fcberhaupt ist der gr\u00f6\u00dfere Bildschirm mit schlankeren R\u00e4ndern ein Mehrwert. Komfortfunktionen wie der \u00fcberarbeitete Standfu\u00df und der Ethernet-Port im Dock d\u00fcrften zu einem besseren Gesamtpaket beitragen. Das wird gen\u00fcgen, um die Nachfrage an der Switch derart hochzuhalten, dass Nintendo die Hybrid-Konsole weiterhin zum Vollpreis verkaufen kann. Die OLED-Switch k\u00f6nnte au\u00dferdem Besitzerinnen und Besitzer der rein portablen Switch Lite zum Neukauf bewegen, schreibt Videospiel-Analyst Daniel Ahmad auf Twitter.\nEine Switch Pro sollte man derweil noch nicht komplett abschreiben. Die Beliebtheit der Switch ist vor allem in ihrem einzigartigen Hybrid-Konzept aus Mobilit\u00e4t und TV-Modus begr\u00fcndet, mit dem Nintendo nach den misslungenen Wii-U-Experimenten einen Nerv getroffen hat. Gut m\u00f6glich, dass die Japaner noch \u00fcber viele Jahre mit der Switch planen. Dabei wird das Unternehmen nicht ewig am Tegra X1 festhalten k\u00f6nnen: Wenn sich die Chip-Knappheit entspannt, k\u00f6nnte auch Nintendo mit einem echten Hardware-Upgrade lieb\u00e4ugeln.\nDie erste Switch-Konsole kam mit \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\" als Verkaufstreiber auf den Markt. Der Nachfolger soll 2022 in den Handel kommen \u2013 vielleicht ja dann mit einer wirklich neuen Switch.\nDie Corona-Krise hat gezeigt, wie wichtig Administratoren f\u00fcr Unternehmen sind.

                    "value": "With today\u2019s announcement of the Nintendo Switch OLED, there are a ton of questions that need to be answered. Thankfully, the company has been forthright with details on its upcoming hardware revision. Unfortunately, it appears that the Switch OLED is missing some oft-requested features. Most notably, the Switch OLED doesn\u2019t come with a new version of its Joy-Con controllers or improved hardware.\nNintendo confirmed in a statement to Polygon today that the Joy-Cons customers will get with the Switch OLED are the same as the base model Switch\u2019s. Speaking to Polygon, a Nintendo representative said: \u201cThe Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch system (OLED model). The configuration and functionality is the same as that of the Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch system.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a bit of a surprise, considering the issue of Joy-Con drift that has plagued consumers since the Switch\u2019s release. Joy-Con drift is an issue with the controller\u2019s joysticks, which can dislodge from a neutral position and make inputs without you actually moving them. It\u2019s not an uncommon complaint to hear from Switch owners, and Nintendo\u2019s inaction on the issue, which essentially forces users to buy a new set of Joy-Con controllers, is surprising.\nJust as surprising is the lack of hardware upgrades in the Switch OLED, as confirmed by The Verge. Speaking to the outlet, a Nintendo spokesperson confirmed that the \u201cNintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models.\u201d There was some speculation on this issue, as Nintendo vaguely lists the console\u2019s CPU/GPU combo as an \u201cNvidia custom Tegra processor.\u201d That language stayed the same between the base Nintendo Switch and the OLED model, and now it\u2019s been confirmed that they are the same.\nIf it wasn\u2019t obvious, this isn\u2019t the \u201cSwitch Pro\u201d that some were hoping for. Previously, it was rumored that the mobile console\u2019s next hardware revision would come with vastly improved performance, boasting 4K resolutions while docked and support for Nvidia\u2019s DLSS upscaling tech.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.\nCopyright \u00a92021 Designtechnica Corporation.

                    "value": "This week, Nintendo announced a new model of its Switch console. The updated console features an OLED screen, a new dock with a hardwired Ethernet port, and a sleek white finish. However, the Joy-cons and CPU haven\u2019t been improved, contrary to early reporting about the supposed Switch \u201cPro,\u201d leaving fans wondering who and what this new system is for.\nOne questionable addition to the console is the hardwired Ethernet port on the new dock. The Nintendo Switch and its widely available Ethernet adapter add-on were released four years ago on March 3, 2017. The games that pushed players to purchase this peripheral such as Splatoon 2,\u00a0Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and\u00a0Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have also been available for quite some time now. It\u2019s likely that serious competitive players have already spring for that adapter at this point in the Switch\u2019s life cycle.\nA hardwired LAN option is a nice extra for new players, but it doesn\u2019t address technology hurdles like poor netcode that have hindered the Switch online experience since 2017. The fact of the matter is that no hardwired Ethernet will fix the console\u2019s online issue.\nNetcode is the framework of the network of online video games. There is a multitude of different kinds of netcode with Nintendo currently being known to use two.\nThe first is \u201cpia,\u201d a network based on a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d build. As explained by Oatmealdome, this means each Nintendo Switch console directly interacts with one another to provide networking. This type of netcode is used in\u00a0Splatoon 2,\u00a0Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,\u00a0Arms, and the\u00a0Nintendo Entertainment System Online titles.\nThe second is the archaic, delay-based netcode \u2014 a very infamous network build among fighting game players. This netcode delays player inputs to match networking conditions. This makes it hard to consistently react and generally input commands thanks to fluctuating online environments. This code is most notably used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\nSince the release of the Switch, many pro and casual players immediately pushed for everyone to adopt an Ethernet cable and adapter in order to shoot for the best online experiences possible. Thanks to Nintendo\u2019s decades-old networking choices, getting a consistent online experience is extremely difficult. In fact, the poor quality of the netcode for a game like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate makes it play much differently than how it\u2019s played offline locally.\nThose in the know realize that there are better choices for online structure. The most popular right now that fighting game players have been constantly asking for is called \u201crollback\u201d netcode. The Fighting Game Glossary offers an in-depth explanation of how that system works.\n\u201cAn approach to implementing netcode in a fighting game that plays your own inputs immediately, and then rewinds and resimulates (or \u2018rolls back\u2019) the game if network delay causes inconsistencies, \u201cthe site explains. \u201cRollback is the best known netcode solution for fighting games; since all your local inputs come out without delay, the game feels like offline play, and clever design choices can often hide any network trouble as well, leaving you with a close to flawless online experience even across long distances.\u201d\nAn amazing example of this networking in action can be seen in the new Arc System Works fighting game, Guilty Gear Strive. Its usage of rollback netcode allows online matches to be played like never before. The smooth connections between players, even those separated by oceans, allow for serious matches, which makes real tournaments possible from the comfort of one\u2019s home.\nFans of the\u00a0Smash series,\u00a0Ultimate, in particular, have had to watch on as other fighters have implemented this online structure over the years. The list of games includes a fan client, which updates Super Smash Bros. Melee with rollback and true matchmaking, making its scene more lively and accessible than ever.\nWith Nintendo apparently looking into a new multiplayer server system titled, \u201cNPLN\u201d and adding a hardwired Ethernet port to the Switch OLED, we\u2019re all left wondering if there will be some true updates to smooth out its networking coming soon. However, Super Smash Bros. community members are pessimistic that they will see meaningful changes. Smash community leader and commentator Terrence \u201cTKBreezy\u201d Kershaw notes that the community\u2019s pleas have continually gone on deaf ears.\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s too hard to figure out what Nintendo is thinking,\u201d Kershaw tells Digital Trends. \u201cThey\u2019ve been hearing the same complaints for years about internet and stuff and they\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d\nWhile Kershaw plans on picking up a Switch OLED model, he doesn\u2019t believe the new wired port will have a real impact on the issues that have plagued the Smash fanbase for years. \u201cI plan on buying one, but I don\u2019t think this fixes Nintendo netcode issues by any means. That\u2019s a server-side issue they\u2019d have to overhaul in my opinion,\u201d Kershaw says.\nWhile Nintendo seems to be making better networking conditions somewhat more accessible through the new Ethernet port addition, it just feels too little too late for the Nintendo Switch. It wouldn\u2019t truly improve anyone\u2019s online experiences. Nintendo is treating a symptom instead of tackling the root cause.\nAll we can hope is that the company will finally look into true netcode upgrades to make its Switch online subscription\u00a0worthwhile. As for the potential NPLN plan, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if that\u2019s a real solution to its decade-old issue.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.\nCopyright \u00a92021 Designtechnica Corporation.

L\u2019essentiel est dans le nom\u00a0: l\u2019\u00c3\u00a9cran LCD qui n\u2019avait franchement rien d\u2019\u00c3\u00a9poustouflant, est remplac\u00c3\u00a9 par une dalle OLED.

                    "value": "Here's everything we know about Nintendo's upcoming Switch OLED model, including the price, release date, specs, and more.\nIn typical fashion, Nintendo surprised fans by unveiling a revision of the Switch hardware. Known officially as the Nintendo Switch (OLED model), this new version improves upon the design of its predecessor in several ways, including the addition of an OLED screen, enhanced audio, and more. While it's not the long-rumored upgraded Switch Pro model that many fans had hoped for, it still represents the next functional step forward for the hybrid console handheld. Below we detail everything you need to know about the upcoming Switch OLED.\nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\nThe Switch OLED is scheduled to launch on October 8. This date also happens to be the same as the release of Metroid Dread; maybe that's why white is the flagship color for the console.\nSwitch OLED is priced at $349.99--$50 more than the standard Switch model. You're definitely paying for that OLED screen premium, but this price also includes the new, enhanced Switch dock that features an ethernet jack.\nAs its name implies, Nintendo's upcoming console sports an OLED screen, allowing it to display a more vibrant image than the LCD screen found on the original Switch and Switch Lite. The screen itself is larger, measuring in at 7 inches instead of the original's 6.2 inches. As the primary feature of the upcoming revision, it's a particular boon to players who primarily play Switch in handheld mode.\nAside from the screen, the Switch OLED also improves upon its predecessor's audio with enhanced sound. That's according to Nintendo's official announcement, although it didn't offer any specifics as to what kind of changes we can expect. Other major improvements include a wider, adjustable kickstand, an updated dock with a wired LAN port, and 64 GB of internal storage. The new Switch dock can also be purchased by itself.\nDespite these additions, the Switch OLED's internal architecture is virtually identical to the current models in the market, meaning you won't get improved performance or 4K output. The Joy-Cons it uses are also the same as the original model, meaning that the infamous Joy-Con drift may continue to be an issue.\nIf you've been following Nintendo, then chances are you have been aware of the numerous rumors alluding to a new Switch model that beefs up the console's performance and capability. Reports suggested we'd learn about such a revision before E3, but the time came and went without an official announcement. Instead, we got the Switch OLED.\nAt first blush, the release of this revision seems to run against the prevailing demand for a more powerful Switch from diehard fans. But if anything, the release of the OLED model runs consistent with Nintendo's overall strategy. You need only look to Nintendo's DS and 3DS family of handhelds as a prime example of the company's persistence in consistently releasing revisions to stabilize demand throughout a given console generation. That strategy has appeared frequently in Nintendo's console history.\nGameSpot recently spoke to three major games industry analysts to gain insight into why Nintendo has chosen to release the OLED model over an enhanced upgrade. Be sure to check out our feature that answers why Switch OLED is coming for more information on the subject.\nNintendo released a general trailer outlining the new features of the Switch OLED while also offering a glimpse at how it looks compared to its predecessor. You can watch it in the embed above.\nBelow you can find a more detailed look at specs for the Nintendo Switch OLED, including its exact dimensions, weight, video output information, and more. If you want to see how the Switch OLED compares in specs with the other Switch models, be sure to check out our Switch console comparison.\nApproximately 4.5 - 9 hoursThe battery life will depend on the games you play. For instance, the battery will last approximately 5.5 hours for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\nAs of this writing, the Switch OLED model isn't up for preorder at retailers.

                    "value": "A sweet, feature-filled launcher with a beautiful UX.\nNintendo has announced a new version of the Nintendo Switch hybrid console, but it may not be everything you were hoping for. The company calls it the Nintendo Switch OLED model, and if that name isn\u2019t clear enough, this is a version with an OLED screen instead of the LCD panel on the original. It has other improvements, too.\nLet\u2019s get into the changes, then. The Nintendo Switch OLED model features a 7-inch OLED display. By contrast, the current model has a 6.2-inch LCD display, so this is quite the upgrade in terms of contrast, the vividness of the colors, and potentially, brightness. It\u2019s also just bigger, so it\u2019s a bit more immersive. However, there\u2019s no mention of a change in resolution, so you\u2019re still going to be dealing with 720p on the built-in display. That falls in line with what we heard from reports earlier this year, and it\u2019s likely that this is a Samsung OLED panel. The shell of the console is only slightly wider than the base model, so you\u2019re going to get much smaller bezels around the screen.\nWhat doesn\u2019t fall in line with existing rumors is the lack of any mention of upgraded performance. We\u2019ve been hearing for a while about the possibility of DLSS support making it to a Switch revision \u2013 referred to as the Switch Pro \u2013 but nothing like that is mentioned. There\u2019s no 4K support either. Whether that means this is a different model or these performance improvements simply aren\u2019t happening is still a mystery.\nThere are other improvements here, though. Nintendo has thankfully doubled the amount of internal storage to 64GB, which is a very welcome upgrade from the 32GB of the original model. Many games required a microSD card to install on it, so this will help alleviate some of those problems. Nintendo is also touting better sound from the built-in speakers. And if that\u2019s not enough, the kickstand has been redesigned to take up the entire width of the system, and it\u2019s also adjustable now. If you\u2019ve ever used a Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode, you\u2019ll know how flimsy the current kickstand is, so this is a big improvement.\nAside from the Switch system itself, there are also upgrades to the dock. Specifically, it now has a built-in Ethernet (LAN) port, so you can play your games in wired mode for a faster and more reliable connection. Before, you\u2019d need to get a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for the same effect. The dock also appears to have been slightly tweaked in terms of design, featuring more rounded corners at the top.\nAs for the price, you can expect to shell out $349.99 when the Nintendo Switch OLED model releases on October 8. That\u2019s $50 more than the base Switch, which has cost $299.99 since its release on March 3, 2017. Reports initially pegged it for a release as early as September, so this isn\u2019t very far off from that. It will be available in a new model with white Joy-Con and a white dock, or you can get it with a black dock and the Neon Red/Neon Blue Joy-Con, similar to the existing Switch model.\nWriter at XDA Computing.

Learn more.\nBest answer: No. The Nintendo Switch OLED Model is just another revision of the Nintendo Switch, with no boost to performance. Right now, we're not sure the Nintendo Switch Pro actually exists.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED model is not the same thing as the long-rumored Nintendo Switch Pro. There are some similarities, such as the larger screen and (obviously) the OLED display panel. With that in mind, this is still a Nintendo Switch. The processing power, RAM, and other internals have not changed, so all the best Nintendo Switch games like the upcoming sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will run identically across all Nintendo Switch versions, including the OLED Model.\nRumors and reports for the Switch Pro indicated it would feature 4K graphics through NVIDIA DLSS technology, at least when docked, in addition to the aforementioned OLED screen. If this does happen, it'll be a model further out than what Nintendo is sharing right now.\nThe OLED panel being used in this new Switch revision means that games could have improved colors. Outside of the namesake panel, there are a few other differences in the Nintendo Switch OLED Model.\nThe screen is very slightly larger than the one in the regular Switch, at 7 inches vs 6.2 inches. It also features double the storage capacity of the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Lite, with 64 GB of space instead of the normal 32 GB, meaning you can install more games before needing to buy a microSD card. The new dock also includes a LAN port and Nintendo has confirmed that this new dock will be available separately for anyone only interested in that particular upgrade.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED Model is currently scheduled to arrive on October 8, 2021. The console will ship alongside Metroid Dread and comes in two color schemes. One features neon red and blue Joy-Cons like prior Switch models, while the other is white, matching Samus' armor in Metroid Dread.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED Model will cost $350, which is $50 more than the regular Nintendo Switch and $150 more than the Nintendo Switch Lite. Preorders have not yet opened but are expected to begin very soon across various retailers.\nIf you don't want to pay extra for an OLED panel, go ahead and grab a regular Nintendo Switch right now. You'll gain access to a strong library of games and you aren't missing out on additional processing power.\nGrab a Nintendo Switch eShop gift card and you'll be good to go.

A Nintendo representative confirmed with GameSpot that the Joy-Cons will remain the same from the stock Nintendo Switch.\n\"The Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch system (OLED model),\" the Nintendo representative said. \"The configuration and functionality is the same as that of the Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch system.\"\nYou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\nMany Switch owners have complained of Joy-Con drift, a phenomenon where the stick signals input to the console when it's actually in a neutral position. Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the drift back in 2020, and there are several lawsuits pending over the issue in US courts.\nThe Nintendo Switch (OLED model) will cost $50 more than the base Switch and will feature a larger OLED screen. The new model launches October 8. Though it's technically an upgrade over the base model, many in the gaming media expected a \"Switch Pro\" that would boost the console's resolution to 4K.

                    "value": "The new Switch OLED isn't the massive hardware upgrade many hoped, but it seems like a perfect fit for handheld players like me who weren't swayed by the Switch Lite.\nNintendo's announcement of a new Switch OLED model was met with more of a whimper than a bang, judging by the reaction of many on the internet. Perhaps expectations had been bloated by the months of reports and rumors suggesting that this new model would be a significant power upgrade. Maybe after four years with the Nintendo Switch, fans are just itching for a bigger splash. For whatever reason, the modest feature upgrade isn't the game-changer that many Switch users (or prospective owners) hoped for. But as a handheld player who has never felt comfortable committing to the Switch Lite, it looks to be the perfect fit for my use-case.\nThe Switch OLED's upgrades are undoubtedly minimal. The simple fact that Nintendo is naming it after its biggest new feature--the new, slightly larger OLED screen--should show that this is more of a step than a leap. It packs some other improvements, like a better kickstand, more internal storage, and a LAN port built into the dock. None are exactly earth-shattering, especially when compared to expectations that a new Switch would bring performance upgrades including the ability to output to 4K. A real \"Switch Pro\" upgrade with 4K support and a faster processor may still be coming, but this isn't it. And while a technical upgrade would be welcome as some games have shown poorly against the hardware's limitations, the OLED model feels like a welcome upgrade until that theoretical newer model shows up.\nI've always treated the Nintendo Switch as a handheld system. I can probably count the number of times I've docked it on both hands, and it's never stayed docked for long. This habit made the Nintendo Switch Lite a tempting proposition: A smaller form factor and bright colors looked like a fun way to keep playing my Switch library in a method more akin to my long history with Nintendo handhelds.\nAt the same time, I was always held back by a nagging doubt. Would I miss the option to dock the system on the rare occasion that I want to? What if my kids want to play multiplayer games on the big screen with me? Would I be missing out? I never did pick up a Switch Lite because those questions made me perpetually afraid to take the plunge. I didn't want to cut off access to the Switch's namesake feature. I wanted an upgrade that catered to me as a handheld player but didn't lock me into it.\nI will admit to a certain degree of tech lust. I'm the type of person who happily followed Nintendo through various DS and then 3DS upgrades. This probably makes me Nintendo's ideal customer--the 30-something with disposable income, childlike affection for Mario and Pikachu, and a high degree of temptation toward the shiny and new. So part of my lingering desire for a Switch Lite was simply that I wanted the newest thing, but what held me back was that it didn't really suit my needs.\nThe Switch OLED, by comparison, appears to find that balance much more cohesively. It's slightly larger and heavier, but by such a small margin that I doubt I'd ever notice. The screen upgrade will be appreciated, and I love the new white/black color scheme. The built-in LAN port is a nice-to-have for when I want to dock the system, but more importantly, the upgrade doesn't negate my ability to dock the system. I still have the option to switch with my Switch.\nI wanted an upgrade that catered to me as a handheld player but didn't lock me into it.\nThe Switch OLED isn't right for everyone. Obviously, if you treat it as a console first and foremost, the major marquee new feature is essentially meaningless to you. This system is targeted toward handheld players, and more precisely, toward ones like me who still want to dock their systems. Nintendo's account data from 2017 showed that 30% of Switch owners played in handheld mode more than 80% of the time. By comparison, 20% played in dock mode 80+% of the time, so there's a relatively small but still significant difference in system use. And naturally, this is old data, so the breakdown may have changed since then--especially with the flurry of new adopters last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStill, if we assume the numbers are still roughly accurate, it's easy to see why Nintendo is putting out this new model. With more than 80 million Switch systems sold, an upgrade that appeals to roughly 30% amounts to tens of millions of potential customers. In fact, that 2017 data may have influenced Nintendo's decision to release the Switch Lite in 2019. By all accounts, the Switch Lite is doing fine for itself, but Nintendo must see an open market opportunity that it didn't reach with the handheld-only model. The internet's reaction to the Switch OLED may have been muted, but the impact on sales almost definitely will not be--particularly when considering the higher price tag.\nSo, assuming I can find one--an open question if there ever was one, given recent trends in hardware shortages--I'll be satisfied with a modestly upgraded Nintendo Switch. It feels aimed squarely at me, as a handheld player who never felt fully comfortable committing to handheld-only forever and ever.\nSteve Watts has loved video games since that magical day he first saw Super Mario Bros. at his cousin's house.

Rodrigo reiterated performance is not what the OLED system is for and said Switch owners can ultimately \"stick with the current one if you're not digging the screen.\"\nNope. Not what\u2019s for. Stick with the current one if you\u2019re not digging the screen.\nRodrigo's comment makes sense. The Switch OLED model is ostensibly a mid-cycle refresh, not the upgraded version that's been reported and rumored to feature 4K output and better performance. In fact, Nintendo told VGC that the OLED model has \"no major internal changes\" over the current one. When reached for comment, Nintendo told us that the OLED model also uses the same Joy-Cons.\nFurther, it remains unclear if there even is an upgraded Nintendo Switch in the works. The company continues to deny whether a \"Nintendo Switch Pro\" will launch this year. Though president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company is always developing new hardware, it won't comment on the rumors.\nIn short, the Switch OLED model isn't for everyone. In fact, based on Rodrigo's statement, this console refresh might cater to a specific audience: those uninterested in the Nintendo Switch Lite. And multiple analysts say a mid-cycle refresh should be expected from Nintendo at this time.\nContrast Rodrigo's statement with what former Microsoft president Don Mattrick said during E3 in June 2013. In response to the Xbox One's \"always-on\" internet connection requirement, Mattrick told fans in an interview with Geoff Keighley to stick with the Xbox 360 if internet wasn't available.\nThe Xbox One's strict limitations would've bifurcated the audience and meant that those without a stable internet connection had to forgo Xbox One exclusives and entire functions. Nintendo, with the Switch OLED, isn't splitting the install base. Regular Switch owners and those who opt for the OLED version won't get different games--they will just look a little better on the bigger screen.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED model launches on October 8 for $350.\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Nintendo a fait un choix pragmatique.\nHier, Nintendo a annonc\u00e9 sa nouvelle Nintendo Switch OLED. Ce que l\u2019on retiendra de cette annonce est \u00e9videmment le nouvel \u00e9cran OLED de 7 pouces. Nintendo a fait le choix de ne pas changer la puce Nvidia qui l\u2019anime avec la m\u00eame quantit\u00e9 de m\u00e9moire vive. Pourquoi un tel choix\u2009? Il y a plusieurs explications.\nAvec la Switch, la Switch Lite et d\u00e9sormais la Switch OLED, on peut dire que Nintendo a clairement donn\u00e9 ses lettres de noblesse \u00e0 la puce Nvidia Tegra\u00a0X1.\nC\u2019est la m\u00eame puce qui \u00e9quipe trois g\u00e9n\u00e9rations de box Shield TV. Pour rappel, c\u2019est un SoC ARM grav\u00e9 en 20\u00a0nm avec du quad-core ARM Cortex\u00a0A57 en big.LITTLE, coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 un quad-core Cortex\u00a0A53, le tout cadenc\u00e9 \u00e0 2,0\u00a0GHz. Graphiquement, on retrouve une puce graphique Maxwell de 2 SMM, avec une nouvelle technique de traitement, permettant aux 256 c\u0153urs CUDA de traiter les informations en FP16. Notez qu\u2019il y a eu un passage au 16 nm en 2019 qui entra\u00een\u00e9 une baisse notable de la consommation : de 13,3 W \u00e0 7 d\u00e9sormais, soit presque la moiti\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qui explique que l\u2019autonomie a augment\u00e9. Dans tous les cas, techniquement, c\u2019est une ancienne g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de puce, les puces actuelles sont grav\u00e9es en 7 et 5\u00a0nm.\nEn 2015, c\u2019\u00e9tait clairement un SoC avant-gardiste, tel que l\u2019est l\u2019Apple\u00a0M1 qui \u00e9quipe les nouveaux Mac Apple Silicon depuis 2020. Six ans plus tard, ce Tegra\u00a0X1 est encore capable de prouesses, il g\u00e8re le HDR et la d\u00e9finition 4K sur une Shield TV. Mais pour la Switch, c\u2019est toujours du 720p HD en mode portable et du 1080p Full HD en mode TV.\nLa Switch OLED n\u2019int\u00e8gre pas le HDR. Elle ne fait pas non plus de 4K ou de 120 images par seconde. Sur le papier, c\u2019est fou, un smartphone \u00e0 200\u00a0euros propose une meilleure densit\u00e9 de pixels. Nintendo a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas r\u00e9pondre aux attentes des technophiles. Rivaliser avec Sony ou Microsoft n\u2019int\u00e9resse pas le groupe japonais, la Switch se vend tr\u00e8s bien sans avoir \u00e0 se lancer dans cette course \u00e0 la technologie.\nDe plus, Nintendo n\u2019aura pas \u00e0 expliquer les diff\u00e9rences de performances entre ses consoles, comme ils ont d\u00fb le faire par le pass\u00e9 lorsque la DSi ou la New 3DS ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commercialis\u00e9es. C\u2019est un choix pragmatique et raisonnable qui va dans le sens du positionnement historique de la marque japonaise.\nLe monde de l\u2019\u00e9lectronique conna\u00eet depuis le d\u00e9but de la pand\u00e9mie une p\u00e9nurie globale. PS5, Xbox Series X, GeForce RTX, automobile, smartphone Samsung\u2026 il est impossible de cartographier la p\u00e9nurie qui touche actuellement ce secteur. 2021 est la pire ann\u00e9e pour construire ou acheter un nouveau PC. C\u2019est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s difficile de mettre la main sur une PS5 ou une Xbox Series X. Cette p\u00e9nurie touche m\u00eame le secteur du smartphone, ce qui pousse des constructeurs \u00e0 retarder et m\u00eame annuler des lancements de nouveaux produits.\nLa crise du silicium est n\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur de calcul lorsque la pand\u00e9mie du coronavirus a frapp\u00e9 le monde entier en 2020. Quand le Covid-19 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se propager de la Chine au reste du monde, de nombreuses entreprises ont pr\u00e9vu que les gens feraient des \u00e9conomies. Elles ont utilis\u00e9 la crise financi\u00e8re comme mod\u00e8le. N\u00e9anmoins, ce n\u2019est pas ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Les gens ont voulu s\u2019\u00e9quiper en TV, en ordinateurs, en consoles de jeux, en v\u00e9lo \u00e9lectrique\u2026\nM\u00eame si Nvidia a con\u00e7u un nouveau processeur Tegra, certainement mis au point des prototypes de Nintendo Switch Pro, cela ne signifie pas que les fournisseurs de Nintendo pourraient n\u00e9cessairement produire les puces \u2013 en particulier pas dans les quantit\u00e9s dont Nintendo aurait besoin pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande et remplir les \u00e9tag\u00e8res des magasins.\nLe Tegra\u00a0X1 reste une puce grav\u00e9e en 20\u00a0nm, les lignes de production sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande. C\u2019est ce que nous avons pu voir ces derniers mois, les Switch et Switch Lite ont connu tr\u00e8s peu de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019approvisionnement. Clairement, Nintendo a surf\u00e9 sur la vague de la pand\u00e9mie. Comme nous ne savons pas quand sera termin\u00e9e cette crise, pourquoi prendre le risque de ne pas pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande des prochains mois\u2009? Encore une fois, c\u2019est un choix pragmatique.\nLe cloud gaming va conna\u00eetre son heure de gloire \u00e0 partir de 2021. C\u2019est Microsoft qui a d\u00e9sormais le meilleur produit du secteur avec le Game Pass. On peut d\u00e9sormais y jouer depuis Android, iOS, Windows, macOS\u2026 en Full HD jusqu\u2019\u00e0 60 IPS. Th\u00e9oriquement, Microsoft pourra m\u00eame proposer de la d\u00e9finition, 4K car ils installent d\u00e9sormais des Series X personnalis\u00e9es dans leurs centres de donn\u00e9es.\nSachant que la puce Tegra\u00a0X1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue pour le streaming, c\u2019est en tout cas le produit historique pour promouvoir le service GeForce Now de Nvidia, la Switch peut th\u00e9oriquement \u00eatre une plateforme ultime pour un service de cloud gaming. De plus, la nouvelle station d\u2019accueil de la Switch OLED est \u00e9quip\u00e9e d\u2019un port Ethernet. Nintendo pourrait lancer son service de streaming maison dans de bonnes conditions. Techniquement, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eache sur les terminaux des joueurs.\nLes notifications push vous permettent de recevoir toute l'actualit\u00e9 de Frandroid en temps r\u00e9el dans votre navigateur ou sur votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone Android.\nBeaucoup de jeux Nintendo pour lesquels les gens ach\u00e8tent leurs consoles sont des exclusivit\u00e9s pour rappel.\nIl y a un port ethernet sur le nouveau dock..\nJe pense effectivement que Nintendo pr\u00e9pare une nouvelle console Next Gen et donc comme tu dis gardent ces technologies pour plus tard. Maintenant tout le monde c'est gourr\u00e9, m\u00eame les pros qui ont l'\u00e9tiquette Nostradamus. Alors peut-\u00eatre que Nintendo a juste d\u00e9cid\u00e9 au dernier moment de changer d'avis car ils attendent certainement que la crise des mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res soit derri\u00e8re pour pouvoir produire sans contraintes, ou alors attendent que PS5 sorte sa version PRO pour sortir quelque chose de neuf et \u00e9viter de paraitre cheap sur le march\u00e9 des consoles. A rappeler que la Switch est sortie \u00e0 la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode que le PS4 Pro (2016-2017), ils pourraient bien la refaire ce coup-ci.\nMeme Nintendo avait avoue demi mot existant de prototype switch 4K. Je pense garde  sous le coude pour la prochaine gen console.\nfranchement la 4k sur TV \u00e7a n'a pas grand int\u00e9r\u00eat quand on voit les TV 4k ont un bon upscale et depuis son canap\u00e9 pas de diff\u00e9rences. Mais une densit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9cran portable aurait pu \u00eatre cool pour les exp\u00e9riences VR du Nintendo labo. Apr\u00e8s je comprend la volont\u00e9 de ne pas cr\u00e9er de version pro mais un peu de ram en plus ou un processeur un peu overclock\u00e9 pourrait am\u00e9liorer certains jeux en \u00e9vitant les ralentissements sans forcement appeler \u00e7a pro\nIl n'y a pas non plus de jeux compatibles 4K chez Nintendo.\nOn arrive sur les 5 ans de la PS4 Pro, premi\u00e8re console \"compatible\" 4K. Je pense pas que sortir une Switch qui aurait une sortie 4K irait \u00e0 l'encontre des pr\u00e9ceptes de Gunpei Yokoi, m\u00eame si ca reste \u00e9videmment tr\u00e8s important dans l'ADN de Nintendo.\nNOUVELLE NINTENDO SWITCH OLED : Infos et R\u00e9action !

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.\nIn brief, Omdia doesn\u2019t expect the Nintendo Switch OLED Model to have a significant impact on the market, nor Nintendo\u2019s overall trajectory. The new SKU\u2019s feature enhancements over original Switch hardware are minimal and do not provide a compelling reason for existing users to upgrade. However, its relative affordability in relation to existing Switch hardware \u2013 and the prospect of a more premium Nintendo experience \u2013 may be enough to attract prospective new Switch owners and dedicated Nintendo fans.\nWhile some industry watchers were expecting the announcement of a more powerful, \u201cpro\u201d version of the Switch, there never was a compelling business case for Nintendo to launch such a device. Indeed, the Switch is already enjoying strong momentum and releasing a more powerful version of the Switch would risk splitting the user base and complicating the development process. It therefore makes sense for Nintendo to release a minor, fully backwards compatible upgrade to the existing Switch hardware. The new OLED model fulfills this brief and is line with what Omdia was expecting and, as such, we do not anticipate its release to impact our existing Switch hardware sales forecast.\nAs we have previously stated, Nintendo Switch has hit its peak higher and later than is typical of Nintendo\u2019s consoles. And, as shown in the below figure, we also expect Switch\u2019s decline from its peak to be much less severe than that of the Wii. Together, these trends signify that a full hardware refresh is not necessary at this stage in the Switch\u2019s lifecycle.\nTo be clear, the new OLED Switch does little to differentiate itself from the standard model. While the new, larger OLED screen will offer gamers a more vibrant and colorful handheld visual experience, it still has the same native resolution of 720p. This is necessary given the lack of any processor upgrades, but it also means that the new SKU\u2019s titular feature actually has a lower pixel density than even the original Switch model that launched back in 2017.\nOther new features are not exactly ground-breaking either, and most of them can be \u2013 relatively cheaply \u2013 retrofitted to the original hardware. For instance, although the new model comes with double the internal storage as the original Switch and Switch Lite, this can easily be upgraded on any model with the purchase of a microSD card. Meanwhile, the new LAN port on the upgraded dock is also a feature that can be added to the original hardware by way of a cheap USB adapter. The battery is also identical to that found in the most recent standard Switch SKU, and is expected to last the same amount of time at between 4.5 and 9 hours. Plus the OLED model still seems to lack some features \u2013 such as support for Bluetooth headphones \u2013 which made the Switch seem outdated in 2017, let alone in 2021 when most flagship smartphones don\u2019t even come with a headphone jack.\nEven so, upgrades over the original Switch do exist \u2013 along with the new screen, the new kickstand and improved audio will no doubt be well received \u2013 but, on the face of it, there isn\u2019t a huge case for existing users to pay $350 to swap their original hardware for the OLED model. Existing users that mostly play their Switch in handheld mode may be an easier sell for Nintendo, given that the improvements the OLED model brings almost exclusively benefit that mode of playing, but the fact that docked output is still capped at 1080p at 60 frames per second means that owning the new model will in no way improve the experience of using the Switch as a home console.\nHowever, those in the market for a new Switch are likely to find it a more attractive proposition \u2013 it will retail for just $50 more than the original Switch \u2013 which is justifiable, given the superior screen technology and quality of life upgrades that it brings to the table.\nFinally, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model should not be seen as Nintendo\u2019s response to launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Nintendo occupies a completely different space in the market to Sony and Microsoft and, as such, has no need \u2013 or intention \u2013 to compete on a head-to-head basis with either company. Instead, the main point of the OLED Switch is to give Nintendo customers more choice when it comes to its hardware, representing the most premium way to play Nintendo\u2019s acclaimed first-party titles. And, despite the lack of meaningful upgrades, this could well be a compelling enough reason for many Nintendo fans to pick one up when it launches later this year."

                    "value": "Nintendo unveiled the new Switch OLED model just as rumors said it would. The company announced the new console on its own terms, several months ahead of the expected fall launch. The initial estimates said the device would arrive before E3 in June, but that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, Nintendo launched the device quietly on Tuesday, knowing it would make waves. The new Switch did not receive the expected \u201cPro\u201d moniker, with Nintendo focusing on a specific upgrade. The larger OLED screen is the kind of upgrade gamers will appreciate, and it\u2019s in line with recent rumors. But it turns out that all of those reports were way off about the other expected upgrades. Nintendo has just confirmed the disappointing Switch OLED specs, fully knowing that it will probably not impact sales.\nNintendo\u2019s Switch OLED announcement the other day only delivered a few key hardware details for the new console. The device features a 7-inch 720P OLED display, which is slightly larger than the current 6.3-inch LCD screen. The console gets 64GB of storage, a new stand for tabletop mode, and the new dock gets an Ethernet port. Recent reports offered the same specs details for the screen and the dock.\nAll of that will cost $350 when the Switch OLED launches in October. The new console will join the existing Switch and Switch Lite.\nNintendo\u2019s surprise announcement might have confirmed some recent reports, but many of the recent Switch OLED specs rumors have not panned out. The company confirmed to The Verge that the new Switch would not get the new processor or RAM upgrade we expected.\n\u201cNintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models,\u201d the company said.\nThe OLED model will not even get Bluetooth headphone support. \u201cWe have nothing to announce on this topic, but like the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite consoles, Nintendo Switch (OLED model) supports Bluetooth tech for the Joy-Con controllers,\u201d the company said.\nNintendo also confirmed that the old and new Switch docks are interchangeable. You can use the OLED model with the original Switch dock or the other way around.\nAll those Switch \u201cPro\u201d repots said that Nintendo\u2019s new console would deliver significantly improved specs. The purported CPU upgrade leaked recently, and the new dock was supposed to support 4K gaming.\nNintendo is in such a unique position with the Switch that it can do what it wants in terms of specs and not care about sales. The Switch is in a place where it both competes against major rivals but also has no real contender.\nThe Switch battles the PS5 and Xbox Series X, which offer significantly improved hardware for just $150 more than the Switch OLED. But the Switch plays games in handheld mode, which is not something the PlayStation or Xbox can do.\nMore importantly, Nintendo sits on a massive empire of original games that players crave. As long as they can run on the original Switch\u2019s hardware, that\u2019s good enough for everyone involved.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the chip shortage had any impact on the Switch OLED specs decision. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. Nintendo going forward with a device that offers a screen upgrade for $50 makes sense for a company that can\u2019t meet Switch demand. And maybe a Switch Pro upgrade might still land at some point in the future.\nChris Smith started writing about gadgets as a hobby, and before he knew it he was sharing his views on tech stuff with readers around the world. Whenever he's not writing about gadgets he miserably fails to stay away from them, although he desperately tries. But that's not necessarily a bad thing."

It\u2019s possible that the new OLED model dock may have some cooling, but there\u2019s been no confirmation of this.\nAs we alluded to in the reveal article for the Nintendo Switch OLED model, this wasn\u2019t exactly the next generation of Switch hardware we were expecting.

Mais qu'en est-il des autres revendeurs et comment ce prix se d\u00e9cide-t-il ?\nCelle qui \u00e9tait attendue depuis longtemps sous le nom de Nintendo Switch Pro a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 officialis\u00e9e mardi\u00a06\u00a0juillet 2021 sous le nom de Nintendo Switch OLED. Lors de l\u2019annonce, Big N a donn\u00e9 un prix pour sa nouvelle console\u00a0: 350\u00a0dollars. Et en euros\u2009? Impossible \u00e0 savoir sur le coup, et pour cause\u00a0: Nintendo ne communique pas officiellement ses prix en Europe, ce qui m\u00e8ne parfois \u00e0 des situations \u00e9tranges lors de certains lancements o\u00f9 les revendeurs dictent leurs prix.\nLors du lancement de la console en 2017 par exemple, le prix de la Nintendo Switch a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 299\u00a0dollars aux \u00c9tats-Unis et affich\u00e9 \u00e0 349\u00a0euros sur Amazon. Parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 cela, Micromania a d\u2019abord affich\u00e9 \u00e0 la console \u00e0 299\u00a0euros, avant de finalement publier un erratum indiquant qu\u2019elle serait commercialis\u00e9e \u00e0 329,99\u00a0euros.\nFinalement, si vous avez suivi un peu le prix de la console hybride de Nintendo, vous savez peut-\u00eatre que son prix s\u2019est stabilis\u00e9 autour de 300\u00a0euros apr\u00e8s quelques mois seulement et reste le m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle, avec des variations de quelques dizaines d\u2019euros maximum.\nPour la Switch OLED, il semble que l\u2019histoire se r\u00e9p\u00e8te. Annonc\u00e9e \u00e0 349,99\u00a0dollars outre-Atlantique, la console a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9e chez Micromania \u00e0 369\u00a0euros pendant quelques minutes avant que la cha\u00eene ne communique officiellement sur Twitter pour annoncer un prix de 349,99\u00a0euros. Une conversion euros/dollars plus habituelle dans le milieu du jeu vid\u00e9o et de la Tech en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Mais qui r\u00e8gle vraiment ces prix\u2009?\nTous ces cafouillages sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes lois qui emp\u00eachent les marques et les revendeurs de faire exactement ce qu\u2019ils souhaitent. Il est par exemple impossible pour une marque d\u2019imposer un prix \u00e0 des revendeurs pour son produit. Pour que cela soit constat\u00e9, il doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 que la marque \u00e9voque son prix publiquement ou directement au revendeur, et qu\u2019un relev\u00e9 des prix r\u00e9gulier soit mis en place afin de faire de pression.\nC\u2019est pourquoi les marques parlent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de \u00ab\u2009prix conseill\u00e9\u2009\u00bb ou MSRP pour Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price. Libre ensuite aux revendeurs d\u2019appliquer leurs propres tarifs sur cette base tout en cherchant \u00e0 faire de la marge, \u00e0 rester concurrentiel par rapport aux autres enseignes et surtout sans revendre \u00e0 perte.\nCar oui, la revente \u00e0 perte est interdite en France. Autant un constructeur peut vendre un produit manufactur\u00e9 moins cher que l\u2019ensemble de son co\u00fbt de fabrication (dans une certaine mesure), c\u2019est pourquoi on parle souvent de \u00ab\u00a0vente \u00e0 perte\u00a0\u00bb pour les consoles qui mettent parfois plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant d\u2019\u00eatre amorties, autant les revendeurs ne peuvent pas vendre un produit moins cher qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont achet\u00e9. Une enseigne ayant achet\u00e9 une Switch \u00e0 Nintendo \u00e0 310\u00a0euros par exemple ne pourra pas la proposer \u00e0 300.\nDans le cas de la Wii, cela avait d\u2019ailleurs pos\u00e9 probl\u00e8me puisque Nintendo avait publiquement communiqu\u00e9 sur un prix de vente conseill\u00e9 de 249 euros. Prix tr\u00e8s proche de son co\u00fbt pour les revendeurs. Un g\u00e9rant du magasin Leclerc expliquait donc en 2007 que \u00ab\u2009il est impossible de pratiquer un prix inf\u00e9rieur [\u00e0 249 euros] dans la mesure o\u00f9 le prix de 249\u00a0euros correspond \u00e0 quelques centimes pr\u00e8s au seuil de revente \u00e0 perte. Il est impossible de revendre \u00e0 un prix sup\u00e9rieur compte tenu de la publicit\u00e9 faite notamment sur le prix de la console Wii\u2009\u00bb.\nDepuis cette affaire, Nintendo Europe a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus communiquer ses prix conseill\u00e9s, bien que gain de cause lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. C\u2019est donc aux revendeurs d\u2019\u00e9tablir le prix du march\u00e9 en jonglant avec les diff\u00e9rentes l\u00e9gislations, leurs marges et bien \u00e9videmment la concurrence. De leur c\u00f4t\u00e9, Sony et Microsoft continuent toujours \u00e0 communiquer sur un prix de vente conseill\u00e9, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u00e8s l\u2019annonce de leurs consoles.\nEt sur le jeu vid\u00e9o, la concurrence est rude. Pour certains revendeurs, notamment les grandes surfaces, le jeu vid\u00e9o est juste un produit d\u2019appel. Vous venez achetez une console pas ch\u00e8re chez eux, vous repartez avec un caddie plein \u00e0 ras bord de produits \u00e0 la marge bien plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Eux sont gagnants, vous pensez l\u2019\u00eatre, et les boutiques sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es se retrouvent contraintes \u00e0 s\u2019aligner pour garder leur client\u00e8le.\nAujourd\u2019hui, pour la Switch OLED, c\u2019est donc Micromania qui m\u00e8ne la danse en ayant communiqu\u00e9 en premier sur le prix de la console, mais est-ce le prix ferme et d\u00e9finitif\u2009? Difficile \u00e0 dire sans conna\u00eetre le prix d\u2019achat de la console pour les revendeurs (qui peut \u00eatre n\u00e9goci\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment pour chaque enseigne en fonction des quantit\u00e9s), mais certaines boutiques peuvent peut-\u00eatre encore rogner sur leurs marges pour tirer les prix vers le bas.\nOn peut par ailleurs esp\u00e9rer, sans garantie, un prix att\u00e9nu\u00e9 dans les prochains mois ou les prochaines ann\u00e9es. Il parait bizarre de conserver au catalogue une Switch\u00a02019 \u00e0 300\u00a0euros et une Switch OLED \u00e0 350\u00a0euros. Chez Frandroid, on pense que Nintendo va tr\u00e8s certainement \u00e9couler ses derniers stocks de Switch\u00a02019, puis la supprimer de son catalogue, ce qui laissera un cr\u00e9neau \u00e0 300\u00a0euros pour la Switch OLED qui pourra alors prendre sa place. Mais ce n\u2019est l\u00e0 qu\u2019une supposition\u2026\nApr\u00e8s des mois de rumeurs et d\u2019attente pour les fans, Nintendo a enfin d\u00e9voil\u00e9 sa nouvelle Switch OLED dot\u00e9 d\u2019un meilleur \u00e9cran qui arrivera le 8 octobre prochain en magasin.

                    "value": "Smart Home, Software, Hardware, Mobile Computing & Co.\nNintendo hat es wahr gemacht: V\u00f6llig ohne Vorank\u00fcndigungen hat man heute ein neues Modell der Nintendo Switch vorgestellt. Ohne vorherige Pressemitteilungen oder dergleichen wurde die neue Variante der Konsole auf der Website gelistet. Sie erscheint am 8. Oktober 2021. F\u00fcr Deutschland wird noch kein Preis genannt, in den USA soll die Konsole 349,99 US-Dollar kosten.\nNat\u00fcrlich werden alle Spiele und auch das gesamte bereits verf\u00fcgbare Zubeh\u00f6r kompatibel sein. Die neue Version der Konsole nutzt einen OLED-Bildschirm mit 7 Zoll Diagonale. Der Rahmen rund um das Display sei laut Nintendo ebenfalls geschrumpft. Au\u00dferdem wird es noch eine neue Docking-Station geben, die ihr zur Verbindung mit dem TV nutzen k\u00f6nnt. Neu ist im direkten Vergleich mit dem vorherigen Modell ein LAN-Anschluss. Ansonsten ist zu erw\u00e4hnen, dass die Nintendo Switch (OLED-Modell) \u00fcber 64 GByte internen Speicherplatz verf\u00fcgt. Der ist weiterhin auch via microSD erweiterbar.\nAnsonsten gibt Nintendo keine weiteren Ver\u00e4nderungen an. Die Aufl\u00f6sung des Bildschirms liegt also weiterhin bei 720p und auch eine 4K-Ausgabe, die ja zuvor in der Ger\u00fcchtek\u00fcche debattiert wurde, gibt es laut Datenblatt nicht. Ein neuer Tegra-SoC von Nvidia? Auch davon ist nicht die Rede. Die Nintendo Switch Pro, die sich also vielleicht mancher erhofft hatte, ist dieser Ableger offenbar nicht. Wie ihr auf den Artikelbildern seht, hat man dabei auch die Farben angepasst und setzt f\u00fcr die Nintendo Switch mit OLED-Display auf einen wei\u00dfen Look.\nSolltet ihr an der Nintendo Switch (OLED-Modell) Interesse haben, dann k\u00f6nnt ihr euch auf der deutschen Website von Nintendo bereits f\u00fcr weitere Neuigkeiten vorregistrieren. Dabei ist noch unklar, ob das neue Modell nun die bisherige Version komplett ersetzen oder vielmehr erg\u00e4nzen soll. Da der Preis offenbar recht nahe beieinander liegt, k\u00f6nnte durchaus auch ersteres der Fall sein. Warten wir mal auf weitere Einzelheiten.\nIn diesem Artikel sind Amazon-Links enthalten. Durch einen Klick darauf ge\u00adlan\u00adgt ihr direkt zum Anbieter. Solltet ihr euch dort f\u00fcr einen Kauf entscheiden, erhalten wir ei\u00adne kleine Provision. F\u00fcr euch \u00e4ndert sich am Preis nichts.\nMager. Erkl\u00e4rt auch, warum nicht wirklich was angek\u00fcndigt wurde.\nDie Performanceprobleme vieler Spiele liegen allerdings weniger an der Hardware, sondern eher an fehlenden Optimierungen.\nSchade, dass immer wieder Zelda als Problemtitel genannt wird. Das Spiel ist ein Launchtitel, der von der Wii U mit komplett anderer Architektur (IBM CPU + AMD Grafik) portiert wurde. Bis auf die Szene vor dem Dekubaum (wo ohnehin keine Action stattfindet) l\u00e4uft das Spiel doch auch ohne gro\u00dfe Probleme. Trotzdem wird immer wieder diese eine Szene genannt.\nKlar gibt es wirklich ein paar Spiele, die alles aus der Switch herausholen und dennoch nicht ganz einwandfrei laufen oder mit gr\u00f6\u00dferen Kompromissen laufen, wie z. B. Doom. Aber wenn ich mir so die meisten Problemtitel ansehe, liegt es einfach an schlampiger Optimierung. Ganz aktuelles Beispiel ist Ys 9, dass wie ein schlechtes PS3-Spiel aussieht (auch auf PS4/PS5 und PC), aber dennoch mies l\u00e4uft. Da braucht es keine st\u00e4rkere Hardware damit es besser laufen w\u00fcrde.\nEs kann an der schwachen Hardware liegen die ja nicht mal an eine Xbox One heran kommt, es kann aber auch an der Unf\u00e4higkeit mancher Entwickler liegen.\nIch denke es liegt eher an der schwachen Hardware. 4K sollte auch gar nie Nintendos Ziel werden, sondern eher deutlich h\u00f6here grafische Details.\nWenn ich die Wahl h\u00e4tte w\u00fcrde ich FHD + 60 FPS + Ultra Details immer 4K + 30 FPS + Hohe Details  vorziehen.\nIch w\u00fcrde ein ~10 Watt Handheld niemals mit einer Xbox One mit 120 Watt Stromverbrauch vergleichen. Es liegen zudem nur 3 1/2 Jahre zwischen diesen Systemen.\nIch bin immer wieder erstaunt welche Anspr\u00fcche die Leute an eine portable Spielkonsole stellen. Das ist oft komplettes Wunschdenken.\nZu den Spielen: SambZockt auf YouTube hat mal seine Vermutung dazu ge\u00e4u\u00dfert weshalb z. B. das neue Hyrule Warriors so schlecht l\u00e4uft. Bei diesem Spiel liegt es vermutlich an der schlechten Verwendung von transparenten Texturen. Und so gibt es viele Beispiele f\u00fcr verschwendete Performance.\nDie Unreal Engine 4 l\u00e4uft z. B. meist auch eher schlecht auf der Switch, aber mit Dragon Quest 11 haben sich die Entwickler mal auch mit dieser Engine richtig um die Performance gek\u00fcmmert. Dies mit dem Ergebnis, dass DQ11 sehr gut aussieht mit einer gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils tollen Performance und sehr kurzen Ladezeiten.\nSchau dir z. B. an, was Ubisoft mit ihrer Snowdrop Engine in Mario + Rabbids aus der Switch bereits 2017 herausgeholt hat oder Next Level Games mit Luigis Mansion. Es gibt keine Entschuldigung daf\u00fcr weshalb einige andere Spiele (z. B. Ys 9) so viel schlechter aussehen und gleichzeitig auch deutlich schlechter laufen.\nnaja, f\u00fcr neueinsteiger sicherlich sehr interessant.\nF\u00fcr mich als Besitzer der alten Switch ist es dennoch interessant, ich hab es gehasst das ich f\u00fcr die Switch immer extra einen WLAN Adapter laufen lassen musste da die WLAN Antenne in der Switch absolut bescheiden ist. Das kann ich mir nun dank LAN Anschluss sparen. WLAN Adapter und alte Switch werden jetzt direkt verkauft. Spiele eh schon seit Monaten nichts mehr da nichts kommt\u2026dann hol ich mir die neue im Zelda 2 Bundle \ud83d\ude42\nDas geht auch mit der alten Hardware + USB-LAN Adapter. Ist nett, dass das im neuen Dock direkt verbaut ist, aber mehr auch nicht. Ist ja seit Release so m\u00f6glich.\nImmerhin ein paar kleine Verbesserungen, werde ich mir zu Release holen. Die Pro kommt dann sicher in 2-3 Jahren mit 4K und DLSS. Passt schon.\nDeine E-Mail-Adresse wird nicht ver\u00f6ffentlicht.

Several publications, including Bloomberg, suggested that the new model will feature various upgrades, like an OLED display and 4K resolution. It's also reportedly supposed to launch this year, though Nintendo continues to deny that claim.\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com"

Nintendo bietet da eine maximale Aufl\u00f6sung von 1920 x 1080 Pixeln und 60 fps, sofern der Output via HDMI-Kabel im TV-Modus erfolgt. Im Tisch-Modus und Handheld-Modus ist die maximale Aufl\u00f6sung 1280 x 720, was der Bildschirmaufl\u00f6sung entspricht. Das kann ein paar kleine Unterschiede machen.\nNintendo sagt, dass Unterschiede im Spielerlebnis mit einigen Toy-Con-Modellen der Nintendo Labo-Serie aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Konsolen- und Bildschirmgr\u00f6\u00dfen von Nintendo Switch (OLED-Modell) und Nintendo Switch auftreten k\u00f6nnen.\nDar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es m\u00f6glicherweise auch Spiele, bei denen sich das Spielerlebnis aufgrund der neuen Eigenschaften, wie z. B. dem gr\u00f6\u00dferen Bildschirm, etwas unterscheiden k\u00f6nnte.\nEine weitere Information ist, dass die neue Switch-Station einen LAN-Anschluss hat. Auf dieser neuen Station l\u00e4sst sich auch die alte Switch betreiben \u2013 die neue Switch mit OLED wiederum funktioniert auch auf einer alten Station ohne LAN-Anschluss. Neue Controller muss man sich ebenfalls nicht kaufen. Die Joy-Con-Controller, die sich im Lieferumfang der Nintendo Switch (OLED-Modell) befinden, entsprechen denen, die derzeit verf\u00fcgbar sind. Bestehendes Zubeh\u00f6r kann ebenfalls verwendet werden.\nDu kannst den Speicherplatz deiner Konsole mit kompatiblen microSD Cards (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) erweitern.\nDie Akkulaufzeit h\u00e4ngt von der gespielten Software ab. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild kann beispielsweise mit einer Akkuladung etwa 5,5 Stunden lang gespielt werden.\nSpannend \u2013 oder vermutlich eher entt\u00e4uschend ist die Tatsache, dass man seitens Nintendo derzeit noch nichts zum SoC verraten hat. Hier hatten viele leistungsst\u00e4rkere Hardware vermutet, die das Unternehmen auch nennt. Sicherlich wird das eine oder andere neue Detail unter der Haube zu finden sein \u2013 nicht aber die bislang vermuteten Hardware-Details aus der Ger\u00fcchtek\u00fcche, die einen neuen Tegra von Nvidia sahen, der 4K-Aufl\u00f6sung m\u00f6glich macht. Erwartung vieler Spieler: Nintendo Switch Pro mit 4K, DLSS, 120fps und Co. \u2013 Realit\u00e4t: OLED + LAN-Port\u2026 Mal schauen, wer da am 8. Oktober zuschlagen wird, da wird\u2019s die neue Nintendo Switch mit OLED geben \u2013 f\u00fcr 350 Dollar.\nBin schon ein wenig ern\u00fcchtert. Gerade DLSS h\u00e4tte der Konsole sehr gut getan. Der OLED Bildschirm klingt erstmal gut, aber da die Nintendo Switch kein HDR unterst\u00fctzt, stellt sich mir die Frage, inwiefern man dann vom Bildschirm profitiert. Klar, ein paar Unterschiede wird\u2019s schon geben, aber so einen richtig gro\u00dfer Schritt wird das nichts.\nNaja, der Schritt vom bisherigen IPS-Panel mit magerem ~1000:1 Kontrast wird es durchaus ein deutlicher Sprung sein.\nIch bin mittlerweile ein richtiger Fan von OLED-Displays und werde mir die Switch wohl alleine deshalb holen. Nat\u00fcrlich h\u00e4tte ich mir aber auch die Unterst\u00fctzung von HDR gew\u00fcnscht.\nAls Besitzer einer Switch seit kurz nach dem Launch profitiere ich nat\u00fcrlich auch von der deutlich l\u00e4ngeren Akkulaufzeit. Die Konsolen aus dieser Zeit d\u00fcrften ohnehin so langsam merklich an Akkukapazit\u00e4t verlieren.\nSo einfach ist es aber auch nicht. Es gibt in den USA durchaus mehrere Staaten, die null Prozent VAT haben und die h\u00f6chste Rate liegt bei 13,5 Prozent.\nWie der Wechselkurs f\u00fcr Nintendo aussieht steht nat\u00fcrlich auf einem anderen Blatt. \ud83d\ude09\nDie hier verbreitete Annahme, der angegebene Preis ist auch das was der Kunde letztendlich bezahlt ist und war schon immer falsch.\nNe, ist nicht falsch. Bei Staaten ohne VAT zahnst du eben genau das was auf den Zetteln steht.\nJa klar, zahlen sie in den USA weniger f\u00fcr Hardware, denn die VAT ist in den USA durchschnittlich so um 10%, in Europa ist die MwSt fast doppelt so hoch.\nW\u00fcrde mich nicht wundern, bei uns kommt ja noch die Mehrwertsteuer, Zoll, import und nat\u00fcrlich die pauschalen Urheberrechtsabgaben von den modernen Wegelagerer dazu welche die Preise in die H\u00f6he treibt.\nwenn man sie am TV betreibt also keine Besserung.\nDeine E-Mail-Adresse wird nicht ver\u00f6ffentlicht.

Cette nouvelle d\u00e9clinaison de la console hybride n'apporte finalement pas la d\u00e9finition 4K en mode dock, mais promet tout de m\u00eame un meilleur affichage, un port Ethernet sur la station d'accueil et plus de stockage.\nPour une surprise, c\u2019est une surprise, et de taille\u2009! Voici la Nintendo Switch OLED. Alors qu\u2019on attendait une annonce \u00e0 l\u2019E3 2021, c\u2019est de mani\u00e8re bien plus discr\u00e8te que la nouvelle console hybride a \u00e9t\u00e9 officialis\u00e9e. Au programme, un petit lot de changements visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l\u2019exp\u00e9rience utilisateur globale. Cependant, ce n\u2019est pas une Switch Pro.\nTout d\u2019abord, et c\u2019est dans le nom, la grosse diff\u00e9rence de la Nintendo Switch OLED par rapport au mod\u00e8le classique, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9cran OLED, \u00e9videmment.\nAutre diff\u00e9rence concernant ce point\u00a0: vous profiterez ici d\u2019une diagonale plus grande avec une dalle de 7\u00a0pouces.\nNotez d\u2019ailleurs que les bordures noires autour de l\u2019\u00e9cran sont visiblement plus fines, ce qui permet \u00e0 la Switch OLED d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e0 peine plus longue que la version originale : environ 24,13 cm contre 23,87 cm selon la filiale am\u00e9ricaine de la marque. Dans les faits, les dimensions sont quasi identiques malgr\u00e9 un affichage diff\u00e9rent. Le communiqu\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais annonce d\u2019ailleurs strictement les m\u00eames mensurations.\nAttention par contre\u00a0: la 4K n\u2019est pas au rendez-vous. Pourtant, les derni\u00e8res rumeurs \u00e9voquaient que le mode dock d\u00e9bloquerait cette d\u00e9finition pour jouer sur t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur, mais on reste finalement sur du\u20091080p ; et sur du 720p sur la console en elle-m\u00eame.\nEn revanche, le dock accueille une autre nouveaut\u00e9 de taille\u00a0: un port Ethernet. En ins\u00e9rant la Nintendo Switch OLED dans sa station d\u2019accueil, vous pourrez donc profiter d\u2019une meilleure connexion pour vos parties en ligne. H\u00e9las, nous n\u2019avons pas encore de sp\u00e9cifications techniques pr\u00e9cises sur cette int\u00e9gration.\nRecentrons-nous sur la console de jeux en elle-m\u00eame. Au dos de l\u2019appareil, on trouve un support plus large et ajustable qui devrait apporter bien plus de s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de solidit\u00e9 et de stabilit\u00e9 pour les joueurs et joueuses qui souhaitent profiter de la Nintendo Switch OLED en mode stand \u2014 \u00e9cran pos\u00e9 sur une table et les Joy-Con d\u00e9tach\u00e9s dans les mains.\nEnfin, il faut aussi noter que le stockage interne est multipli\u00e9 par deux pour atteindre 64 Go.

Pour le moment, on ne conna\u00eet que son prix aux \u00c9tats-Unis\u00a0: 349,99\u00a0dollars, soit un peu plus de 295\u00a0euros HT. Le prix conseill\u00e9 en France sera toutefois tr\u00e8s certainement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\nD\u2019autant plus que le prix am\u00e9ricain est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019environ 50\u00a0dollars par rapport \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9clinaison. Pour rappel, la Nintendo Switch premi\u00e8re du nom co\u00fbtait 329\u00a0euros en France. On peut donc pr\u00e9dire un tarif aux alentours de 379 ou 399\u00a0euros.\nNotez que le coloris blanc est beaucoup mis en avant \u2014 Joy-Con et station d\u2019accueil \u2013, mais une version avec les traditionnelles manettes rouge et bleu existe \u00e9galement.\nLa Nintendo Switch OLED promet une meilleure qualit\u00e9 d\u2019affichage et vous trouverez ici toutes les qualit\u00e9s que la console pourra mettre en avant.

Seules les dimensions d\u2019occupation de l\u2019\u00e9cran varient.\nSi vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez un mod\u00e8le plus petit, la Nintendo Switch Lite est de fait plus compacte (91,1\u00a0mm x 208\u00a0mm x 13,9\u00a0mm).\nLes deux Switch hybrides disposent d\u2019une station d\u2019accueil pour se recharger et \u00eatre raccord\u00e9es \u00e0 un \u00e9cran externe. \u00c0 noter que la premi\u00e8re Switch disposait d\u2019un tout petit pied pour tenir debout loin du dock. Sur le mod\u00e8le OLED, le pied a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largi \u00e0 toute la largeur de la console pour \u00eatre plus stable. Il est m\u00eame possible d\u2019incliner bien plus qu\u2019avant la console pour le confort de jeu.\nDu c\u00f4t\u00e9 des haut-parleurs, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repositionn\u00e9s un peu plus bas sous l\u2019\u00e9cran sur le mod\u00e8le OLED et paraissent plus larges que sur la version classique. Nintendo annonce d\u2019ailleurs \u00ab\u2009un son am\u00e9lior\u00e9\u2009\u00bb. La Switch Lite propose \u00e9galement deux haut-parleurs st\u00e9r\u00e9o positionn\u00e9s en dessous de l\u2019\u00e9cran en fa\u00e7ade. La prise jack 3,5\u00a0mm est toujours pr\u00e9sente sur chacun des mod\u00e8les.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 la principale diff\u00e9rence entre les trois mod\u00e8les. La Switch et la Switch Lite dispose d\u2019une dalle tactile capacitive LCD. Elle propose une diagonale de 6,2\u00a0pouces sur la Switch et de 5,5\u00a0pouces sur la Switch Lite.\nLa nouvelle Nintendo Switch embarque un \u00e9cran tactile capacitif d\u00e9sormais OLED qui passe \u00e0 7\u00a0pouces. Avec ce changement, c\u2019est la promesse d\u2019un \u00e9cran plus lumineux, avec des couleurs plus \u00e9clatantes et un meilleur contraste qui se dessinent. Nintendo a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 garder le m\u00eame gabarit pour sa console et ce sont les bordures qui sont repouss\u00e9es, et donc amincies par rapport au mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nMais la d\u00e9finition maximale propos\u00e9e est la m\u00eame sur l\u2019\u00e9cran des deux Switch hybrides (1280\u00d7720 \u2014 le 1080p/60\u00a0fps est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au mode TV). Cependant, il faut noter que la r\u00e9solution sera de fait moins bonne sur la Switch OLED puisque son \u00e9cran est plus grand. Mais cela n\u2019augure nullement d\u2019une qualit\u00e9 moins bonne, loin de l\u00e0.\nLes deux Nintendo Switch et Switch OLED utiliseront les m\u00eames Joy-Con, avec les vibrations HD, la cam\u00e9ra infrarouge \u00e0 d\u00e9tecteur de mouvements. Une paire est fournie avec la console (grise sur le mod\u00e8le OLED, bleu et rouge sur la classique) et l\u2019ensemble des manettes sera compatible sur l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre console hybride.\nSi vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez opter pour la Switch Lite, les commandes sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9es \u00e0 la version uniquement portable et les manettes ne sont \u00e9videmment pas d\u00e9tachables. En revanche, mais vous pouvez connecter des Joy-Con pour les jeux utilisant les vibrations ou la cam\u00e9ra infrarouge.\nLa Switch classique et la Switch OLED peuvent \u00eatre raccord\u00e9es \u00e0 un t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur ou un moniteur disposant de prise HDMI. Si vous d\u00e9tachez les manettes Joy-Con, il est \u00e9galement possible de les utiliser en mode sur table en faisant reposer l\u2019\u00e9cran sur le pied. Dans les deux cas, vous pouvez compter de 1 \u00e0 8\u00a0joueurs sur une console. Les deux mod\u00e8les sont \u00e9galement utilisables en mode portable n\u2019importe o\u00f9.\nLa Nintendo Switch Lite ne peut, elle, \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e qu\u2019en mode portable et en solo. Mais vous pouvez cependant tenter le multijoueur sur le petit \u00e9cran de la console en connectant un Joy-Con ou une manette compatible.\nSi vous aviez la toute premi\u00e8re Nintendo Switch, vous allez sentir une diff\u00e9rence. En revanche, si vous avez achet\u00e9 plus tardivement la console japonaise, vous avez sans doute h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la version am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, notamment au niveau de l\u2019autonomie qui s\u2019\u00e9tend d\u00e9sormais de 4,5 \u00e0 9\u00a0heures selon le jeu (la palme de la gourmandise revenant initialement \u00e0\u00a0The Legend of Zelda\u00a0: Breath of the Wild qui avait alors gagn\u00e9 1h30 de jeu entre les deux versions). Le mod\u00e8le OLED annonce sur le papier la m\u00eame autonomie.\nEn revanche, la batterie de la Switch Lite affiche plut\u00f4t entre 3 et 7\u00a0heures d\u2019utilisation.\nSeules les Switch classiques et Switch OLED disposent d\u2019une station d\u2019accueil pour se recharger et se connecter \u00e0 un \u00e9cran. Toutes deux disposent d\u2019un port HDMI, de l\u2019alimentation et de deux ports USB lat\u00e9raux. La nouvelle venue s\u2019enrichit d\u2019un port LAN pour se connecter \u00e0 internet via un c\u00e2ble Ethernet, mais perd son 3e\u00a0port USB \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re. La nouvelle station d\u2019accueil a d\u2019ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 redesign\u00e9e et \u00e9largie pour accueillir la nouvelle Switch avec son \u00e9cran plus large \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger.\nLes trois mod\u00e8les sont compatibles avec le Bluetooth\u00a04.1 et le Wifi\u00a05.\nLa question de l\u2019espace de stockage a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 un sujet sensible avec la Switch. La toute premi\u00e8re doit se contenter de 32\u00a0Go, ce qui va rapidement \u00eatre rempli de donn\u00e9es. Vous pouvez ensuite ajouter une carte microSD (micro SDHC ou microSDXC) pour \u00e9tendre le stockage jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2\u00a0To (carte vendue s\u00e9par\u00e9ment).\nLa nouvelle Switch OLED augmente l\u2019espace embarqu\u00e9 \u00e0 64\u00a0Go avec la possibilit\u00e9 \u00e9galement d\u2019utiliser une carte microSD.\nSi vous aimez la couleur, la Switch Lite risque de r\u00e9colter tous vos suffrages. Elle est d\u00e9sormais disponible en bleu, turquoise, jaune, grise et corail.\nLa Switch OLED sera disponible en blanc avec station d\u2019accueil et Joy-Con assortis, ou en noir avec dock noir et manettes bleu et rouge.\nLa Switch classique est propos\u00e9e en noir avec le choix des Joy-Con noirs ou bien bleu et rouge. Une d\u00e9clinaison aux couleurs d\u2019Animal Crossing\u00a0: New Horizons est \u00e9galement mise en vente.\nTous les jeux \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger sur le Nintendo eShop ou en cartouches sont utilisables sur les Nintendo Switch et Switch OLED. Le prochain Metroid Dread arrive d\u2019ailleurs le 8\u00a0octobre prochain, le jour de sortie du mod\u00e8le OLED. Certains jeux faisant appel aux sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s des Joy-Con peuvent, en revanche, ne pas \u00eatre compatibles avec la Switch Lite.\nSi aucun prix officiel n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 par Nintendo, les pr\u00e9commandes ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des revendeurs partenaires comme Micromania, la Fnac ou Cdiscount. La Nintendo Switch OLED est annonc\u00e9e plus on\u00e9reuse que ses petites soeurs \u00e0 sa sortie le 8 octobre prochain. La Switch premi\u00e8re du nom avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en vente \u00e0 329 euros (sans changement pour la version am\u00e9lior\u00e9e) et on l\u2019a trouve d\u00e9sormais sous les 300 euros. La Switch Lite s\u2019affiche, quant \u00e0 elle, \u00e0 199 euros bien souvent. La Switch OLED est annonc\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de 349,99 euros.\nNintendo a fait le choix de ne pas faire \u00e9voluer les performances de sa Switch.

                    "url": "https://www.imore.com/the-nintendo-switch-oled-model-is-not-the-upgrade-we-wanted",
                    "value": "I really like the Nintendo Switch. As a Nintendo fan for as long as I've been gaming, the Nintendo Switch delivered almost everything I wanted from Nintendo: A steady stream of high-quality first-party games, decent third-party support, and a hybrid nature that actually succeeded in being more than a gimmick.\nWhile I do like the system, it was not without its faults, and the internal specs that were dated in 2017 feel particularly ancient as we steamroll through the backend of 2021. The console's battery life was average at best, and the system's hardware could not keep up with the standards of last-gen hardware and especially not current-gen hardware. Nintendo fans were ready for an upgrade, and the rumors of a Switch Pro fanned the flames of hype on every inch of the internet, reaching a fever pitch during the lead-up to E3 2021. The world waited with bated breath for the fabled Switch Pro, the majestic 4K Switch console that will finally bring the Switch toe-to-toe with current generation standards.\nBut we as a collective gaming conscious failed to consider that Nintendo does things the way it wants to, so the dreams of a 4K-capable Switch were dashed this morning when Nintendo unveiled the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model), a system that doesn't feature 4K and, quite frankly, shouldn't cost $350.\nThe Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) (yes that's the actual name) is, putting it nicely, a modest upgrade to the Switch. The new OLED Switch features a 7-inch OLED screen (just 0.8 inches larger than the current model), a wide kickstand, a dock with an Ethernet port, improved internal speakers, and 64GB of internal storage, doubling the previous version's 32GB of internal storage. That's it \u2014 there have been no changes made to the mediocre battery life and no changes to any internal specs like CPU or RAM, according to The Verge. Nintendo didn't even make any changes to the Joy-Con, so who knows if Joy-Con drift will still be persistent with this new model. It will still hit 1080p when docked and 720p when portable. You get all of this for $350 \u2014 $50 more than the current model price.\nSome will say this is just Nintendo being Nintendo.\nSome will say that this was expected, that this is just Nintendo being Nintendo; from naming conventions to pricing, they have a point. This falls right in line with Nintendo's philosophy of \"lateral thinking with withered technology,\" a phrase first coined by Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi. The company has a tendency to create new devices with cheap, abundant, and dated technology. Look at the original Game Boy, Nintendo's hugely successful handheld. The Game Boy was built from older hardware and didn't receive a true update until the Game Boy Color in 1998, almost 10 years after its debut. You can point to the 3DS, which received six revisions in its lifetime between 2012 and 2020, each doing little to nothing to push the hardware forward. The Switch itself launched with a custom chipset that was already out of date at launch, and rumors of a revision have circled the system as far back as 2018.\nOthers will say that the rumor mill was to blame. It planted the seed of a 4K Super Switch that simply does not exist. However, the rumors here were from reputable sources like Bloomberg, who first reported that the new Switch would receive updated specs. Bloomberg got a lot of it right, including the OLED screen and a release date of this year. Even without the rumors, fans were right to expect a revision in line with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. It's been almost five years since the launch of the Switch and without the help of cloud streaming, the Switch simply cannot support many new third-party games. While it's impressive to see demanding games like Doom Eternal and the Witcher 3 running on what's essentially a tablet, you can practically hear the Switch wheezing as it buckles under 30FPS at sub-720p. It's good enough for some, but not for me.\nThere are folks who think that we don't need Switch games at 4K at 60FPS, and while Nintendo games make up for their lack of graphical prowess with visually distinct art styles, I can't help wonder how much better games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would look and play on stronger hardware. Nintendo fans deserve better modern hardware.\nI'm not alone in my outrage, just a quick search of Twitter reveals a whole lot of underwhelmed and unimpressed people who were expecting a significant upgrade to the Switch's hardware. Technology is improving at a much faster rate than it was when the idea of lateral thinking became Nintendo's MO, and the idea of docking my Switch to play a game that doesn't even run at 1080p is a hard pill to swallow, even harder to swallow in the wake of the next-gen consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Games are becoming more graphically demanding, and even if with the advent of cloud gaming, the Switch needs a significant hardware upgrade, especially if Nintendo wants to continue to enjoy third-party support.\nI play my Switch docked mostly, and Switch owners who mostly play handheld will enjoy the bulk of the OLED's enhancements. The unbelievably bad kickstand has been replaced with a wide adjustable stand, the audio boost is appreciated, and the OLED screen is sure to impress some owners. Along with an Ethernet port (which has been standard for more than a decade now) and a paltry 64GB of internal storage, there's nothing new about this new Switch. There's barely enough here to dissuade someone from getting a Switch Lite, even if they prefer handheld play.\nThe OLED Switch model is not what I wanted; it's not even close. It's hard not to feel dejected, like when grandma asks you for a game and you tell them exactly what you want, and grandma buys you something you already own. The problem is that Nintendo isn't my grandma, and I won't be spending $350 on a revision that barely revises anything. But hey, on the bright side, there's one less revision between me and that sweet, sweet Nintendo Switch Pro \u2014 if that ever happens.\nWould you spend $350 on the new Switch? Sound off in the comments below.\nMore pictures from Weibo allegedly depicting the iPhone 13's new case design show how the new phone will change compared to the iPhone 12.\nYesterday saw England reach the final of Euro 2020 and while many were cheering along in front of their TVs, others were left exasperated after an ITV Hub technical issue meant they couldn't watch the action. Chunks of the second half were missed by those watching on Apple TV boxes \u2014 and they were not happy about it.\nApple's iPhone 12 Pro Max is generally accepted to be the best iPhone for photography and it's shown why that is once again \u2014 although this time it's a slow-motion video that's proving the point.\nHave all the fun of fishing with none of the downsides of going outside!

                    "value": "He tenido que llegar hasta principios de 2019 para encontrar el primer rumor sobre una posible revisi\u00f3n de Nintendo Switch. Por aqu\u00e9l entonces se hablaba de dos nuevos modelos, y ninguno de ellos ha resultado ser la Nintendo Switch OLED con la que nos han sorprendido los nipones.\nPor un lado se hablaba de una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s barata, enfocada al mercado casual, que ese mismo a\u00f1o acabar\u00eda materializ\u00e1ndose en Nintendo Switch Lite. Por el otro, una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s potente con dock para el juego en 4K, pantalla de 1080p para el modo port\u00e1til y una notable mejora en la vida de su bater\u00eda. Un modelo so\u00f1ado que no tardamos en abrazar como Nintendo Switch Pro.\nR\u00edos de tinta e ilusiones han corrido durante los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os sobre esta \u00faltima, pero lo que ped\u00edamos como jugadores no podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s alejado de lo que finalmente recibiremos con esta revisi\u00f3n. Estas son todas las mejoras para Nintendo Switch que se quedaron en nuestra cabeza y que, al menos por ahora, parece que seguir\u00e1n ah\u00ed.\nSi bien es cierto que Nintendo Switch OLED cumple con aquello de mejorar la pantalla de Nintendo Switch, s\u00f3lo lo hace en tama\u00f1o y calidad. De 6,2 pulgadas saltamos a las 7 pulgadas que ofrecer\u00e1n menos marco, mayor contraste y colores m\u00e1s intensos en el modo port\u00e1til, pero la resoluci\u00f3n que alcanza la consola tanto en modo port\u00e1til como en el televisor seguir\u00e1 siendo la misma: 720p y 1080p respectivamente.\nParte de la gracia de esa mejora de resoluci\u00f3n estaba en poder acercarnos a un salto notable en los componentes de la consola, y es que si bien sigue demostrando tener m\u00e1s m\u00fasculo del que presupon\u00edamos en su anuncio, las concesiones en materia de rendimiento y resoluciones empiezan a pasarle factura.\nNo hab\u00eda aqu\u00ed intenci\u00f3n de acercarnos a juegos exclusivos como ya ocurri\u00f3 con New Nintendo 3DS, ni siquiera la opci\u00f3n de alcanzar el 4K apostando por una potencia desmedida, sino a la necesidad de darle algo m\u00e1s de manga a los desarrolladores a la hora de ofrecer la experiencia que tienen en mente.\nParece que la bater\u00eda mejora lo justo para hacer frente al cambio de pantalla, pero lo cierto es que los cambios se quedan justo ah\u00ed. Nintendo Switch OLED se queda en las mismas 4,5 a 9 horas que ya ofrec\u00eda en el modelo base. Y las 5,5 horas que se aventuraban al jugar a The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild como ejemplo se mantienen intactas.\nQuienes se hayan llevado de viaje su Nintendo Switch para jugar en modo port\u00e1til son ya muy conscientes de hasta qu\u00e9 punto la port\u00e1til va justa en ese sentido. No gozar de mejoras, ya no de bater\u00eda, sino de alg\u00fan tipo de modo ahorro, es una aut\u00e9ntica l\u00e1stima.\nLa llegada de nuevos mandos o el mero hecho de acostumbrarse a jugar con el mando Pro ha puesto sobre la mesa la necesidad de darle una vuelta a la ergonom\u00eda de los Joy-Con, que acaban resultando ser demasiado inc\u00f3modos al soportar la m\u00e1quina en el modo port\u00e1til. Ahora lo ser\u00e1n a\u00fan m\u00e1s al aumentarse el peso de la consola, que se mueve levemente de los 398 g originales a los 420 g.\nViendo que la mejora de audio aparec\u00eda en el v\u00eddeo de presentaci\u00f3n de Nintendo Switch OLED, mis esperanzas de acabar viendo un micr\u00f3fono integrado con el que disfrutar de un sistema de comunicaci\u00f3n interno se han mantenido hasta que ha vuelto a aparecer el chat de voz a trav\u00e9s del m\u00f3vil.\nNo deja de resultar curioso que tuvi\u00e9semos micr\u00f3fono en Wii U y sigamos teniendo que tirar de volteretas tecnol\u00f3gicas para poder hablar con nuestros amigos mientras jugamos.\nSe nos iluminaron los ojos cuando a principios de a\u00f1o los dataminers encontraron informaci\u00f3n relativa al uso de auriculares bluetooth sin necesidad de un adaptador USB-C, pero hemos llegado a Nintendo Switch OLED y la posibilidad sigue sin asomar el hocico. El tema no aparece entre las especificaciones t\u00e9cnicas y, sabiendo que ha sido una de las mejoras m\u00e1s reclamadas, resultar\u00eda raro no haberla visto en el tr\u00e1iler de haberse materializado finalmente.\nEn Vidaextra hablamos de..."

Typically, these wireless noise-canceling headphones retail for $80.\nFurther ReadingThe Ars Technica ultimate buying guide for your home office setupWhile we haven't formally reviewed the Soundcore Life Q30s on Ars, we have tested them and found them to be a rare value among sub-$100 wireless headphones. In short,\u00a0the Q30s serve up a lightweight and well-padded design, with tremendous battery life that pushes 40 hours per charge, multidevice pairing, and USB-C charging.\nDon't expect the noise-canceling strength of Sony's WH-1000XM4, but what's here is still effective for the price and plenty capable of reducing a good chunk of external noise, particularly low-end sounds like jet or bus engines. Along those lines, the Q30s' bass-heavy sound won't be for everyone, but Anker makes it possible to tinker with the sound profile through a dedicated app. Anker recently launched a successor to this pair called the Soundcore Life Q35, promising better mic performance and wider Bluetooth codec support, but the headphones currently retail for $130. If you're looking to stay well under $100, the Q30 remains an excellent value.\nIf you don't need another set of headphones, though, our deals roundup also has good prices on Logitech mice and keyboards, PlayStation games and services, Razer accessories, LG OLED TVs, and more.

Retrouvez dans cet article toutes les offres par marchand.\nLes rumeurs concernant un nouveau mod\u00e8le de la Nintendo Switch ont \u00e9norm\u00e9ment circul\u00e9 sur Internet ces derniers mois, mais la firme de Kyoto a maintenant clarifi\u00e9 la chose en officialisant un mod\u00e8le OLED de sa console hybride. L\u2019\u00e9cran n\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs pas la seule am\u00e9lioration de cette nouvelle d\u00e9clinaison et donc le prix final se retrouve impact\u00e9. Sans surprise, ce dernier est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de la Nintendo Switch \u00e0 son lancement en mars 2017.\nLa Nintendo Switch mod\u00e8le OLED sera commercialis\u00e9e au prix de 359,99 euros \u00e0 partir du 8 octobre 2021. Micromania a finalement retir\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9commandes temporairement, mais vous pouvez retrouver ci-dessous les liens vers les futures pages de pr\u00e9commande :\nIl faut savoir que la Nintendo Switch OLED n\u2019est pas le mod\u00e8le Pro tant attendu. Cette nouvelle console hybride semble embarquer la m\u00eame puce Tegra X1+ grav\u00e9e en 7 nm du mod\u00e8le de 2019, assurant une meilleure gestion de l\u2019autonomie que la version 2017. Donc pas de meilleurs graphismes ou de d\u00e9finition en 4K au programme, mais les am\u00e9liorations sont tout de m\u00eame nombreuses.\nLa premi\u00e8re est la plus \u00e9vidente : l\u2019\u00e9cran OLED. Cette Nintendo Switch profite donc des contrastes infinis que l\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019habitude d\u2019appr\u00e9cier sur smartphone, de quoi donner \u00e0 Mario et toute son \u00e9quipe des couleurs encore plus p\u00e9tantes qu\u2019avant. La diagonale est allong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 atteindre 7 pouces et permet par la m\u00eame occasion de r\u00e9duire les bordures autour de l\u2019\u00e9cran tout en conservant \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le m\u00eame gabarit que la Nintendo Switch classique.\nLe dock de la console a quelque peu \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9. On remarque \u00e9videmment la nouvelle couleur blanc p\u00e2le, mais aussi des bords plus arrondis sur la partie sup\u00e9rieure. Derri\u00e8re, le mod\u00e8le OLED a m\u00eame droit \u00e0 un port Ethernet pour am\u00e9liorer les performances de votre connexion Internet, ce qui sera s\u00fbrement tr\u00e8s utile pour le jeu en ligne ou les jeux qui utilisent le cloud, comme Control par exemple.\nCelles et ceux qui appr\u00e9cient leur partie \u00e0 plusieurs sur la table seront ensuite ravis d\u2019apprendre que cette Nintendo Switch OLED embarque d\u00e9sormais une b\u00e9quille bien plus solide que les premiers mod\u00e8les. Cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tend tout le long de la console et est m\u00eame ajustable pour trouver le bon angle de vue. Quelque chose que l\u2019on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu dans le monde des tablettes, avec Microsoft et ses Surface pour ne citer que lui.\nDernier d\u00e9tail qui a son importance : le stockage. La m\u00e9moire interne est doubl\u00e9e et passe donc de 32 \u00e0 64 Go. Et si ce n\u2019est toujours pas assez pour vous, il sera toujours possible d\u2019y ajouter une carte microSD pour \u00e9tendre la capacit\u00e9.\nFan de la culture nippone.

En revanche, il est bon de rappeler aussi que des compromis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits.\nC\u2019est la grande annonce du jour\u00a0: la Nintendo Switch OLED a \u00e9t\u00e9 officialis\u00e9e. Comme son nom l\u2019indique, la grande nouveaut\u00e9 de cette console flambant neuve est sa dalle qui s\u2019appuie sur une technologie d\u2019affichage OLED. Nous croisons r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ce terme\u00a0surtout dans le monde des smartphones, mais aussi dans celui des TV ou des PC. L\u2019annonce de ce nouveau produit est l\u2019occasion d\u2019en rappeler les avantages.\nEn d\u2019autres termes, nous allons voir ensemble pourquoi l\u2019\u00e9cran de la Nintendo Switch OLED sera meilleur que celui de la Nintendo Switch classique.\nL\u2019opposition entre la Nintendo Switch OLED et la version classique de la console revient, en grande partie, \u00e0 confronter les technologies OLED et LCD. La premi\u00e8re, Organic Light-Emitting Diode, exploite des diodes \u00e9lectroluminescentes organiques. Ce qu\u2019il faut comprendre, c\u2019est que chaque diode d\u2019un \u00e9cran OLED \u00e9met sa propre lumi\u00e8re. Pour afficher la couleur noire, une dalle OLED va se contenter de ne pas allumer les pixels concern\u00e9s. Ce point va avoir son importance dans la partie suivante de ce dossier.\nEn face, les \u00e9crans \u00e0 cristaux liquides (LCD) sont utilis\u00e9s massivement dans nos produits technologiques depuis plus longtemps. Leur fonctionnement est bien diff\u00e9rent de l\u2019OLED puisqu\u2019ils ont besoin d\u2019utiliser un syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9tro\u00e9clairage pour \u00e9clairer lesdits cristaux. Gardez en t\u00eate ces explications non exhaustives, elles vont permettre de comprendre ce qui suit.\nLa Nintendo Switch OLED va surtout mettre en avant son meilleur contraste. La dalle OLED affiche de vrais noirs puisque ses pixels noirs sont \u00e9teints, aucune lumi\u00e8re ne les traverse. Avec un affichage LCD, ces m\u00eames pixels noirs restent \u00e9clair\u00e9s puisque la dalle ne peut g\u00e9rer ce qu\u2019elle affiche avec autant de granularit\u00e9.\nAinsi, si vous mettez le m\u00eame fond noir sur des \u00e9crans OLED et LCD et avec la m\u00eame luminosit\u00e9 et que vous les comparez c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te, vous aurez l\u2019impression que le second affiche du gris fonc\u00e9 alors que le premier retranscrira l\u2019image avec bien plus de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9. Si peu de gens se pr\u00eatent r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 ce genre d\u2019exp\u00e9rimentation, beaucoup d\u2019utilisateurs appr\u00e9cieront sans doute le confort visuel am\u00e9lior\u00e9.\nPar contraste, les pixels noirs \u00e9teints vont mieux mettre en valeur toutes les autres couleurs. Sur vos parties de\u00a0Zelda\u00a0: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart\u00a08 Deluxe ou\u00a0Splatoon 2, les sc\u00e8nes para\u00eetront plus vives et donc plus riches sur la Nintendo Switch OLED.\nSi vous avez un smartphone avec \u00e9cran OLED et que vous avez opt\u00e9 pour un ajustement automatique de la luminosit\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re va pouvoir atteindre des sommets lorsque les conditions le n\u00e9cessiteront (dans un environnement tr\u00e8s \u00e9clair\u00e9, sous un soleil qui tape tr\u00e8s fort, etc.). N\u00e9anmoins, si vous r\u00e9glez manuellement ce param\u00e8tre, vous ne pourrez pas monter tr\u00e8s haut, comme si vous vous heurtiez \u00e0 un plafond de verre. C\u2019est vraiment le fait de passer en automatique qui permet de d\u00e9passer les 700 voire parfois les 800\u00a0cd/m\u00b2.\nLe dernier avantage est un peu moins une certitude, mais les \u00e9crans OLED ont tendance \u00e0 proposer une plus large palette de couleurs que leurs homologues en LCD. On peut donc miser sur une meilleure couverture des espaces colorim\u00e9triques tels que le sRGB tr\u00e8s standard et le DCI-P3 plus vaste et difficile \u00e0 g\u00e9rer.\nTout d\u00e9pendra en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la qualit\u00e9 de la dalle qui \u00e9quipera la Nintendo Switch OLED. Les commentaires ci-dessus valent surtout pour des \u00e9crans assez r\u00e9cents, si la console se contente d\u2019un composant un peu d\u00e9pass\u00e9, cette am\u00e9lioration passera sans doute \u00e0 la trappe.\nNous avons pass\u00e9 en revue les am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 attendre sur l\u2019\u00e9cran de la Nintendo Switch OLED. Cela ne doit pas nous emp\u00eacher de penser aux petites concessions qu\u2019il faudra aussi potentiellement faire.\u00a0Il y en a surtout deux et elles sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019\u00e9cran.\nLa Nintendo Switch OLED poss\u00e8de un \u00e9cran de 7\u00a0pouces, contre une taille de 6,2\u00a0pouces sur la console originale sortie en 2017 en France, mais la d\u00e9finition HD de 1280 x 720\u00a0pixels reste inchang\u00e9e. Math\u00e9matiquement, la Nintendo Switch OLED va donc proposer une moins bonne r\u00e9solution. Pour rappel, la d\u00e9finition repr\u00e9sente le nombre de pixels dans un \u00e9cran tandis que la r\u00e9solution d\u00e9signe la densit\u00e9 de pixels qu\u2019il y a dedans. En agrandissant la taille d\u2019un \u00e9cran sans en changer la d\u00e9finition, on se retrouve forc\u00e9ment avec un nombre moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 de pixels par point.\nDans notre exemple du jour, la Nintendo Switch OLED tombe \u00e0 un petit peu moins de 210 ppp seulement, soit une baisse de plus de 11 % par rapport aux 237 ppp environ de la premi\u00e8re Switch. Au quotidien, cela veut dire que vous aurez beaucoup plus de risques de distinguer les pixels sur l\u2019\u00e9cran de votre console neuve en la tenant \u00e0 une vingtaine de centim\u00e8tres de vos yeux.\nCela ne devrait pas arriver tous les jours, mais ce n\u2019est jamais agr\u00e9able.\nPar ailleurs, \u00e0 d\u00e9finition \u00e9gale, une dalle OLED peut \u00eatre moins bonne qu\u2019une dalle LCD.\u00a0La plupart des dalles OLED n\u2019utilisent pas une matrice RGB o\u00f9 chaque pixel est compos\u00e9 de trois sous-pixels rouge, vert et bleu. \u00c0 la place, on trouve plut\u00f4t des matrices Pentile o\u00f9 chaque pixel est divis\u00e9 de deux sous-pixels seulement :\u00a0 un sous-pixel vert et un gros sous-pixel bleu ou rouge.\nSi vous \u00eates un peu perdu, retenez que les matrices RGB offrent un affichage plus fin, plus pr\u00e9cis. Pour compenser, les dalles OLED de nos smartphones vont souvent chercher des d\u00e9finitions plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es afin d\u2019\u00e9viter de donner l\u2019impression qu\u2019il y a des sortes de trous dans l\u2019\u00e9cran. Avec une d\u00e9finition qui reste en 720p, la Nintendo Switch OLED pourrait \u00eatre confront\u00e9e \u00e0 ce souci.\nFinalement, on regrettera surtout que la Nintendo Switch OLED n\u2019aille pas chercher une d\u00e9finition de 1920 x 1080 pixels, mais la vieille puce Tegra X1 \u2014 la m\u00eame que sur le mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u2014 n\u2019est vraisemblablement pas assez puissante pour supporter une telle optimisation.\nOn imagine que Nintendo a voulu limiter autant que possible la hausse du prix de vente de sa console. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les sp\u00e9culations peuvent aller bon train quant \u00e0 la sortie d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable version Pro int\u00e9grant un \u00e9cran 1080p et affichant m\u00eame des jeux en 4K via le dock. Ne parions cependant pas sur un tel mod\u00e8le avant au moins un an.\nPour rappel, la Nintendo Switch OLED sera commercialis\u00e9e le 8\u00a0octobre.

Mucho se ha hablado de una posible Nintendo Switch Pro, la cual mejorar\u00eda las prestaciones del sistema h\u00edbrido de Nintendo tras su lanzamiento en el a\u00f1os 2017.\nAhora, ya la Nintendo acaba de anunciar la revisi\u00f3n de su consola port\u00e1til, con un nuevo modelo que llegar\u00e1 el pr\u00f3ximo 8 de octubre y que contar\u00e1 con una pantalla OLED de 7 pulgadas y capacidad para hasta 64GB en sus tripas para alojar todos los t\u00edtulos posibles. Su nombre es Nintendo Switch OLED.\nSi bien el precio no se ha confirmado en euros, la p\u00e1gina web oficial de Nintendo en ingl\u00e9s arroja la cifra de 350 d\u00f3lares. Un aspecto que se ha mejorado es la parte trasera de la pantalla, la cual ahora cuenta con un soporte ancho ajustable. Esto permite contar con un \u00e1ngulo m\u00e1s apropiado seg\u00fan nuestros gustos.\nLa Nintendo Switch OLED dispone de dos puertos USB, un puerto HDMI para conectarse a la pantalla que usemos y un nuevo puerto LAN por cable, lo cual permite disfrutar de las partidas online de forma directa. Cuenta, adem\u00e1s, con altavoces integrados con audio optimizado tanto para el modo port\u00e1til como sobremesa.\nDe esta forma, la consola define tres modos de uso. Televisor, el cl\u00e1sico en el que colocamos el sistema en el dock para que la se\u00f1al se emita por la pantalla; el sobremesa, que es el que usaremos con la pantalla fuera del dock y los Joy-Con en nuestras manos mientras descansa sobre el soporte y el \u00faltimo, el port\u00e1til con todo al completo en nuestras manos.\nHabr\u00e1 dos versiones disponibles, la Nintendo Switch OLED blanca, con mandos blancos, cuerpo negro y base blanca. Por otro lado, podremos escoger la Nintendo Switch OLED con los colores m\u00e1s habituales rojo y azul, pero un solo Joy-Con.\nLas buenas noticias son que todas las versiones previas de los Joy-Con podr\u00e1n funcionar en la Nintendo Switch OLED, al igual que el cat\u00e1logo completo de videojuegos. Si decides dar el paso y saltar de versi\u00f3n, podr\u00e1s transferir tus juegos digitales y datos de guardado sin problemas.

                    "value": "Products featured are independently selected by our editorial team and we may earn a commission from purchases made from our links; the retailer may also receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\nNintendo stealthily announced the Switch (OLED Model) via a YouTube video posted earlier today.\nRumors about an updated Switch have floated around for years, and some suggested it would even be announced before this year\u2019s E3 conference, but the news dropped a little later. It will be available on October 8 for $349, and Nintendo hasn\u2019t announced when it\u2019ll be up for preorder.\nThe biggest difference between the OLED Model and the standard Nintendo Switch is its display. This new version has a seven inch screen, which is slightly larger than the 6.2 inch display in the current Switch. This new screen uses OLED technology, which is capable of displaying colors and contrast a lot more vividly.\nThe second biggest difference is that Nintendo bumped up the Switch OLED Model\u2019s internal storage from 32GB to 64GB, which is great if you like to play digital games. Nintendo also upgraded the Switch\u2019s speakers, and made its kickstand wider, which will allow the console to rest more securely on a table. This updated kickstand can also be adjusted to more angles than before.\nThese are nice quality of life improvements that will make Nintendo\u2019s new console better in handheld mode, but the differences are pretty subtle. Its screen has the same 1280 x 720 resolution, the battery life hasn\u2019t been extended, and Nintendo is continuing to use the custom Nvidia chip that\u2019s in the current Switch.\nWhen it\u2019s docked (connected to a TV), the experience of using the Nintendo Switch OLED Model is identical to the current version. It can still play games at a resolution of 1080P at 60 frames per second. Nintendo did upgrade the Switch OLED dock to include an Ethernet port, which is nice if you play online games, or download larger titles at home.\nRumors suggested Nintendo was preparing to show off a \u201cSwitch Pro,\u201d which could play games at 4K (twice as high as 1080) thanks to an upgraded chip. That new chip was also said to have improved the performance of older Switch titles that the current version struggled to play.\nNintendo is certainly working on a totally new generation game console (whether it\u2019s a more powerful Switch or a completely different system is yet to be seen,) but this OLED model isn\u2019t it. If you\u2019re contemplating whether to upgrade from a current Nintendo Switch, or waiting to get your first one, here are our suggestions.\nIf you treat the Nintendo Switch like a home console, you can safely skip this upgrade at stick with the current LCD model. If you mostly play the Switch in handheld mode, and have an original launch console, it may be worth springing for the Switch OLED Model for a couple of reasons.\nThe jump in color accuracy between an LCD and OLED screen is high, and having a larger display makes a big difference when you play games on-the-go. Plus, Nintendo Switch consoles released before 2019 have substantially worse battery life.\nWhile the Nintendo Switch OLED Model may not have been the powerhouse console some gamers were waiting for, it is an upgraded version of the system. It won\u2019t compete with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 or Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Series S/X in terms of raw performance, but it extends Nintendo\u2019s lead in the handheld gaming market even further.\nIf anything, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model proves that the company got just about everything right when it launched the original model in 2017. The LCD model of the Switch is available right now for $299.99, and it\u2019s still the version we recommend for most people.\nIt can play the same library of games at the same level of performance as the Switch OLED Model, and you can get it today.\nWant more Rolling Stone?

Finally, after years of waiting, we get a new Nintendo Switch refresh that isn\u2019t necessarily the Pro variant we were waiting for, but at least it comes with some decent upgrades and a new price tag that won\u2019t break the bank. And the best part is that this is no rumors, as Nintendo has officially announced the Nintendo Switch OLED model.\nToday, Nintendo has officially announced its new Nintendo Switch OLED model, which will be available for purchase on October 8, 2021. It will start at $350, which is just $50 more expensive than the original Switch and $150 more than the Switch Lite.\nThe new Switch comes with a couple of significant upgrades from the original variant. First, we find a larger 7-inch OLED screen that will deliver a better viewing experience, with vivid colors and crisp contrast when playing away from home or on the road. This gets better when you place your console on a desk, as it also comes with a wide adjustable stand that will allow for easy viewing in tabletop mode. Its new dock with a wired LAD port will make everything more convenient when playing in TV mode, as a LAN connection is better and more stable than WiFi connections. You will also get enhanced audio and 64GB of internal storage.\nNow, remember that the regular Nintendo Switch comes with a 6.2-inch LCD display. Unfortunately, it is limited to 32GB storage space, which means you will most likely have to be uninstalling games after you\u2019re done with them (if you don\u2019t have an external SSD). Also, it doesn\u2019t feature the built-in LAD port, and if you wanted this feature, you needed to get a USB-to-Ethernet adapter if you want wired internet connectivity. So yeah, an extra $50 bucks for a larger OLED display, better sound, and a sick new color option is worth it. What about you? Do you want to get your hands on a new Nintendo Switch OLED model?

Instead, it has been given the altogether less exciting title: Nintendo Switch OLED Model. And if the immediate fan reaction is anything to go by, the specs are as disappointing as the name.\nAfter months of speculation, Nintendo finally announced the \"new' console today, and it hasn't exactly been met with rapturous applause. Spoiler alert: if a slightly improved screen isn't that important to you, you might want to stick to these brilliant Nintendo Switch deals.\nMeet the newest entry to the #NintendoSwitch family! Nintendo Switch (OLED model) brings the versatility of the Nintendo Switch experience with a vibrant 7-inch OLED screen, a wide adjustable stand, and more. Nintendo Switch (OLED model) releases on 10/8.https://t.co/zRpGxakJDn pic.twitter.com/Tsc55r35ayJuly 6, 2021\nSo what's new? As the name suggests, it's all about the screen. At 7 inches, it's slightly larger than the standard model, which is 6.2 inches. And as opposed to LCD, an OLED display means brighter colours and sharper contrast.\nAlso new is bumped-up storage (now at 64GB), a wired LAN port, enhanced speakers and a wider kickstand. Oh, and a new (and admittedly fetching) white colour. And that's about it. There were several features rumoured for the so-called Switch Pro, including a new Nvidia chip, 4K output to TVs and improved battery, none of which have materialised. What we've ended up with is a device that's pretty much the same internally, with a better display. And it seems fans are more than a little disappointed.\nDude.**Dude.**Are you serious? After all that build-up, and after 4 years... there is not even remotely a performance increase? Nothing? Just... just a better handheld screen, a measly 32 more GB, and a better stand. And a trailer to demonstrate the wonderful casual gameplay. https://t.co/IRUAMaOgjfJuly 6, 2021\nAll those switch pro talking was just a switch with a bigger screen lmao.No hardware improvements.No 4K No DLSSJust Pain. https://t.co/MTCXKNwWxlJuly 6, 2021\nStill, it's entirely possible that Nintendo has an actual Switch Pro up its sleeve \u2013 but today's announcement suggests that won't be arriving any time soon. In the meantime, fans will have to make do with a brighter screen. (And new kickstand. Let's not forget the new kickstand.) Thankfully, where the Switch truly excels is in the quality of its games \u2013 and at least all of the best Nintendo Switch games will look a little better on the Switch Pro, sorry, Switch OLED model.\nDaniel Piper is senior news editor at Creative Bloq.

Learn more\nAfter months of speculation, we finally know what Nintendo's mid-gen refresh of the Switch looks like \u2013 and it's called the Nintendo Switch OLED.\nNintendo made the announcement on July 6 on its official Twitter account, after many had speculated that the new console would be revealed before or during E3 2021 in June.\nThe specs of the Nintendo Switch OLED align with some of the rumors we\u2019d been hearing about the updated console, and it comes with a 7-inch OLED screen, which is larger than the Switch\u2019s 6.2-inch LCD display. Here's everything you need to know about Nintendo's new hybrid console.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED will be available on October 8, 2021, and it costs $349.99 / \u00a3309.99 / AU$539. The current Nintendo Switch costs $299.99 in the US, \u00a3279.99 in the UK, and $449 in Australia, while the Nintendo Switch Lite, which is a handheld-only device, costs $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$329.95.\nIt means the Nintendo Switch OLED costs $50 / \u00a330 / AU$90 more than the standard Switch model, which isn\u2019t a massive premium to pay for the new features on offer.\nPre-orders for the Nintendo Switch OLED are now live at numerous retailers. Check out our pre-order page for the US, UK and Australia, so you don't miss out when the Switch OLED releases on October 8, 2021.\nWe know that the Nintendo Switch OLED\u2019s main appeal is its organic light emitting diode display, or OLED for short. OLED is widely regarded as one of the best display technologies around, as unlike an LCD screen, it doesn\u2019t rely on a backlight to display images. Instead, it displays images using light emitted by each individual pixel, which means you can get perfect inky blacks and higher contrast levels.\nThe display size of the Nintendo Switch OLED is also larger than the original Switch\u2019s LCD screen. It\u2019s now 7 inches, which should give you a bit more real estate when you\u2019re huddled over playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with friends, and provide some added immersion when playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 when that game eventually releases sometime in 2022.\nSome surprises come in the form of a wider, adjustable stand, and enhanced audio quality; however, it doesn't look like the Nintendo Switch OLED will support spatial audio tech like Dolby Atmos. Instead, it appears that the speakers on the unit itself have merely been upgraded for a better experience when you're playing in handheld or tabletop mode.\nThe wider kick stand is more akin to something we'd find on a Microsoft Surface, and means that, when playing in tabletop mode, it'll be much easier to find the perfect position to play.\nAnother new addition is wired LAN support, which will come as a relief to those who feel Nintendo Switch\u2019s online games aren\u2019t the most stable or reliable when played over Wi-Fi. It\u2019ll also benefit titles like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Splatoon 3, the latter of which is due to release in 2022.\nThankfully, another area where the Nintendo Switch OLED improves over the original is internal storage. The Nintendo Switch OLED has 64GB of storage compared to the 32GB on the original Switch model, and there\u2019s still support for compatible microSD cards.\nThe Nintendo Switch dock has also received a subtle upgrade, as it now sports rounded edges for a more modern-looking design, and comes in an off-white, which matches the new white color scheme of the Nintendo Switch OLED. The console is also available in the classic Neon Blue/Red color combo with a black dock.\nLike the previous model, the new Switch dock will be available to purchase separately from the Nintendo online store (it won't be sold at retail) and will work with the original Switch. The old dock cost $60, so we expect the new dock to be priced similarly.\nSurprisingly, no. One of the biggest features the Nintendo Switch Pro was tipped to have was the option to output at 4K resolution when docked, but the Switch OLED will only output at 1080p, just like the regular Switch. This seems like a big missed opportunity for Nintendo, and might make the upgrade a little harder to justify for some.\nIt\u2019s likely that the Nintendo Switch OLED display will stick to the 720p output of the original Switch too, as it means existing Switch software won\u2019t have to be upgraded. This means that rumors of Nvidia DLSS support, which using AI upscaling to help games achieve 4K, is off the cards.\nTargeting a resolution of 4K resolution could have also led to the console being more expensive, which is why Nintendo may have opted to stick with the original 720p output in handheld mode and 1080p when docked.\nCan all Nintendo Switch titles be played on Nintendo Switch OLED? Absolutely. The Switch OLED is essentially a fancier Nintendo Switch, so it means means that every Switch game is compatible. However, Nintendo notes that some game experiences with the Toy-Con accessories from the Nintendo Labo series may differ due to the Switch OLED's larger screen.\nExisting Switch accessories will also work with the Nintendo Switch OLED model, according to Nintendo, but naturally things like screen protectors wouldn't be compatible due to the Switch OLED's larger screen.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is essentially the Nintendo Switch Pro that has been heavily rumored for quite some time. The technical specifications all line up with what we\u2019ve heard previously, though the biggest outlier is the lack of 4K resolution support when docked.\nThe Switch OLED announcement has been met with disappointment by some who were hoping Nintendo would follow a similar strategy to Microsoft and Sony, who both released more powerful consoles in the form of the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro during the last generation. This allowed existing games to receive resolution bumps and better performance, which would admittedly be welcome for some Switch titles.\nIt\u2019s unlikely, then, that Nintendo will announce another Switch model anytime soon, but an analyst believes that Switch Pro might still be in the works. We'd advise tempering your expectations, though, as a more powerful Nintendo Switch model suddenly seems a long way off.\nAdam is a Senior Gaming Writer at TechRadar.

                    "value": "The fourth and final day of E3 2021 has arrived, and we\u2019re hoping that Nintendo will close out the digital event with an exciting showcase of new games for the Switch. The Nintendo Direct begins Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET, and according to the company, we can expect to receive \u201croughly 40 minutes of information focused exclusively on Nintendo Switch games mainly releasing in 2021.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll get any news about the rumored Nintendo Switch Pro during this live stream, but maybe Nintendo just wants to surprise us.\nWithout question, the two games that Nintendo fans are most interested in learning more about are Metroid Prime 4 and the follow-up to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The long-awaited Metroid Prime sequel was announced alongside Bayonetta 3 back in 2017, and we\u2019ve heard hardly anything about either game since. E3 2021 seems like as good a time as any to correct that.\nAs for Breath of the Wild 2, we got our first taste of the sequel at E3 2019, but Nintendo did not have anything to say about a potential release date. It appeared to be running on the same engine as the original game, so maybe that will speed up development. At the moment, Nintendo has very few big Switch titles coming this holiday season aside from Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Pokemon Shining Pearl, but a new Zelda game would definitely be one of the biggest launches of 2021.\nThe first-party Switch games that are currently confirmed for 2021 include Mario Golf: Super Rush, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, and two Pokemon remasters. We also know that Pokemon Legends: Arceus and Splatoon 3 are set to release in 2022, but the lineup is looking increasingly thin, especially compared to what Microsoft and Sony have in store for the coming months.\nOf course, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t talk about the new Switch model that has been popping up in leaks and rumors for the past several months.\nAll signs point to Nintendo working on an upgraded Switch console with a 7-inch OLED display and 4K graphics, but the company made it clear that this showcase will be about software, not hardware. The so-called Switch Pro was initially expected to be unveiled before E3 2021 began, but that clearly didn\u2019t come to pass. An announcement is coming, but we might have to wait until next month.\nIn the meantime, you can watch the E3 2021 Nintendo Direct live in the YouTube video above to see all of the new Switch games that Nintendo plans to release before the end of the year.\nJacob started covering video games and technology in college as a hobby, but it quickly became clear to him that this was what he wanted to do for a living.

                    "value": "All the latest on the retailers stocking the new Nintendo Switch OLED as soon as it's\u00a0available.\nWe've been sifting through the rumours for months about a new model but it's finally been announced: the Nintendo Switch OLED is coming this October. Er, wait a second, this isn't exactly the upgraded Nintendo Switch Pro that we expected to be revealed before E3, but a new iteration of the existing Switch console with an improved OLED screen, superior kickstand, refined dock and internal storage boost.\nThis list of meagre upgrades may not sound all that exciting for anyone who's owned a Nintendo Switch for years and was hoping for a performance jump. For those who do not yet own a Switch console, though, this new OLED version is a solid place to start.\nWhether you're going to upgrade anyway or finally take the plunge with the console-handheld hybrid, we'll do our best to help you secure a Nintendo Switch OLED pre-order as soon as they become available right here.\nNow, if it's anything like the recent endeavour for PS5 stock and Xbox Series X stock we could be in for quite a struggle. However, as the Nintendo Switch OLED is only a very minor revision to existing hardware, it might not be as challenging to place a pre-order or find where to buy it.\nNevertheless, we'll be using this page to bring you all the retailers who are offering a pre-order for the Nintendo Switch OLED.\nPre-orders for the Nintendo Switch OLED are starting to go live at a number of stores.\nCurrently, in the UK, you can buy the new console from Smyths Toys. The Nintendo Store is only allowing you to register your interest, while Amazon has product pages listed but nothing available to buy. Equally, there are a few listings in the US at Best Buy, Gamestop and B&H Photo but it's not possible to place a pre-order just yet. Lastly, a few European stores have pre-orders available.\nWe'll continue tracking the availability of both the White and Neon Red/Neon Blue models as soon as they are available to buy below.\nWith the release of the Nintendo Switch OLED, a handful of new accessories will follow in support of the new console.\nCurrently, we've spotted a new Nintendo Switch Carrying Case & Screen Protector which comes in the new white colour scheme and includes a pair of screen protectors. One is for the larger screen on the Switch OLED, while the other is for the standard Switch.\nThe OLED Nintendo Switch will be released on 8th October. It will cost \u00a3309.99 in the UK, \u20ac364.99 in Europe and $349.99 in the US.\nThat's still considerably cheaper than a PS5 or Xbox Series X - but a price increase compared to the original Switch does seem believable considering the upgrade to the OLED screen and the small improvements elsewhere. The specifics of that are detailed below.\nAs the name suggests, the Nintendo Switch OLED will feature a larger 7-inch OLED screen. This will give you a brighter and more vivid image while playing games in handheld mode but still run in 720p resolution - just like the current Switch model.\nThe new console also includes a wide adjustable kickstand. This is a significant improvement over the flimsy leg you can flick out of the existing Switch model, as it offers much more flexible viewing angles and a more secure stand for the console when undocked and in tabletop mode.\nOther new features include a new dock that comes with a wired LAN port to give you a more stable internet connection when playing in TV mode, enhanced onboard speakers for better audio and a bump to 64GB of internal memory for game storage. That can still be upgraded further with a Nintendo Switch SD card as your games library grows.\nWhile it's not much, this is still more of a considerable upgrade to the existing Switch tech than the last iteration. The biggest difference there was improved battery life and slightly better Joy-Con controllers - though many did still suffer from drift. There's no word on whether that's been improved for the OLED Switch, but considering all existing Joy-Con controllers can be used with the console it doesn't seem likely.\nFor a more in-depth specification breakdown, you can visit the dedicated OLED Switch page from Nintendo.\nFor all the rumours still floating around about the other suspected Nintendo hardware upgrade you can browse through our dedicated guide that covers all the rumoured Switch Pro features we've heard about so far.\nBased on the announcement from Nintendo, these are the significant differences between the Nintendo Switch OLED and existing models of the console.\nThe first one is the screen. As explained above, the Switch OLED has a 7-inch OLED screen that outputs at 720p resolution. This is larger than both the 6.2 inch LCD on the current Switch and the 5.5 LCD screen on the Switch Lite, though the resolution remains the same. However, the OLED screen will offer improvements in other areas, such as higher contrast and overall better image quality.\nEven though there is a bump in screen size, it won't increase the size of the overall console. Instead, the bezel (that's the area between the screen and the edge of the system itself) will be made thinner. That means that all existing Joy-Con controllers will be supported by the OLED Switch console.\nThat's about it for the most impactful difference between the Switch models. Of course, the OLED Switch also has a few handy quality of life improvements such as the wider kickstand and 64GB internal memory (that's double the 32GB in other models). And then there's the enhanced audio in handheld mode, which is great if you play a lot away from the TV.\nYes, the Switch OLED is compatible with all existing Joy-Con controllers and Switch accessories.\nHowever, Nintendo has stated that \"there may be differences in game experience with some of the Toy-Con accessories in the Nintendo Labo series, due to differences in console and screen size between Nintendo Switch (OLED model) and Nintendo Switch\".\nNow, this doesn't mean that those Labo games won't work with the OLED Switch, but the larger screen could impact your experience with them. Just something to be cautious of if you use Labo a lot or will pick it up in the future..\nMost likely? Honestly, this OLED Switch announcement has really dulled a lot of the excitement surrounding the rumoured Switch Pro. It seems many who were looking forward to the potential improvements that were supposed to come to the upgraded model are unsure what to make of it.\nMany of the features included in reports about the Switch Pro have actually materialised on the OLED Switch - mostly notably the rumoured OLED screen. Apart from, of course, the big one - that is a jump to 4K resolution in TV mode through Nvidia's DLSS technology.\nWhere does that leave us, then? A bit lost, actually. There is still a chance that the Nintendo Switch Pro - or whatever it ends up being called - is still coming. Those thoughts have just been muted for the time being. Perhaps it's being primed for a launch alongside Breath of the Wild 2?\nWith the OLED Switch established, it would be reasonable to assume that Nintendo would eventually discontinue the existing Nintendo Switch model. The better screen and increased internal memory could eventually be positioned as the norm, with the Switch Lite fulfilling the role of the budget, handheld-only option.\nStill, that might present a good opportunity to nab yourself an incredible Nintendo Switch deal if the old console is also discounted to clear stock. Incredibly, it would be the first time the Nintendo Switch has been given a permanent price cut since launch. Previously, we've had to scrabble around for a Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal in order to find any significant savings. That might change in 2021!\nHopefully everything we've covered here has got you prepared for when Nintendo Switch OLED pre-orders go live!

On peut aussi y voir un moyen de r\u00c3\u00a9pondre \u00c3\u00a0 la PS5 de Sony et \u00c3\u00a0 la Xbox Series X de Microsoft, m\u00c3\u00aame s\u00e2\u0080\u0099il ne s\u00e2\u0080\u0099agira pas d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une Switch plus puissante, car Nintendo a clairement pr\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9 privil\u00c3\u00a9gier le confort.\nCette nouvelle Switch OLED s\u00e2\u0080\u0099adresse \u00c3\u00a0 des joueurs plus exigeants qui seraient pr\u00c3\u00aats \u00c3\u00a0 mettre quelques euros de plus pour jouer dans de meilleures conditions. Cette technologie d\u00e2\u0080\u0099affichage permet d\u00e2\u0080\u0099obtenir des noirs plus profonds et des couleurs de meilleure tenue. Elle sera une alli\u00c3\u00a9e de taille pour mettre en avant une production ambitieuse comme The Legend of Zelda\u00c2\u00a0: Breath of the Wild 2, qui fera encore plus briller ses graphismes.\nContrairement \u00c3\u00a0 la Nintendo Switch Lite, la Switch OLED n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est pas destin\u00c3\u00a9e \u00c3\u00a0 un seul usage. Comme la Switch normale, elle propose du jeu nomade et pourra \u00c3\u00aatre reli\u00c3\u00a9e \u00c3\u00a0 son t\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9viseur avec un dock fourni (d\u00c3\u00a9sormais \u00c3\u00a9quip\u00c3\u00a9 d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un port Ethernet). Nintendo aurait pu opter pour une utilisation exclusivement salon, mais ne l\u00e2\u0080\u0099a pas fait. Notons que le constructeur a \u00c3\u00a9galement am\u00c3\u00a9lior\u00c3\u00a9 le rendu sonore et retravaill\u00c3\u00a9 la b\u00c3\u00a9quille pour qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099elle soit plus pratique et plus grande, comme on peut le voir sur les images.\nNintendo aurait \u00c3\u00a9galement pu rendre la Switch Pro obligatoire pour certains jeux gourmands, comme ce fut le cas pour la\u00c2\u00a0New Nintendo 3DS avec\u00c2\u00a0Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. La firme nippone ne r\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a8te pas cette erreur et la Switch continuera de faire tourner les nouveaut\u00c3\u00a9s.\u00c2\u00a0La Switch OLED est simplement ce qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099a \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9 la PS4 Pro pour la PS4 et la Xbox One X pour la Xbox One\u00c2\u00a0: un mod\u00c3\u00a8le de milieu de cycle de vie avec des prestations sup\u00c3\u00a9rieures.\nLa Switch OLED sera disponible le 8 octobre 2021 au prix de 349.99 dollars (sans doute 350 euros chez nous). Deux coloris seront propos\u00c3\u00a9s\u00c2\u00a0: blancs ou bleu n\u00c3\u00a9on/rouge n\u00c3\u00a9on.\nLa science est un projet coop\u00c3\u00a9ratif qui se transmet entre les g\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9rations."

                    "value": "Aplicaciones, marketing y noticias en la web.\nDesde 2005.\nYa hab\u00eda pasado un tiempo desde que supimos por \u00faltima vez cu\u00e1l podr\u00eda ser el sucesor del Nintendo Switch. La firma japonesa hab\u00eda mantenido en secreto este proyecto, pero desde hace unos d\u00edas han estado sonando diferentes noticias y hoy ya tenemos algunas luces del lanzamiento de dicho dispositivo.\nA continuaci\u00f3n daremos un abrebocas sobre las especificaciones t\u00e9cnicas, dise\u00f1o, nombre, precio y disponibilidad de la consola que puede ser una buena competencia para la XBOX y PlayStation 5.\nLa ola de rumores han indicado que podr\u00edamos ver gr\u00e1ficos compatibles con 4K, en lugar de 1080p, que es la resoluci\u00f3n que soporta la Nintendo Switch actual. Para ello hay que mejorar el procesador Nvidia Tegra X1 Plus y combinarlo con un aumento de escala de AI, as\u00ed de esta forma, tendr\u00edamos gr\u00e1ficos similares a lo visto en la PlayStation 5, o como m\u00ednimo, los de la PlayStation 4 Pro.\nIgualmente, el \u00e1rea de almacenamiento tiene por ley que aumentar. Y cuando decimos por ley es que, por ejemplo, la Nintendo Switch fue lanzada hace 4 a\u00f1os con 32 GB de memoria de almacenamiento, algo que a d\u00eda de hoy tiene que ser reemplazado por 64 GB, o mejor a\u00fan, por 128 GB.\nEl apartado de la bater\u00eda es otro que tiene que dar un salto de mejora. En la versi\u00f3n actual de la consola tenemos una bater\u00eda interna de 4.310mAh, que puede proporcionar unas 6 horas de autonom\u00eda en promedio. Con esto, sin ser muy exigentes, Nintendo podr\u00eda dar un par de horas de autonom\u00eda de m\u00e1s.\nPor otra parte, en lo que a dise\u00f1o se refiere, nos encontrar\u00edamos con mejoras en la pantalla, pasando de ser LCD a OLED (estoy tambi\u00e9n ayudar\u00eda a mejorar la duraci\u00f3n de la bater\u00eda). De igual forma podr\u00edamos estar viendo base para conectar la consola al TV y botones adicionales en los Joy-Con, lo cual no es pedir demasiado dado que se trata del hermano mayor de la versi\u00f3n original.\nDesde el portal Android Authority aseguran que un precio que se ha venido comentado es de 399 d\u00f3lares. Este coste por la consola a\u00fan es m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico en comparaci\u00f3n con la Xbox One X y la PlayStation 5, y supone 100 d\u00f3lares m\u00e1s con respecto a la Nintendo Switch.\nAdem\u00e1s de lo anterior, si tuvi\u00e9ramos que dar una fecha de lanzamiento de la Nintendo Switch Pro, nos gustar\u00eda apostar a la \u00e9poca navide\u00f1a, e incluso a comienzos de 2022\u2026 veremos qu\u00e9 hace la firma nipona para ofrecer un dispositivo a la altura y con buen precio.\nVenezolano especialista en encontrar las mejores apps para realizar las m\u00e1s diversas tareas. Estudiante y apasionado de la tecnolog\u00eda m\u00f3vil, se encarga de realizar listas y reviews de juegos, as\u00ed como de dar consejos de todo tipo a los usuarios m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes de m\u00f3viles.\nBlog de Tecnolog\u00eda con 15 a\u00f1os de vida.

Learn more\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED was announced on July 6, and it's the fourth major release in the Switch generation of consoles.\nFirst there was the original Switch in 2017, then the Switch Lite with non-removable controllers in 2019. And the refreshed original Nintendo Switch with improved battery life and a new CPU, again in 2019.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED is the most exciting upgrade to this handheld series to date, however. Why? Well, the clue is in the name. This new version has an OLED screen, similar to the displays of top phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21.\nIn this piece we\u2019ll look at why the Switch OLED is better than the LCD original, and the other upgrades you get in the Nintendo Switch OLED.\nNintendo has priced the Switch OLED at $350 / \u00a3309 / AU$539, with a release date set for October 8, 2021. That's $50 / \u00a330 / AU$90 more than the original Switch was priced at, which cost $300 / \u00a3279 / AU$449.\nNintendo Switch OLED pre-orders are now live. Releasing on October 8, 2021, the Switch OLED brings some much-needed upgrades to the popular hybrid console. You get a 7-inch OLED screen, a better kickstand and speakers, plus 64GB of internal storage.\nNintendo has confirmed the Switch OLED will be available from October 8, but stock is likely to be limited due to the ongoing global semiconductor shortage. This has impacted both the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles since they launched in November 2020, so you might want to pre-order Nintendo's console or risk missing out.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED looks similar to the original Switch and its 2019 refresh. It has removable Joy-Cons, the same button layout, and even comes in the familiar bright Neon Blue and Red color scheme.\nHowever, the version you'll see most online in the run-up to the Switch OLED's release is the new White version. This more sedate, grown-up color scheme is the sort of garb we expected to see the rumored Nintendo Switch Pro dressed up in. It may not be the Nintendo Switch Pro, but this is the closest we'll get for now and many of the leaks surrounding the Pro line up here.\nThere are some other important design changes. The thick bezels of the original Switch's display have been significantly trimmed down, and the 6.2-inch LCD panel has been replaced with a vibrant 7-inch OLED panel.\nThis gives the new Switch a less dated appearance and means there is no significant difference in size with the new model, despite the use of a larger screen. It's 0.1 inches longer, at 9.5 x 0.55 x 4 inches (W x D x H).\nThis means that any Joy-Con controllers you bought will work just fine with the Nintendo Switch OLED. The new console uses the same 'rail' system for such accessories.\nNintendo has reworked the Switch's feeble kickstand to make it much less fragile, too. It now runs across much of the console's back, which should keep it upright more securely. The stand is more adjustable as well, allowing for different display angles when playing in tabletop mode.\nYou wouldn't know it from a glance but Nintendo has also redesigned the Switch OLED's speakers. They still sit on the bottom of the handheld, one to each side, but Nintendo promises \"enhanced\" audio.\nWe hope for slightly better low frequency output and increased maximum volume, which we'll take a closer look at when we get a Nintendo Switch OLED in for review.\nAs before the OLED Switch comes with a dock, to let you play games on your TV. However,\u00a0it does not offer the 4K output many hoped for in a Nintendo Switch Pro console. Playing docked and 1080p remains the max output resolution, and the display is 720p when playing in handheld mode.\nAn Ethernet (LAN) port is the extra we do get. You take a cable from your home internet router and plug it into the dock, for a more reliable signal than you'd see from the Switch's own Wi-Fi connection.\nNintendo has also doubled the internal storage in the Switch OLED, from 32GB to 64GB. You also have the option of adding a microSD card if you need more room.\nBattery life remains the same as the refreshed Nintendo Switch at 4.5 to nine hours. This is better than the launch Switch's 2.5 to 6.5 hours, but the OLED Switch brings no real improvement in this area.\nHere's the interesting part. The new Nintendo Switch has an OLED screen.\nThese display panels have emissive pixels, which means black parts of the screen image will look perfectly inky black even if you play under the covers in perfect darkness.\nWith a standard Nintendo Switch, blacks end up looking slightly grey in these conditions. The OLED Switch will be much better for bed-time gaming than the old model, and should help Nintendo's already colorful artstyle stand out even more.\nIts color depth will also be much improved. The LCD Switch offers sRGB-grade color - a color standard devised in the mid-90s to standardize how things look on printers, monitors and the internet.\nAn OLED screen is likely to be able to let Nintendo widen out its color range to a wider standard like DCI P3, which is what Apple iPhones now aim for. It means bolder, deeper colors in games and a more vivid look to movies.\nThis is also the largest screen put into a Switch console yet. It measures 7 inches across, up from the 6.2 inches of the original Nintendo Switch design and the 5.5 inches of the Switch Lite.\nThere is no change in resolution. The Nintendo Switch OLED remains a 1280 x 720 pixel display. Many had hoped for a bump to 1080p (and there was even rumors of a 4K offering) in this \"next generation\" design.\nWe also have some concerns about this display panel. In March, we reported Nintendo was planning to use Samsung Display panels for a refreshed version of the Switch.\nAlmost all Samsung OLED panels use a display technology called PenTile. This is where the display pixels share sub-pixels, the tiny red, green and blue pin pricks of light that make up each color.\nPenTile panels offer reduced sharpness compared to LCD panels of the same resolution thanks to the sharing of sub-pixels, usually exhibiting as a slight fizziness to text and other high contrast objects.\nSamsung has made plenty of non-PenTile RGB OLED displays in the past. It used them in its long-discontinued OLED TVs, and in a few phones in the 2011-2012 era under the Super AMOLED Plus banner.\nSamsung's RGB OLEDs have pretty much disappeared in the intervening years. But since then its use of PenTile OLEDs has never seemed a big deal as most OLED devices these days have exceptionally high pixel density, so a slight relative loss in sharpness is largely imperceptible.\nBut the Nintendo Switch OLED really does not offer high pixel density, at 209 pixels per inch. The next Switch screen may look a little fuzzy close up then, which again, is something we'll look into at review.\nSony's original Vita OLED screen, which was later replaced with an LCD version, used an RGB sub-pixel matrix, not a PenTile one. Let's hope the OLED Switch does too.\nEither way, the new screen is also likely to be capable of significantly higher peak brightness than the ~320 nits of the standard LCD Switch. Even lower-cost OLED panels in phones today tend to reach 500-650 nits, while some are capable of searing brightness beyond 1000 nits.\nNintendo is likely to keep fairly tight control over brightness, though, as higher screen power causes greater power drain, and it is clearly keen on retaining the solid battery life of the Switch 2019 refresh. The Switch OLED comes with a light sensor to better control the display's auto-brightness setting.\nHowever, a high peak brightness OLED screen could open the door for HDR, high dynamic range, video. This is not viable in the current Switch as it doesn't have the display for it, and the original Switch\u2019s HDMI 1.4 connector is not geared-up for HDR (even if it theoretically has the bandwidth for 10-bit color at 1080p).\nDon't bet on this, though. Digging deep into techy stuff like HDR just isn't very \"Nintendo\".\nWhile the OLED screen of the new Switch will mean games look richer, bolder and more immersive than before, the console is unlikely to make any huge changes to how you play.\nNintendo has confirmed that the Switch OLED has the same Nvidia Custom Tegra processor and RAM as the current Switch, which means there is no upgrade in power under the hood.\nThat means it won't unlock any new potential for developers to bring more comprehensive games to the new console.\nWhat it does mean though, is the Switch OLED will be able to play all the same games as the Switch - and vice versa.\nIf you were hoping for a Nintendo Switch Pro with a 1080p screen and 4K output to your living room TV, the Nintendo Switch OLED announcement is sure to be a slight disappointment.\nGames will feel the same, but they should at least look prettier when playing in handheld mode. An increase in screen size with no\u00a0significant bump in the bulkiness of the console almost makes you glad the original Switch had screen borders beamed direct from 2012.\nThe Ethernet port on the dock is welcome, as is the increase in storage to 64GB. Let's just hope the new Nintendo Switch has an RGB OLED panel, because PenTile fizz at this pixel density is real, folks.\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

Das Ger\u00e4t wird es von Oktober an mit einem sieben Zoll gro\u00dfen OLED-Display f\u00fcr eine bessere Farbdarstellung geben. Auch am Geh\u00e4use wurde gearbeitet: Die Bildschirmeinfassung wird schmaler, der Aufsteller f\u00fcr den Tischmodus breiter und stufenlos verstellbar. Ein Fortschritt im Vergleich zum Vorg\u00e4ngermodell, wo der Standfu\u00df bei Belastung schnell mal aus der Fassung springt.\nDer interne Speicher wurde von 32 auf 64 Gigabyte erweitert, die integrierten Lautsprecher verbessert. Keine \u00c4nderung gibt es hingegen bei der verbauten Leistung. Die Nintendo Switch OLED setzt wie bisher auf den sechs Jahre alten Nvidia-Chip Tegra X1, Spiele laufen dadurch weder fl\u00fcssiger noch in h\u00f6herer Aufl\u00f6sung.\nAuch das neue Display stellt Spiele im Handheld-Modus maximal in einer Aufl\u00f6sung von 1.280 mal 720 Pixeln dar.

                    "value": "Nintendo announced the new Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) yesterday and plans to release it later this year. The new Nintendo console won't replace any of the existing offerings; the regular Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch Lite will still be sold next to the OLED model version of the Switch.\nYou have three models to choose from now. In this article, we will provide you with information on the models and help you make an educated decision when it comes to buying a Switch.\nThe new OLED model of the Switch is not the long awaited Switch PRO. It has the same processor and memory as the regular Switch console. As such, it does not support higher resolutions when connected to a TV or display.\nAll games and peripherals, e.g. joy-cons, work on the regular Nintendo Switch and the OLED model of the Switch. You may also place an old Switch in the new dock and an OLED model of the Switch in an old dock without experiencing any issues. Battery life and charging time are the same for both consoles.\nNintendo uses OLED technology for the Switch's own screen and has increased the size of the screen from 6.2 inches to 7 inches. The larger screen increased the size of the Switch slightly. From 9.4 inches of the regular version to 9.5 inches of the OLED version. Weight increased as well, from 0.66 lbs to 0.71 lbs.\nAnother major improvement is the OLED model's storage, as Nintendo has doubled the storage that is available in the model from the regular Switch's 32 Gigabytes to 64 Gigabytes. Both models support microSD cards to expand storage further.\nThe new Nintendo Switch model comes with improved audio speakers on the device according to Nintendo, but the audio experience is the same if you use headphones, TV speakers or other audio hardware.\nThe dock of the OLED model has a LAN port, which means that you may connect an Ethernet cable to it from your router or modem for Internet connectivity.\u00a0 The stand, available to use the Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode, has improved in the new version of the Switch.\nThe Nintendo Switch Lite is designed for handheld play. You cannot connect it to a TV screen or monitor. It has a smaller 5.5. inches screen, weights .61 lbs, and comes with a less powerful battery, which reduces battery life to 3-7 hours. The non-Lite models have larger batteries and a battery life between 4.5 and 9 hours.\nThe Switch Lite has the same hardware as the regular version. It comes with 32 Gigabytes of storage that you may expand.\nNeither.\nNintendo undoubtedly makes great games that are fun to play (although, at times, it is the 1000th iteration of the same thing). However, more often than not I feel that their hardware is cheaply made, with weak components, and that they deliberately keep it that way to also earn a surplus when selling the hardware (afaik, no other console manufacturer makes money with the hardware). I mean, the manufacturing costs of some smartphones are not higher than those of the Switch, but they still sport powerful components far above those of the Switch. The Switch has insane frame drops in some areas of Zelda \u2013 Breath of the Wild, for example. That\u2019s just shameful for a $300 console.\nAgain, no hate for the games, those are oftentimes very good, but the hardware is just a cash grab with Nintendo and has been at least since the Wii (that\u2019s when they stopped trying to put a powerful console out).\nYou cannot compare smartphones with the Switch or any other console or even PC for that matter. Most smartphones have issues when you play taxing games as they tend to warm up quickly, and then you may get reduced performance as well.\nIt is a valid approach to sell hardware without a loss. Both Microsoft and Sony subsidize their consoles, and the different strategy seems to work for Nintendo.\nAnyway, I do agree that Nintendo\u2019s focus is on games and enjoyment, and not on the latest and greatest hardware. Framerates could be better in some games.\nThey do innovate quite a bit though and release experimental games such as Nintendo Labo, Mario Kart Live Circuit or Ring Fit Adventure.\nMartin, you can solve the thermal issues with a fan (the Nintendo Switch sports a fan) and with heat dissipation across the back surface of the device. The problem is, if even the inexpensive iPhone SE is more powerful than the Switch, then we need to talk.\n\u2013 Lackluster screen resolution. \u2013 Lackluster flash memory capacity. \u2013 Lackluster RAM capacity. \u2013 Processor now weaker than the ones of most modern smartphones. \u2013 Bad battery life.\nNintendo is not a smartphone manufacturer that needs to make profit with the hardware \u2013 the Android smartphone manufacturers don\u2019t subsequently sell you apps or services, after all. Again, Nintendo doesn\u2019t need to make a profit with the hardware, yet here we are, with Nintendo selling us $120 hardware for $300, and then they still want $60 for the games. Get off my lawn, Nintendo!\nI am interested in their games, but I would only buy their hardware at a significant discount or used / mint condition. Not supporting their hardware cash grabs and their mindset of developing subpar hardware because it will be selling like cakes anyway.\nAs Martin said earlier, your comparison makes no sense. Why are you complaining that a $400 device is more powerful than a $300 device?\nThe \u201c$400 device\u201d doesn\u2019t cost $400 to manufacture. There is profit involved. Nintendo doesn\u2019t need to make profit with the hardware, in their case, $120 hardware.\nDon\u2019t get why people are acting like this is the nail in the coffin for any Switch Pro device. Nintendo always releases multiple variants of their devices.\nA Switch Pro is still a possibility, but considering the age of the Switch, it is also possible that a Switch 2 will be released by Nintendo that is backwards compatible.\nI think you\u2019re right about that.\nPeople are just annoyed because there are obvious drawbacks to the Switch that Nintendo are ignoring. i.e. the SoC is too weak to power some of it\u2019s games properly; joy-con drift; no Bluetooth audio.\nNone of the above. There are thousands of great games on PCs and older consoles already, more than anyone could play in a lifetime. $349 for another stupid portable just so you can play Mario or Zelda for the billionth time? Seriously, what a waste of money.\n100% agree.\nI bought the regular Switch last Christmas and I love it. It\u2019s the Animal Crossing edition :3 I\u2019m ok with the screen, it\u2019s a good IPS, surely my smartphone has a superior display overall, but as long as I\u2019m not looking at purely white or black screens, in colourful situations the IPS is fine as well. If I were to buy it now, ofcourse I\u2019d go for the OLED model.\nNintendo wasn\u2019t always the weakling in the console world. Two pivotal moments in Nintendo\u2019s history is the Gamecube and the Wii, both for different reasons. The Gamecube was arguably more powerful and advanced than the competition, unfortunately it wasn\u2019t enough to outpace the momentum of the likes of Sony and the new kid on the block Microsoft. Nintendo took that as a harsh lesson and leaned on that more heavily when they developed the Wii and ultimately released an under-powered cash cow. It really enforced their mindset which is very much prevalent today.\nI do feel like the Switch absolutely needed a bump up in available power but I guess if you were Nintendo and people were buying your hardware like crazy on the current set up why bother. I can\u2019t help but feel like they would make some decent gains if they increased the power even a little bit. We\u2019re talking a few fps here. At this point I don\u2019t even think the Nvidia Tegra chip is they are using is economical or worth it but that\u2019s just me.\nWhat baffles me is why Nintendo felt the need to enhance the sound and not the GPU instead. I could only imagine that it was on purpose to keep that artificial gap wide enough between this generations switch and the next one.\nThere is a point that Nintendo has to accept and that is that some more power even moderately to allow the current games they have to perform as they should or better is a quality of life improvement and not an evolution. It\u2019s as though they completely omitted one of the biggest oversights of the console not to mention the joy-cons so one would hope that the internals are different on the joy-cons because thus far they have barely changed across revisions aside from moving the wireless aerial to fix the range issues but have done absolutely nothing to address drift. I have opened and fixed several joy-cons and usually check out any new models for changes but nothing has really changed. The good thing is that parts are relatively easy to find and cheap but that does not exonerate Nintendo.\nOne of the biggest hurdle is the cost and availability of larger capacity carts. That in of itself is a huge problem regardless of what power the console has.\nI wonder why Nintendo called it a LAN port. I can connect to a LAN with a Wifi card.\nMaybe they think people are dumb and think you can only connect to LAN through cable.\nI don\u2019t understand the hype around these idiotic devices. I don\u2019t know anyone who has one. Nintendo treat their customers like garbage. I would never support Nintendo.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nGhacks is a technology news blog that was founded in 2005 by Martin Brinkmann.

                    "value": "A missed opportunity to improve docked\u00a0play.\nAfter months of pent-up expectation surrounding the 'Switch Pro' and hopes of a new, improved machine, Nintendo finally revealed its new OLED model yesterday and it is effectively a product refresh with a higher quality screen, more storage and a revised dock. No promises are being made about any actual enhancements to the performance of the machine because there are none. The same 16nm+ version of the Tegra X1 found in current Switches also beats at the heart of the OLED model, so the end result is a machine that improves the quality of the handheld experience but does not address what is arguably the Switch's biggest drawback - the quality of docked play.\nAll of which raises the question of how the Switch Pro hype train kicked off in the first place, since reputable outlets with good sources seemed to indicate that an upgraded model with a new Nvidia processor was a done deal. At Digital Foundry, we pegged the new unit as being a product refresh a few months back (see the very first DF Direct for commentary) especially as the Atmosphere custom firmware team had revealed the existence of a revised Switch with a new screen but the same core spec back in January. Apparently, the machine - internally codenamed 'Aula' - first appeared in the Switch firmware with update 10.0.0, which went public in April 2020. The only real explanation I can suggest is that development of the OLED and the actual next-gen Switch got confused at some point, birthing the Switch Pro rumour.\nIn terms of how the new Switch evolves, Nintendo's strategy is to add to the existing family of consoles. For now at least, the original model remains, as does the handheld-only 'non-Switchable' Lite. The OLED model gains a higher grade, physically larger 7-inch screen, improved audio and a multi-position kickstand, along with a light sensor on top - presumably to help with auto-brightness adjustment. Overall dimensions are much the same, but the unit is very, very slightly wider and a touch weightier. Switch OLED is confirmed to work with older docks but gets a more refined rendition with an onboard LAN port. This new dock is available for purchase separately and also works with older Switch models but there is a drawback to it - you lose the internal USB port, while the two external USB 2.0 sockets remain.\nJohn Linneman and Rich Leadbetter share their initial reactions to the Switch OLED model reveal.\nIn essence then, Switch OLED doubles down on the handheld experience that was already the strongest part of the package. The OLED screen should provide a bigger, much higher quality picture. We can confirm that there is no HDR functionality but in its comms with developers, Nintendo says that \"OLED screen colours are more vivid\". We can't judge the quality of the improved audio until we hear it, but Nintendo talks about \"an improved sound pressure level\" for the new model. The new kickstand - reminiscent of Microsoft Surface - certainly addresses a key problem from the original model, which had a stand so flimsy, it couldn't really be relied upon for stability on anything other than a rock-steady surface.\nHowever, nothing in Nintendo's marketing materials describes anything other than standard Switch performance. The size of the battery remains the same at 4310mAh, battery life is described in terms that are identical to the existing standard Switch - 4.5 hours to nine hours, depending on the application. The Verge has a statement from Nintendo clarifying that \"Nintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models.\"\nThe new machine does have more storage - 64GB of NAND compared to the original's 32GB, but beyond that, we now have complete confirmation that the internals are essentially unchanged. The same 16nm+ rendition of the Tegra X1 - codenamed 'Mariko' - is retained for the new model. In the current environment of severe semiconductor shortages, sticking with the existing silicon on what is now a relatively old production process should ensure that Nintendo can provide adequate volumes of the new machines in a world where its competitors are struggling, and make a decent profit on them too.\nIn theory, the new Switch could be overclocked to improve the fluidity of performance-challenged games - something we can test with homebrew mods to older systems.\nSo, for Nintendo and indeed game developers, the Switch OLED model is very much business as usual, to the point where the platform holder is telling game makers that no new development kits are essential for making games and there are no new technical requirements that require changing standard Switch iconography in-game to accommodate the new model. On top of that, games running on Switch OLED have no idea they are running on anything other than a standard unit - Nintendo's developer documents reveal that there is no way for their games to query the system, to figure out whether they are running on Switch OLED or not. With that said, the firm does recognise the need for developers to test their games on the new screen. With that in mind, a new ADEV development model is being made available to co-exist alongside the existing SDEV and EDEV versions. For reasons undisclosed by the Nintendo, this machine ships with 8GB of onboard memory compared to the 6GB in the other development models and the 4GB of all retail units.\nWith the Switch approaching four-and-a-half years in the market, it now seems almost certain that Nintendo will not deploy a mid-generation refresh in the mould of the DSi or the New 3DS and its offshoot models. With prior handhelds, the platform holder introduced new specs and the ability for developers to tap into extra horsepower, even if developer take-up for the extra power ended up being rather slight. That does not seem to be the case for its most modern machine. There has been disappointment that Switch OLED isn't Switch Pro - or features any performance advantages at all - and that is a shame because the longer this generation continues, the more obvious the machine's challenges as a docked home console become.\nIn one way, Nintendo's hybrid is a celebration of what's possible with a mobile chipset, one that is significantly under-clocked compared to its reference specs. We've seen feats on the 1.02GHz CPU that are extraordinary, while the GPU is relatively slow but is based on a relatively modern architecture, opening the door to many of the 'impossible ports' we've seen. Working in concert, games like Doom Eternal and The Witcher 3 have appeared running reasonably well on what is a six-year-old model chipset. However, while the machine holds up for handheld play, the docked situation looks fairly grim - with many games, sub-1080p, sub-720p and even lower resolutions just don't hold up on today's gigantic flat panels. There was much discussion of some kind of 4K upscaling for the new Switch, but it hasn't come to pass. Wired LAN port aside, there are no improvements for docked users whatsoever - and that is undoubtedly a missed opportunity.\nWhat does RT Lego Builders Journey have to do with Switch? Well, we also cover the latest enhancements to DLSS too - which could be relevant to a future Switch.\nWith a new Nvidia chip ruled out, could the existing model have provided any form of improved performance for docked users? Absolutely, but not to a genuinely game-changing degree. Overclocking (or indeed underclocking) the Switch has been a component of the homebrew scene for years now, with system hacks able to boost CPU from its standard 1.02GHz to the full spec 1785MHz, while the docked clock of 768MHz can easily be boosted to 921MHz. On paper it's a 75 percent boost to CPU performance and a 20 percent uplift for the GPU. The 'Mariko' Tegra X1 graphics core can even run at 1.267GHz - a sizeable 65 percent improvement to the Switch spec. However, despite the presence of extra venting on the new dock, it seems unlikely that Nintendo will open up full performance to developers. In theory it is possible, but there's certainly nothing in the SDK to make it happen for game makers. And in truth, based on our overclocking tests, you gain extra stability and a cleaner picture on games that support dynamic resolution scaling, so while there is an improvement, it's not enough to comprehensively solve the docked play problem.\nOf course, the truth is that only a fundamental redesign of the Switch itself can address this - something that does not really make business sense to Nintendo in the here and now, and would only cause headaches to developers in supporting a third performance profile. Any kind of smart upscaling solution capable of making truly low resolution images into something acceptable on a living room display requires new silicon, and while Nvidia DLSS has been mooted as a solution, this technology requires tensor cores baked into the hardware - and these are not present in Tegra X1. DLSS cannot work as a standalone 'add-in' chip in its current iteration, and neither can it be liberally applied to any game - it needs to be plumbed into the game engine.\nAnd both factors, combined with Nvidia's recent improvements to DLSS, make the technology a better fit for an actual Switch successor based on more recent GeForce architecture. The potential is certainly mouth-watering. DLSS performance mode runs internally at a quarter of output resolution: 720p becomes 1440p, 1080p becomes 4K. The results aren't perfect, but would certainly work well on a TV viewed at range in living room conditions. DLSS ultra performance mode can actually scale 720p to 4K. Yes, there's a quality hit, but it works. DLSS or a technology similar to it is the missing piece of the puzzle for making docked play from a mobile chipset viable, but the reality is that this is next generation stuff. So, is this the actual Switch Pro that has been talked about for months now? Would it still be a Switch Pro - or should we start referring to it as Switch 2 or Super Switch instead?\nSometimes we include links to online retail stores.

                    "value": "Nintendo on Tuesday surprised gamers by announcing a new Switch model, which will be out on October 8, right before the crucial holiday shopping season. But this isn\u2019t the rumoured Switch Pro, which many thought would come with the new Nvidia chip and the ability to support 4K TV output. Instead, the new model comes with a few extra features like a larger OLED display, a new dock which will support a wired internet connection, as well as a wide adjustable stand for use in tabletop mode. All these improvements, along with a $50 price rise seem justifiable for a hybrid console in the midst of a global pandemic. The new Switch OLED will be sold alongside the existing Switch model and Switch Lite.\nHere\u2019s every detail you need to know about the Nintendo Switch OLED model.\n7-inch OLED display: The new Switch has a larger 7-inch OLED display. Yes, as the name applies, Nintendo is adding an OLED screen that\u2019s more brighter and colorful than the 6-inch screen on the standard model. It\u2019s still a 720p resolution screen, though. The existing Switch\u2019s 6.2-inch screen looks dull, so the larger OLED display on the new model is a welcome move.\nBetter kickstand: The kickstand on the original Switch is flimsy \u2013 and yes, unreliable. With the new Switch, Nintendo has redesigned the kickstand that should improve stability. The kickstand is much wider, similar to the stand seen on the Microsoft Surface Pro. Given that a lot of people like to play games on the Switch in tabletop mode, the adjustable kickstand fixes Switch\u2019s biggest design flaws.\nDock has an integrated ethernet port: The new Switch also gets a wired ethernet via the dock. In the original Switch, there was no built-in ethernet port. If you ever wanted to use a wired network with your Switch when playing games when docked, you had no option but to use a separate USB Ethernet adapter. This might not be a big feature, but matters to a lot of people who play multiplayer games on the Switch.\nImproved speakers: Nintendo has also improved speakers on the new Switch, though we haven\u2019t tested ourselves. Enhanced audio should drastically improve the experience when playing games in handheld mode. The Switch\u2019s product page simply says, \u201cEnjoy enhanced audio from the system\u2019s onboard speakers.\u201d\nMore storage: The original Switch made its debut with 32GB of storage, and not many people complained about the internal storage. After all, Switch console\u2019s games take less storage compared to many high-profile PlayStation and Xbox games. The new Switch has twice the storage of the regular model \u2014 64GB to be exact, though that can be expanded through a memory card\n\ud83c\udfaeThe Switch OLED will be backwards compatible with all previous Switch games.\n\ud83c\udfaeThe Switch model will work with existing Switch docks.\n\ud83c\udfaeThe battery life of the OLED Switch will be the same as the standard model.\n\ud83c\udfaeThe basic form factor also remains the same.\n4K gaming: Nintendo isn\u2019t ready to jump on the 4K gaming yet, and it\u2019s clear why. Rumours suggested that one of the big highlights of the new Switch model would be improved graphics when playing games on television. 4K output would have made the Switch a lot more powerful but that required Nintendo to opt for a new chip. That didn\u2019t happen, really. The new Switch OLED, like the original Switch and Switch Lite, still plays games at 1080p on television and 720p while handheld. No support for ray tracing or new like Nvidia\u2019s DLSS either.\nNo Bluetooth audio: The Nintendo Switch doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth headphones natively, and that\u2019s a bummer for many. The new Switch doesn\u2019t seem to have added support for Bluetooth headphones. So once again you either have to use a wired 3.5mm headphones, or use an adapter to listen to your Switch wirelessly.\nOld Joy-Cons: The Switch OLED uses the same old Joy-Cons as the original Switch. Sure, Joy-Cons are innovative and bring newness to the way we play games on the Switch but they have been prone to drift problems. It\u2019s not clear why Nintendo hasn\u2019t fixed the problem, which has angered many gamers.\nThe new Switch OLED fixes the problem users had the original Switch, but it isn\u2019t the \u2018Switch Pro\u2019 we anticipated. Not to forget that Nintendo is adding a new Switch model at a time when the entire tech industry is facing chip shortages. Nintendo could have gone for a more advanced chip but that would have led to extreme shortages of the console in the market, making it hard for people to buy the new Switch during the peak Christmas shopping season. Both Sony and Microsoft have been facing the same issue ever since they started selling the PS5 and Xbox Series X last year. The demand is high for the next-generation consoles, thanks to the boom in the gaming market due to the global pandemic, but the ongoing chip shortages have made it impossible to buy the PS5 and Xbox Series X in the market.\nThere\u2019s no reason for Nintendo to add 4K visuals or include support for Nvidia\u2019s DLSS or AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Super-resolution to improve gaming performance just yet, as the Switch continues to hold the number one position in the console market.\u00a0 While this has made a lot of people disappointed, the fact is Nintendo\u2019s core belief has always been improving the gaming experience with the existing available tech rather than opting for more powerful hardware. Despite not being as powerful as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the Switch continues to sell well. Nintendo does not really need the Switch Pro, because it is not competing directly with both Sony and Microsoft anymore. Because of the console\u2019s hybrid nature and the form factor and docking station, the Switch caters to a diverse users base, making the Switch relevant for many more years. At a retail price of $350 and a robust library of first and third-party games, it is hard to beat the Switch OLED.\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Non si \u00e8 mai smesso di parlare di questo nuovo modello dell\u2019ibrida Nintendo, e dopo una serie di report, di leak e tweet da parte degli insiders, finalmente qualche istante fa abbiamo ricevuto la prima notizia ufficiale sull\u2019esistenza di questo nuovo modello di console. Ad annunciarla \u00e8 stata la stessa compagnia di Kyoto pubblicando il trailer d\u2019annuncio della nuova Nintendo Switch OLED.\nCome accade sempre pi\u00f9 spesso, l\u2019annuncio di Nintendo \u00e8 arrivato quando nessuno se lo aspettava con un trailer su YouTube. Nintendo Switch OLED riprende uno dei rumor pi\u00f9 citati sul web in questi mesi, ovvero la presenza di uno schermo leggermente pi\u00f9 ampio OLED, e lo va finalmente a confermare. A questo netto cambiamento sono state apportate alcune altre revisioni, ma niente che cambi troppo drasticamente le linee di design del modello base di Switch uscito nel 2017.\nPresente anche un nuovo stand decisamente pi\u00f9 ampio che permette a Nintendo Switch OLED di posizionarsi in 3 diverse posizioni in modalit\u00e0 portatile. Nessun aggiornamento tecnico per quanto riguarda l\u2019hardware interno della console o la Dock Station, con quest\u2019ultima che \u00e8 rimasta pressoch\u00e9 invariata a parte la presenza di una nuova porta LAN che permette la console di collegarsi in modo cablato ad una connessione internet. Identici anche i Joy-Con, che riprendono la colorazione completamente bianca dal resto della console. Infine viene annunciato che Nintendo Switch OLED uscir\u00e0 il prossimo 8 ottobre al prezzo di 349,99 Dollari.\nOra che Nintendo Switch OLED \u00e8 stata annunciata dopo mesi e mesi di continui rumor assordanti, non ci resta che attendere i prossimi mesi per scoprire ancora di pi\u00f9 sulla nuova versione della console della grande N. A tal proposito, ci aspettiamo che all\u2019interno dei prossimi mesi tale versione possa trovare sempre pi\u00f9 spazio, e magari qualche dettaglio in pi\u00f9 potrebbe essere svelato durante i prossimi Nintendo Direct.\nSe non avete ancora una console Nintendo e non vi interessa Switch Pro,\u00a0potete acquistare la console su Amazon a\u00a0questo indirizzo."

Learn more\nNintendo was supposed to announce the Nintendo Switch Pro last week \u2013 at least that\u2019s what various rumors and reports seemed to suggest. As it turned out, that wasn\u2019t the case, which ultimately begs the question: when will the Nintendo Switch Pro be revealed?\nNintendo had been tipped to show off the new Nintendo Switch before this year\u2019s E3 2021 event, which takes place on June 12 to June 15. The reason being, as reported by Bloomberg, was so that publishers and developers could freely show off their Nintendo Switch projects \u2013 many of which may have been developed with the Nintendo Switch Pro in mind.\nA reveal date was then suggested by Nick Baker, one of the hosts of the Xbox Era podcast, who believed that Nintendo\u2019s new hardware was set to be shown in all its glory on June 3. However, he did note that the date could be pushed back, which has apparently happened in the past.\nWhat made Baker\u2019s tip more believable, however, was that the rumored Switch upgrade \u2013 which will reportedly include a 7-inch 720p OLED screen and be capable of displaying at 4K resolution when hooked up to a TV \u2013 was rumored to be available for preorder on June 4 according to a prominent Pok\u00e9mon leaker. Again, this never occurred.\nAs of today, June 7, Nintendo still hasn\u2019t given any indication that a Nintendo Switch Pro reveal will take place anytime soon. It\u2019s also worth clarifying that we still have no concrete confirmation that the company is even planning a Nintendo Switch upgrade, but there are numerous reports that strongly suggest a new Switch is indeed on the way.\nTwo of the most compelling pieces of information that point to the existence of a Nintendo Switch Pro come from the OLED firm Universal Display Corp, who made mention of \"a new Switch Pro\" in an investors call. Bloomberg\u2019s most recent report was also pretty compelling, and was ratified by other industry insiders who confirmed the Switch Pro is aiming for a September to October 2021 release.\nWith E3 fast approaching, then, we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Nintendo does announce a Nintendo Switch Pro before the event takes place or not. Of course, Nintendo is holding its own conference at E3 on June 15 at 5pm BST / 9am PT / 12pm ET (or June 16 at 2am AEST), which will last for 40 minutes. The event will focus exclusively on Nintendo Switch software, with a hardware announcement not deemed to be likely.\nAdam is a Senior Gaming Writer at TechRadar.

In 2019, we got the Switch Lite, but the \u201cPro\u201d redesign was nowhere to be seen. Nintendo has finally taken the wraps off the improved Switch, and it\u2019s a bit less \u201cpro\u201d than we expected. The updated Switch has a better dock, improved audio, and a bigger OLED screen to replace the LCD of the original. It\u2019s mostly the same on the inside, though.\nIf you were hoping for 4K Nintendo gaming, you\u2019re going to have to wait for another console generation. All the rumors and speculation about AI upscaling were for naught as the Switch OLED uses the same Tegra X1 chip with support for 720p in handheld mode and 1080p in docked mode. The console doesn\u2019t even have a new name\u2014it\u2019s still just the Nintendo Switch, but they tacked on \u201cOLED model\u201d in parentheses to keep things straight. It does come with 64GB of internal storage\nThe original Switch had a 6.2-inch 720p LCD screen, and the new one steps up to a 7-inch 720p OLED panel. The increase in size without bumping the resolution could make the display look less sharp, especially if the OLED uses pen-tile subpixel arrangements like many smartphones do. The overall design of the device hasn\u2019t changed much. It still has the removable Joy-Cons, and they look unchanged. That means you should be able to use the ones you already have interchangeably with the new console. It would be nice if Nintendo fixed the drifting issues in the controllers that come with the new console, though. Please?\nUsing the OLED Switch in tabletop mode will be much less aggravating. Not only do you get better speakers on the device, but the kickstand has also evolved from a tiny piece of breakable plastic to a 2-in-1-laptop-style hinge that spans the entire back. The full-width kickstand is adjustable so you can find the most comfortable angle to play. The last notable change is not in the Switch itself but in the dock. In addition to the USB ports and HDMI, the new dock has an Ethernet port for wired connectivity.\nIf you can\u2019t wait to upgrade your Switch experience, the new console can be yours on October 8th of this year. It will retail for $350, and if recent history has taught us anything, it will probably be hard to get one for MSRP.\nSubscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.\n\u00a9 1996-2021            Ziff Davis, LLC.

                    "value": "Nintendo has finally revealed its long-rumored new model of Nintendo Switch \u2013 the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model). It will be released on October 8, and retail at $349.99 USD.\nThe upgraded machine \u2013 which many had taken to calling the 'Switch Pro' when it was being rumoured ahead of this announcement \u2013 features a larger 7-inch OLED screen (but the size of the console is unchanged from the base Switch model), a wider, adjustable base stand, enhanced audio, 64GB of internal storage, and a wired LAN port in the dock.\nContrary to previous reports, the new model doesn't appear to offer 4K TV output, or improve performance. The new OLED screen, while providing an improved picture contrast, remains a 1280x720 resolution screen. Battery life remains the same as the improved base Switch model from 2019, at an estimated 4.5-9 hours.\nUpdate: Nintendo has confirmed to The Verge that the OLED Model does not include a new CPU, or more RAM compared to previous Switch models.\nThe new model comes in two variants - the familiar red-and-blue colour combination of the original Switch (with a black dock), and one with with new white Joy-Con controllers, and a matching white dock. The new docks are mostly unchanged, aside from the LAN port and a more rounded edge. Pre-orders have not yet opened at time of writing.\nExisting Switch docks, Joy-Cons, and other accessories will remain compatible with the new OLED model. The new Switch dock is also compatible with older Switch models, including its wired LAN port.\nUpdate: Nintendo has confirmed to Digitaltrends that it will sell the new LAN port Switch dock separately as a standalone product. The company says it will be available on the Nintendo online store, but not at retail.\nThe new Switch has been timed to release on the same day as Metroid Dread, but no bundle has yet been announced. The trailer for the new model (above) shows yet-to-be released games like Metroid Dread, the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild sequel, and Splatoon 3, but all footage appears to be pre-existing.\nDespite saying that it was focusing on existing Switch models, and saying it wouldn't announce a new model 'anytime soon' in February, reports continuously emerged about a new model of the hybrid console. We'd previously heard that the upgraded model would come with a larger screen and 4K output, and that it would offer improved graphics, support Nvidia DLSS, and would come in at a higher price point. It remains to be seen whether another new model is on the way.\nNintendo had a record-breaking year in 2020, driven by huge sales of Switch and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and is reportedly expecting to break that record again this year. That could be in part to do with the release of a new Switch, and getting existing owners to upgrade. The only impediment might be the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which currently means Nintendo can't physically make enough Switch consoles."

Learn more\nWhen Nintendo announced the new Switch OLED model earlier this week, fans were a little baffled. Many were expecting the much-rumoured \"Pro\" model with vastly improved specs, but instead we got basically the same thing, albeit with a brighter display. But perhaps even stranger than the new console is one hilarious detail from Nintendo's reveal video.\nNaturally, the ad shows various beautiful people enjoying the Switch in all manner of aspirational settings (beside pools, in stunning kitchens, you get the idea). And then there's the man who decides to play Pokemon on a wooden bench in his hallway. If you don't fancy the couch, at least try one of the best office chairs, mate.\nNow, we're not ones to judge anyone's gaming habits. But we are going to judge this man's. Is there nowhere else to play in his house? No seat more comfortable? No position less... angular? Does he have a living room? Is he allowed in there? If not, why not? What did he do? What was his crime?\nOf course, Twitter is (as Twitter does) making its feelings known about Hallway Man. The scene has been branded 'absurd', 'bizarre' and every other synonym for 'downright weird' you can think of:\nObsessed with this man from the new Switch trailer. He gets home from work, sits down on the weird decorative bench in the front hallway of his Very Nice House, and is immediately on his Pokemon grind.This whole sequence is so surreal in, like, a cheery uncanny valley way. pic.twitter.com/P9MZI2DKP4July 6, 2021\nThe most absurd scenario in the Nintendo Switch OLED trailer was when a man walks into his home and just decides that the hallway is the best place for him to play Pokemon pic.twitter.com/Wbb8cV20zSJuly 6, 2021\nOne thing's for sure: this is a man who clearly isn't disappointed with the Nintendo Switch OLED Model. Unfortunately, there are plenty who are \u2013 from 4K output to a new chip, there are tons of rumoured \"Pro\" features that failed to make their way to the new Switch. But hey, we got a new plastic kickstand, so, swings and roundabouts.\nIf a brighter OLED display doesn't matter too much to you, rather than waiting until October, we'd recommend checking out the best Nintendo Switch deals available right now.

                    "value": "Nintendo's new Switch OLED Model arrives this October, and brings with it a massively improved screen which is brighter, offers more convincing contrast and is larger in size, coming in at 7-inches corner-to-corner (the original Switch has a screen size of 6.2-inches while the Switch Lite has a screen of 5.5 inches).\nThe Switch OLED also brings with it enhanced audio thanks to superior speakers and a handy, Microsoft Surface-style kickstand which has several angle settings and looks to be a lot more robust than the one on the original Switch. With all of those improvements \u2013 which sadly stop short of a new CPU and RAM \u2013 you might assume that the Switch OLED Model has a better battery, too, but that's sadly not the case. It has the same 4310mAh Lithium-ion power cell that's seen in the original Switch model.\nOrdinarily, including a larger screen would mean weaker battery life over the original model, because the battery is having to power a larger surface area. However, because the Switch OLED uses an OLED screen rather than an LCD one, it's actually using less power \u2013 so the theory goes that the increased screen size is balanced out by the less-hungry display technology.\nThis is presumably why Nintendo has listed the exact same approximate battery life for the OLED Model as the 2019 'XKW' version: 4.5 to 9 hours, depending on the game being played. The 2017 launch model \u2013 denoted by its serial number starting with 'XAW' \u2013 is only good for around 2.5 to 6.5 hours of gameplay on a single charge.\nDamien has over a decade of professional writing experience under his belt, as well as a repulsively hairy belly. Rumours that he turned down a role in The Hobbit to work on Nintendo Life are, to the best of our knowledge, completely and utterly unfounded.\nTrash revision.\nGood battery upgrade, though.\nTRASH update...same hours as previous v2 nothing improved other then Scalping your money. NO Upgrade for the GPU with same battery is just pure Trash.\n@SwitchForce Nah, this was supposed to be the first, battery-efficient Model.It was supposed to have the OLED,but due to COVID, OLED screens were delayed & raised in price.However, Nvidia still planned on discontinuing the original TEGRA.Thus Nintendo gave us a battery-efficient Model without OLED.\nHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...\nController updates arrive with Version 12.1.0\nNintendo Switch OLED Model Vs.

The \"OLED\u00a0Model\" as Nintendo is calling it, will be available October 8 for an MSRP of $349.99.\nThe OLED\u00a0Model also expands the Switch's screen to 7\", up from the 6.2\" of the original Switch and 5.5\" of the Switch Lite. This is accomplished without substantially increasing the size of the standard Switch unit itself; the OLED Model is just 0.1\" wider than the original Switch, with the same height and depth. The increase in screen real estate is thanks to a reduction in the space used for the black bezel around the tablet screen.\nThose that use the Switch in \"tabletop mode\" will be happy to hear that the Switch's incredibly flimsy kickstand has been replaced in the OLED\u00a0Model with a wide adjustable stand that extends across the entire width of the system. This new built-in stand also lets players \"freely tilt the system\" to ensure the perfect viewing angle.\nNintendo says the new hardware unit will be available in two configurations: one with two white Joy-cons (and a white dock) and one with red and blue Joy-Cons and a black dock. The new system will be fully compatible with all existing Joy-Cons, Switch accessories, and games as well.\nA quick comparison table posted by Nintendo confirm the OLED Model will have the same 4.5 to 9 hours of battery life as Switch models available since late 2019. The new unit will also weight about 0.93 lbs with Joy-Cons attached, up slightly from the 0.88 lbs of the original Switch.\nYou must login or create an account to comment.\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox."

Cuenta con una reproducci\u00f3n de color mejorada y un nivel de contraste muy superior al de la versi\u00f3n anterior, adem\u00e1s de unos m\u00e1rgenes de pantalla que han reducido su tama\u00f1o notablemente con respecto a la edici\u00f3n anterior. No obstante, se mantiene la misma resoluci\u00f3n 720p del modelo lanzado hace ya varios a\u00f1os.Por todo lo dem\u00e1s, la Switch OLED no es muy diferente de la Switch original en cuanto a su est\u00e9tica, salvo por la diferencia de que este nuevo modelo est\u00e1 disponible en color blanco.Una pantalla OLED de 7 pulgadas ocupa el frontal de la Nintendo Switch OLED.Otras novedades son la inclusi\u00f3n de un puerto Ethernet en el dock, o un soporte ajustable que permite colocar la consola en la mejor posici\u00f3n posible a la hora de jugar.Esta Switch OLED cuenta con 64 GB de almacenamiento interno, un sistema de altavoces mejorado y los cl\u00e1sicos Joy-Con, esta vez en color blanco.

Learn more\nBowser has his say.\nAh, the Nintendo Switch Pro. We've been hearing rumours about the Switch's supposed successor for what feels like a century \u2013 but you don't need us to tell you that the console didn't appear at this month's E3 conference as many were expecting.\nNintendo has been characteristically tight-lipped about the Switch Pro \u2013 until now. \u00a0The company's president, Doug Bowser (yes, his name is Bowser) was recently asked about the Switch Pro no-show, and gave us some insight into Nintendo's plans. (Check out the best Prime Day Nintendo Switch deals if you want to start gaming right here and now.)\n\"We are always looking at technology and how technology can enhance gameplay experiences. It\u2019s not technology for technology\u2019s sake,\u201d Bowser told The Washington Post. \"And then where do you apply that technology? Do you want to apply it on current existing hardware or platforms, or do you want to wait for the next platform? And then what\u2019s the right gameplay experience with that? There\u2019s a host of factors that goes into it, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re always looking at.\"\nOkay, so it's rather evasive answer \u2013 but it does suggest that Nintendo isn't planning to rush into releasing new tech for the sake of it. But then again, the company is \"always looking at\" new tech \u2013 so a souped-up Switch could well be on the horizon. The question is: when? With the PS5 and Xbox Series X raising the gaming stakes, we'd say now is a good time, Mr. Bowser. Right now.\nAccording to leaks, the Switch Pro will mark a significant improvement on the original Switch. Not only will it feature a larger, brighter screen, but it's also set for massively enhanced internals. Bloomberg has claimed the Switch Pro will feature a 7-inch display (as opposed to the current model's 6.2-inches). What's more, it will do away with LCD technology in favour of an OLED screen \u2013 making it much brighter and crisper.\nThe report also suggested that the new Switch will support 4K output when connected to a TV. While the Switch currently supports 1080p output while docked (or 720p in handheld mode), 4K video would be a new frontier for Nintendo. Exploring Breath of the Wild's Hyrule or zooming around Bowser's castle in Mario Kart will be more immersive experiences than ever in crisp 4K.\nAs for what the Super Nintendo Switch will look like, we'll have to wait and see. But if it's anything like this incredible 'Switch Pro' concept, fans will no doubt be pleased. Demonstrating what a larger display might look like, the design (above) features a huge, 4K screen and much more ergonomic-looking Joy Cons.\nIndeed, the Switch Pro can't arrive soon enough. That said, the current Switch is showing no signs of slowing down. And with today being Amazon Prime Day, there are some super-rare discounts to be found on the willy popular device:\nIf these deals don't take your fancy, or they aren't available in your area, check out more great Nintendo Switch deals below.\nThank you for signing up to Creative Bloq.

Apr\u00c3\u00a8s la version normale et la d\u00c3\u00a9clinaison Lite, il faudra faire place \u00c3\u00a0 l\u00e2\u0080\u0099it\u00c3\u00a9ration OLED. Alors que beaucoup s\u00e2\u0080\u0099attendaient \u00c3\u00a0 une Switch Pro, la firme nippone lance finalement une console juste l\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a8rement am\u00c3\u00a9lior\u00c3\u00a9e. Elle n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est pas plus puissante mais s\u00e2\u0080\u0099appuie sur des options de confort en plus (exemple\u00c2\u00a0: un meilleur \u00c3\u00a9cran).\nLa Switch OLED sera disponible \u00c3\u00a0 partir du 8 octobre, au prix de 349,99 \u00e2\u0082\u00ac selon l\u00e2\u0080\u0099enseigne Micromania. En attendant le lancement, on fait le point sur les diff\u00c3\u00a9rences avec la Switch normale, qui constitue d\u00c3\u00a9sormais le c\u00c5\u0093ur\u00c2\u00a0de gamme. On exclut volontairement la Switch Lite, qui ne vise pas du tout la m\u00c3\u00aame cible.\nDe loin, rien ne semble distinguer la Switch de la Switch OLED, \u00c3\u00a0 part sa couleur blanche. On a affaire \u00c3\u00a0 un design similaire, avec des mensurations similaires (le poids est l\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a8rement diff\u00c3\u00a9rent). En sch\u00c3\u00a9matisant au maximum, il s\u00e2\u0080\u0099agit toujours d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une tablette \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9ment principal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sur laquelle viennent se greffer des petites manettes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 les Joy-Con, qui n\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a9voluent pas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 de chaque c\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9. Sur la face avant, on remarque que Nintendo est parvenu \u00c3\u00a0 rogner les bords pour offrir un \u00c3\u00a9cran un peu plus grand\u00c2\u00a0: 7 pouces (17,8 cm) contre 6,2 (15,7 cm). Pour le confort visuel, c\u00e2\u0080\u0099est un vrai plus, \u00c2\u00a0d\u00e2\u0080\u0099autant qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099on passe d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une dalle LCD \u00c3\u00a0 un panneau OLED.\nComme la Switch normale, la Switch OLED peut \u00c3\u00aatre utilis\u00c3\u00a9e en mode table. Mais, contrairement \u00c3\u00a0 la Switch Normale, elle ne tiendra pas debout gr\u00c3\u00a2ce \u00c3\u00a0 une b\u00c3\u00a9quille trop fragile. Pour sa future console, Nintendo a opt\u00c3\u00a9 pour un large support ajustable proposant\u00c2\u00a0plusieurs angles d\u00e2\u0080\u0099inclinaison (\u00c3\u00a0 l\u00e2\u0080\u0099instar des produits hybrides Surface de Microsoft). Sur les photos officielles, on remarque que cette caract\u00c3\u00a9ristique a forc\u00c3\u00a9 Nintendo a revoir la position du logo\u00c2\u00a0: il est plus bas et moins gros. Sinon, on retrouve la m\u00c3\u00aame disposition des touches, pour une exp\u00c3\u00a9rience de jeu identique dans les grandes lignes.\nAu niveau des coloris, on reste sur deux choix au niveau des Joy-Con (la tablette reste grise fonc\u00c3\u00a9e dans les deux cas)\u00c2\u00a0: gris ou bleu n\u00c3\u00a9on/rouge n\u00c3\u00a9on pour la Switch et blanc ou bleu n\u00c3\u00a9on/rouge n\u00c3\u00a9on pour la Switch OLED.\nDu c\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9 des fonctionnalit\u00c3\u00a9s principales, la Switch OLED ne fera rien de plus ni de moins que la Switch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contrairement \u00c3\u00a0 la Switch Lite qui ne propose qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099un seul mode d\u00e2\u0080\u0099utilisation (portable).\nGr\u00c3\u00a2ce \u00c3\u00a0 son \u00c3\u00a9cran OLED et ses haut-parleurs cens\u00c3\u00a9s \u00c3\u00aatre am\u00c3\u00a9lior\u00c3\u00a9s, elle offrira un peu plus de confort de jeu en mode portable. Celles et ceux qui ne jouent qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099en mode salon ne trouveront aucun int\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00aat \u00c3\u00a0 cette Switch OLED, qui n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est pas plus puissante que les deux autres mod\u00c3\u00a8les de la gamme. Elle int\u00c3\u00a8gre le m\u00c3\u00aame processeur et la m\u00c3\u00aame quantit\u00c3\u00a9 de m\u00c3\u00a9moire vive.\nLa Switch OLED s\u00e2\u0080\u0099appuiera sur le m\u00c3\u00aame catalogue que la Switch, avec une compatibilit\u00c3\u00a9 assur\u00c3\u00a9e pour tous les jeux actuels (et ceux \u00c3\u00a0 venir). On notera que le dock qui est fourni int\u00c3\u00a8gre un port Ethernet pour le brancher directement \u00c3\u00a0 son modem internet. Petite pr\u00c3\u00a9cision\u00c2\u00a0: la Switch OLED est compatible avec l\u00e2\u0080\u0099ancien dock, tout comme l\u00e2\u0080\u0099ancienne Switch l\u00e2\u0080\u0099est avec le nouveau.\nOn retrouve par ailleurs les fonctionnalit\u00c3\u00a9s suivantes\u00c2\u00a0: vibrations HD, cam\u00c3\u00a9ra IR, acc\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9rom\u00c3\u00a8tre, gyroscope, capteur de luminosit\u00c3\u00a9 et port jack. La capacit\u00c3\u00a9 de stockage est doubl\u00c3\u00a9e par rapport \u00c3\u00a0 la Switch et \u00c3\u00a0 la Switch Lite\u00c2\u00a0: on passe de 32 \u00c3\u00a0 64 Go, un espace qui peut \u00c3\u00aatre \u00c3\u00a9tendu gr\u00c3\u00a2ce au port microSD.\nOn termine par l\u00e2\u0080\u0099autonomie\u00c2\u00a0: Nintendo annonce entre 4h30 et 9h d\u00e2\u0080\u0099autonomie, car la dur\u00c3\u00a9e varie beaucoup en fonction des jeux. Avec un ambitieux The Legend of Zelda\u00c2\u00a0: Breath of the Wild, la Switch OLED peut tenir 5h30 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 soit la m\u00c3\u00aame autonomie que la Switch normale.\nAujourd\u00e2\u0080\u0099hui, on trouve la Switch normale aux alentours des 299 \u00e2\u0082\u00ac. De son c\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00a9, la Switch OLED sera propos\u00c3\u00a9e \u00c3\u00a0 349,99 \u00e2\u0082\u00ac. On peut d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 la pr\u00c3\u00a9commander.\nSi le savoir peut cr\u00c3\u00a9er des probl\u00c3\u00a8mes, ce n'est pas l'ignorance qui les r\u00c3\u00a9soudra."

                    "value": "Nach mehreren Absagen durch Nintendo kommt sie jetzt also doch: eine verbesserte Switch \u2013 mit 7-Zoll-OLED-Panel wohlgemerkt und nicht mit mehr Leistung, wie zuvor noch spekuliert wurde. 4K und DLSS waren jedoch mangels passender Nvidia-Chips Wunschdenken. Die Switch OLED ist vor allem eine bessere mobile Spielkonsole.\nDie zuvor spekulierte Switch Pro mit aufgebohrter Hardware, 4K-Bildausgabe und DLSS-Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr KI-gest\u00fctztes Upscaling auf h\u00f6here Aufl\u00f6sungen ist mit der gestrigen Ank\u00fcndigung der Switch OLED vorerst Geschichte. Dass Nintendo in den kommenden Jahren eine st\u00e4rkere \u201eSwitch 2\u201c vorstellen wird, ist nicht auszuschlie\u00dfen, im Hier und Jetzt ist aber erst einmal nur die Switch OLED Realit\u00e4t. Mehr Leistung f\u00fcr die Switch scheinen sich viele Anwender erhofft zu haben, wie die eher verhaltenen Reaktionen auf das neue Modell unter anderem im Forum von ComputerBase erkennen lassen.\nRealistisch gesehen war eine \u201eSwitch Pro\u201c mit 4K und DLSS aber eher Wunschdenken. Es gibt bislang nicht einmal einen passenden Tegra-Chip von Nvidia, der DLSS ausf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnte. Die Shield nutzt (seit dem 2019er Upgrade) den aufgebohrten Tegra X1+ (\u201eMariko\u201c) mit Maxwell-GPU, die mit DLSS nichts anzufangen wei\u00df. Zwar werden Tensor-Cores nicht zwangsweise f\u00fcr DLSS vorausgesetzt, Nvidia bietet das Upscaling aber erst seit den deutlich st\u00e4rkeren RTX-2000-Grafikkarten mit Turing an. Und seit DLSS 2.0 kommen die Tensor-Cores zum Einsatz, die es im Tegra-Umfeld nicht oder zumindest nicht in f\u00fcr die Switch geeigneten Chips gibt.\nMit Volta gab es erstmals Tensor-Cores, eine solche GPU findet sich aber fr\u00fchestens im Nvidia Xavier, der bislang vor allem in Bereichen wie Automotive und Robotik genutzt wird. Consumer-Produkte mit Xavier-SoC gibt es nicht am Markt. Aber: In den kleineren NX-Konfigurationen mit 10 und 15\u00a0Watt lie\u00dfe sich der Chip potenziell in einer neuen Switch unterbringen. Neuere Nvidia-SoCs wie Orin mit Ampere- oder Atlan mit Ampere-Next-GPU sind in ihren vorgestellten Konfigurationen f\u00fcr das Automotive-Segment \u00fcberdimensioniert und v\u00f6llig ungeeignet f\u00fcr eine mobile Spielkonsole wie die Switch, bei der Nintendo immer auch noch akzeptable Akkulaufzeiten im Auge behalten muss.\nIm station\u00e4ren Betrieb im Dock bringt die neue Switch keinerlei Vorteile gegen\u00fcber der bisherigen mit, die Nintendo weiterhin anbietet \u2013 LAN-Anschluss ausgenommen. Die maximale Aufl\u00f6sung bleibt in diesem Modus bei 1080p60. Nvidias eigene Shield mit dem gleichen Tegra X1+ beherrscht immerhin die Bildausgabe in 2160p60 und KI-Upscaling f\u00fcr Filme und Serien.\nDie Switch OLED ist deshalb vor allem eine bessere mobile Spielkonsole. Das gr\u00f6\u00dfere OLED-Display d\u00fcrfte bei Farben und Kontrast deutlich bessere Werte liefern, hoffentlich liegt auch die Helligkeit auf hohem Niveau. Und der neue Kickstand auf der R\u00fcckseite, der ein wenig an die Surface-Ger\u00e4te von Microsoft erinnert, gibt dem Spieler deutlich mehr Freiheiten beim Aufstellen der Konsole und bei der Wahl des Blickwinkels im Auto, Flieger, Zug oder einfach nur auf dem Tisch. Die fummelige Konstruktion des bisherigen Kickstands war von Anfang an ein \u00c4rgernis und ist mit dem neuen Modell endlich Geschichte.\nHinweis: Der Inhalt dieses Kommentars gibt die pers\u00f6nliche Meinung des Autors wieder.

Il trailer promozionale ha mostrato una console di colore bianco, ma dai primi pre-ordini disponibili su GameStop\u00a0e dai comunicati stampa \u00e8 emersa\u00a0anche una versione nera con Joy-Con neon.\nMentre il mondo dei videogiochi attendeva un annuncio sulla fantomatica Switch Pro, una ipotetica console ibrida Nintendo in grado di avere prestazioni hardware pi\u00f9 performanti, la casa di Kyoto ha sorpreso tutti con una versione aggiornata della console del 2017. In realt\u00e0 si tratta di uno stile di marketing che da tempo contraddistingue l\u2019azienda, basti pensare a tutte le versioni di Nintendo DS e 3DS pubblicate negli scorsi anni.\nNel fare compagnia alla versione base e alla Switch Lite, la nuova console OLED offre semplicemente un design pi\u00f9 elegante e funzionale, senza migliorarne davvero le prestazioni. A conti fatti si tratta di una versione aggiornata che far\u00e0 comodo esclusivamente a chi non ha ancora acquistato una Nintendo Switch. Al di l\u00e0 della colorazione bianca, i bordi sono pi\u00f9 arrotondati, il display dovrebbe essere in grado di fornire pi\u00f9 resistenza e immersivit\u00e0, il supporto alla modalit\u00e0 tabletop offre pi\u00f9 soluzioni regolabili, ed \u00e8 presente \u2013 finalmente \u2013 anche una porta LAN sul dock.\nDai pre-ordini e dai comunicati stampa che sono spuntati in giro nelle ore successive all\u2019annuncio \u00e8 apparsa anche una versione con docking station nera standard e Joy-Con colorati del tipico rosso e blu di Nintendo Switch. Tale versione \u00e8 chiamata\u00a0Nintendo Switch OLED \u2013 Color Neon. Entrambe le versioni della nuova console hanno un prezzo di circa 350\u20ac e saranno rilasciate l\u20198 ottobre 2011, in contemporanea con Metroid Dread.\nPotete pre-ordinare Metroid Dread, giocabile anche su una Nintendo Switch modello base o Lite, seguendo questo link."

                    "value": "We are just a few hours away from the Nintendo E3 Direct, which the company has said will only be focused on software. The fact that we\u2019ve arrived at this point negates a theory that Nintendo was going to debut its upgraded Nintendo Switch Pro, said to have 4K docked capabilities and a new OLED 4K screen, before E3 so it and its partners should showcase games using the new tech.\nBut that hasn\u2019t happened. And unless Nintendo is just plain lying about today\u2019s Direct being software-only, we\u2019re not about to get an announcement during the show today either.\nMy theory is that while the Switch Pro does exist, that perhaps Nintendo has decided to push its arrival until 2022 instead of this holiday, given that both A) the current Switch is selling incredibly well and B) a global component shortage makes the idea of launching a brand new console in the next few months seem like a not great idea.\nBut this idea runs contrary to a recent Bloomberg report that said that Nintendo is spooling up production and could debut the Switch Pro as soon as September. And when I asked Bloomberg\u2019s Jason Schreier if he still thought that was happen, he said he stands by the reporting of his colleagues (he didn\u2019t write the original piece).\nOne aspect of that piece has already not panned out, however, as the article said it seemed likely that Nintendo would announce the Switch Pro ahead of E3, where unless that happens in the next (checks watch) three and a half hours, that\u2019s not going to be the case.\nI also don\u2019t really understand why if they were planning a Switch Pro release in September or October 2021 like the article says, why they wouldn\u2019t be at least announcing the new model now, at the world\u2019s largest video game show where they are presumably about to show off a bunch of games that should be running on this new hardware. We already saw a new Mario + Rabbits game from Ubisoft that looked suspiciously good, and I expect to see more of that kind of thing today.\nI supposed it\u2019s possible Nintendo was using subterfuge and plans to announce the Pro today, but if not then, perhaps in some other Direct in a month or so. Again, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense why they wouldn\u2019t use the platform of E3 to announce the Pro, if its release date really is so close, so who knows what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. But I am also prone to trust Schreier and the reliable Bloomberg team\u2019s reporting.\nI don\u2019t actually expect to have any answers by the end of the day here, as Nintendo will likely stick to what they said and only show games today. But after that, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what happens next with the Switch Pro and its reveal.\nFollow me\u00a0on Twitter,\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nSubscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter,\u00a0God Rolls.\nPick up my sci-fi novels the\u00a0Herokiller series, and\u00a0The Earthborn Trilogy, which is also on\u00a0audiobook.\nI\u2019ve been writing about video games, television and movies for Forbes for over 10 years, and you may have seen my reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.

Por fin, la compa\u00f1\u00eda japonesa ha presentado una nueva Switch, pero no es la que algunos esperaban.\nSu nombre es Nintendo Switch (modelo OLED), y como bien lo indica, su mayor cambio se encuentra en la pantalla. Se trata de un modelo que sirve como actualizaci\u00f3n de la Switch est\u00e1ndar, pero sin cambiar mucho. De hecho, su mayor es un incremento en el tama\u00f1o del panel, el cual ahora es de 7 pulgadas (el modelo original ten\u00eda 6,2\") y un cambio en la tecnolog\u00eda de la pantalla, que ahora cuenta con un panel OLED, en lugar del panel LCD de los anteriores modelos de la Switch.\nEsta pantalla OLED cuenta con una resoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de 1920x1080 p\u00edxeles y 60fps cuando est\u00e1 conectada al dock para usarse con un televisor o pantalla externa, seg\u00fan la web oficial de Nintendo. En el caso del modo port\u00e1til, la resoluci\u00f3n contin\u00faa siendo de 1280x720 p\u00edxeles, igual que en modelos anteriores. Los bordes alrededor de la pantalla son un poco m\u00e1s delgados en comparaci\u00f3n a la anterior Switch.\nEsto significa que la nueva Switch no es ese modelo 4K del que hablaban los rumores, los cuales eran justamente eso, rumores que la compa\u00f1\u00eda en ning\u00fan momento confirm\u00f3. No obstante, el cambio por un panel OLED ofrece un mayor brillo en la pantalla que mejorar\u00e1, en teor\u00eda, la experiencia de uso de la consola en modo port\u00e1til, algo que claramente le importa mucho a Nintendo y parece ser su enfoque principal con esta actualizaci\u00f3n.\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda confirm\u00f3 a Verge que la nueva consola no cuenta con un nuevo procesador o mas memoria RAM, lo que significa que no tiene mejoras notables de rendimiento o gr\u00e1ficos. Los JoyCons tampoco han cambiado, seg\u00fan declaraciones de Nintendo a Polygon. De resto, la nueva Switch OLED incluye 64 GB de almacenamiento, un puerto para conexi\u00f3n a internet (Ethernet) en el dock y mejoras de audio en sus altavoces, seg\u00fan el anuncio. Su bater\u00eda continuar\u00e1 teniendo la misma autonom\u00eda, de entre 4 y 9 horas, dependiendo del juego al que est\u00e9s jugando.\nLa nueva Switch OLED saldr\u00e1 a la venta el pr\u00f3ximo 8 de octubre por un precio de 350 d\u00f3lares, lo que supone un peque\u00f1o incremento de precio (50 d\u00f3lares) en comparaci\u00f3n a su modelo anterior.\nRedactor en Gizmodo.

It'll be available on Oct. 8 -- the day Metroid Dread comes out -- and will cost $350, or $50 more than the original. As of Wednesday morning, Best Buy and GameSpot had product pages for the new Switch, but you can't preorder just yet.\nUK retailer Game has it up for preorder at \u00a3310, while Australia's EB Games has it for $539, but Nintendo hasn't announced official prices for those countries.\nThe 7-inch screen is slightly bigger than the regular Switch model's 6.2- and the\u00a0Switch Lite's 5.5-inch LCD screens, but the new model's organic light-emitting diode display will offer more vivid colors and crisp contrast. It also features a wide adjustable stand (compared to the original model's flimsy kickstand), a new dock with a wired LAN port, 64 gigabytes of internal storage and \"enhanced audio for handheld and tabletop play.\"\nIt offers the same 4.5- to 9-hour battery life as the regular Switch (the Lite lasts 3 to 7 hours), and uses the same Nvidia Custom Tegra processor.

Il ne sera pas plus puissant, contrairement \u00c3\u00a0 ce que les rumeurs insistantes \u00c3\u00a0 son sujet laissaient pr\u00c3\u00a9sager.\nCe mardi 6 juillet, Nintendo a pris tout le monde de court. Et plut\u00c3\u00b4t deux fois qu\u00e2\u0080\u0099une\u00c2\u00a0: non seulement il a officialis\u00c3\u00a9 une nouvelle Switch sans pr\u00c3\u00a9sentation en grande pompe (un communiqu\u00c3\u00a9, un simple tweet et une courte vid\u00c3\u00a9o YouTube ont suffi) mais, en prime, cette Switch n\u00e2\u0080\u0099a rien d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un mod\u00c3\u00a8le Pro.

Tout comme elle ne proposera pas la technologie DLSS de Nvidia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 un tour de passe-passe permettant d\u00e2\u0080\u0099am\u00c3\u00a9liorer les graphismes.\nSi elle n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est pas plus puissante, la Switch OLED apportera quand m\u00c3\u00aame plusieurs options de confort appr\u00c3\u00a9ciables, davantage pens\u00c3\u00a9es pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099usage mobile. Au centre des nouveaut\u00c3\u00a9s se trouve cet \u00c3\u00a9cran OLED d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une diagonale de 7 pouces (soit un peu plus que la Switch actuelle). Mais d\u00e2\u0080\u0099autres ajouts viendront combler celles et ceux qui adorent jouer en mode nomade, dans le sillage des meilleurs haut-parleurs et de cette b\u00c3\u00a9quille retravaill\u00c3\u00a9e (qui n\u00e2\u0080\u0099est plus tout \u00c3\u00a0 fait une b\u00c3\u00a9quille).\nNintendo estime que sa gamme Switch n\u00e2\u0080\u0099a pas besoin d\u00e2\u0080\u0099une r\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a9rence dot\u00c3\u00a9e d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un meilleur processeur, sans doute par peur de semer le trouble dans l\u00e2\u0080\u0099esprit des utilisateurs. Cela permet de balayer une crainte\u00c2\u00a0: avec une Switch plus puissante, il y a ce risque de voir arriver des jeux trop gourmands pour les versions existantes. Cette d\u00c3\u00a9clinaison OLED fera tourner The Legend of Zelda\u00c2\u00a0: Breath of the Wild 2, au m\u00c3\u00aame titre que la Switch normale et que la Switch Lite. Et elle n\u00e2\u0080\u0099offrira pas de meilleurs graphismes ou des performances \u00c3\u00a0 la hausse. Au sein de la communaut\u00c3\u00a9 Switch, il n\u00e2\u0080\u0099y aura donc pas de scission et le futur catalogue n\u00e2\u0080\u0099exclura personne (\u00c3\u00a0 quelques exceptions pr\u00c3\u00a8s pour la Switch Lite).\nPar cons\u00c3\u00a9quent, la Switch OLED s\u00e2\u0080\u0099adresse \u00c3\u00a0 celles et ceux qui souhaitent une exp\u00c3\u00a9rience de jeu am\u00c3\u00a9lior\u00c3\u00a9e, mais pas fonci\u00c3\u00a8rement diff\u00c3\u00a9rente. La technologie OLED permet d\u00e2\u0080\u0099afficher de plus belles couleurs et des noirs plus profonds, tandis que les quelques centim\u00c3\u00a8tres de diagonale d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a9cran suppl\u00c3\u00a9mentaires (7 pouces contre 6,2) apportent un surplus de confort pour les yeux. Nintendo met \u00c3\u00a9galement en avant des haut-parleurs offrant un son de meilleure facture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 une mani\u00c3\u00a8re de se rapprocher (mais pas d\u00e2\u0080\u0099atteindre) la qualit\u00c3\u00a9 propos\u00c3\u00a9e par les autres consoles, gr\u00c3\u00a2ce au rendu audio 3D encore plus immersif. En termes d\u00e2\u0080\u0099autonomie, la Switch OLED ne fera pas mieux que la Switch (deuxi\u00c3\u00a8me g\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9ration)\u00c2\u00a0: comptez 5h30 de balade dans The Legend of Zelda\u00c2\u00a0: Breath of the Wild.\nEn plus de ces l\u00c3\u00a9gers changements d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ordre technique (meilleur son et meilleur affichage), la Switch OLED troque la fragile b\u00c3\u00a9quille de la Switch (quasi inutilisable) pour un large support ajustable. Il\u00c2\u00a0couvre quasiment tout le dos de la console (tant mieux pour la solidit\u00c3\u00a9) et offre divers angles d\u00e2\u0080\u0099inclinaison.

La capacit\u00c3\u00a9 de stockage interne passe \u00c3\u00a0 64 Go (contre 32 pour la Switch et la Switch Lite), ce qui permettra d\u00e2\u0080\u0099installer plus de jeux sans besoin d\u00e2\u0080\u0099investir dans une carte microSD additionnelle. En outre, pour l\u00e2\u0080\u0099usage salon, le dock est d\u00c3\u00a9sormais \u00c3\u00a9quip\u00c3\u00a9 d\u00e2\u0080\u0099un port Ethernet, pour une connexion internet plus stable lors des parties en ligne.

                    "value": "Well, after all that talk about the Nintendo Switch getting new hardware, we have our answer. And it\u2019s\u2026somewhat confusing.\nThis morning, Nintendo has revealed the new OLED Switch, which confirms rumors that Nintendo was working on an upgraded version of the handheld screen with a better display and slightly bigger size.\nBut for all the talk about the \u201cSwitch Pro,\u201d that OLED screen seems to be\u2026more or less the most major upgrade for the new system, which is priced at $350 and will release on October 8.\nThe other additions the new hardware has besides the screen is improved sound from the handheld unit and a wired LAN port for the base. It also has an adjustable stand and 64 GB of internal storage. But for those who were hoping that this would be a power upgrade for the current Switch, which is now over four years old, that does not seem to be the case. There\u2019s nothing at all listed about changes to the internal hardware of the Switch. The main draw is simply the screen, and unless Nintendo is hiding any performance upgrades, there\u2026do not appear to be any.\nThe Nintendo Switch, of course, has not suffered from its lack of power compared to other consoles to date, so it may feel less pressure to upgrade itself in that way the way we see with other mid-gen hardware refreshes like the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X previously. But to have the main draw be a slightly better screen is a bit odd, and I\u2019m not even sure if the actual resolution is improving past 720p. There\u2019s nothing in any of the promotional materials about the screen\u2019s resolution being enhanced, only that it\u2019s now OLED tech. And rumors about the Switch \u201cPro\u201d that it would have 4K capabilities when docked also do not appear to be true. Even the battery seems to be the same as the current model.\nEven with somewhat minimal upgrades, even at a higher price, obviously the OLED Switch will sell out quickly when it arrives in October, as even the current base model is often hard to find. And many were wondering if Nintendo would actually debut new hardware at all this year in the midst of a global chip shortages affecting all manner of electronics across a broad range of industries, but here we are.\nI find this kind of weird, to be honest, not what I was expecting from a \u201cPro,\u201d but certainly nice quality of life features all the same. And it wouldn\u2019t be Nintendo unless they were shrugging off expectations and doing their own thing in one way or another.\nFollow me\u00a0on Twitter,\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nSubscribe to my free weekly content round-up newsletter,\u00a0God Rolls.\nPick up my sci-fi novels the\u00a0Herokiller series, and\u00a0The Earthborn Trilogy, which is also on\u00a0audiobook.\nI\u2019ve been writing about video games, television and movies for Forbes for over 10 years, and you may have seen my reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.

Aussi, malgr\u00e9 une refonte de fa\u00e7ade, la machine du constructeur japonais a-t-elle de r\u00e9els avantages \u00e0 faire valoir\u00a0?\nC'est ce que nous allons tenter d'entrevoir dans cet article...\nAussi, Nintendo ne mise plus sur un rendu exceptionnel pour ses exclusivit\u00e9s depuis l'av\u00e8nement de la Wii. Comme quoi, un hardware moins performant que la concurrence n'emp\u00eache pas le succ\u00e8s...\nTelle que Nintendo la pr\u00e9sente, la Switch OLED semble plut\u00f4t s'adresser aux habitu\u00e9s de la marque qui ont tendance \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier le jeu en mode nomade. Cet usage est d'ailleurs le c\u0153ur de cible de la firme nippone, comme le montre l'ajout d'un large support ajustable, permettant de poser la console un peu partout. Il faut dire que les optimisations de l'exp\u00e9rience sur t\u00e9l\u00e9viseur, via le nouveau dock, se r\u00e9sumeront \u00e0 une connexion internet plus stable via le port Ethernet\u2026 Et notons au passage que la fameuse station sera aussi vendue s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour permettre aux propri\u00e9taires de la Switch actuelle de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cet ajout. Inutile de racheter la console avec donc.\nLes autres, et notamment les nouveaux-venus, risquent toutefois d'\u00eatre dissuad\u00e9s par le tarif \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la machine (environ 359 \u20ac) pour un \u00ab\u00a0simple \u00e9cran plus grand\u00a0\u00bb. Finalement, Nintendo ne chercherait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 faire les yeux doux aux joueurs qui seraient rest\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne Switch mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 consolider sa base de fid\u00e8les. C'est un fait, les fans sont parfois pr\u00eats \u00e0 payer le prix fort pour obtenir la meilleure exp\u00e9rience possible sur leur console de pr\u00e9dilection.\nLe point positif, c'est que nous pouvons aller jusqu'\u00e0 esp\u00e9rer une baisse des prix sur la premi\u00e8re Switch (et pourquoi pas sur la Lite) avec la venue de cette it\u00e9ration OLED\u2026 Presque tout le monde y trouverait alors son compte.\nAu final, une hypoth\u00e8se reste sur table... Et si la nouvelle Switch que nous venons de d\u00e9couvrir n'\u00e9tait qu'un mod\u00e8le de transition avant une v\u00e9ritable version plus performante\u00a0? C'est une possibilit\u00e9, car cette console s'appelle toujours Nintendo Switch et le terme \u00ab\u00a0OLED\u00a0\u00bb est notifi\u00e9 entre parenth\u00e8ses. Nous sommes donc bien face \u00e0 la Switch initiale, sensiblement revisit\u00e9e.\nAinsi, rien n'indique qu'un mod\u00e8le boost\u00e9 (et 4K) n'est plus dans les tuyaux du constructeur \u00e0 l'heure actuelle. Surtout que l'annonce de ce mardi sort un peu de nulle part, ne se greffant \u00e0 aucun \u00e9v\u00e9nement plus large, comme l'E3 par exemple.\nLe contexte mondial particulier que nous traversons peut \u00e9galement expliquer, en partie, cette strat\u00e9gie. De nombreux composants sont en effet touch\u00e9s par des p\u00e9nuries massives et Nintendo pourrait simplement ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de lancer proprement sa machine cette ann\u00e9e. Si bien qu'il ne serait pas \u00e9tonnant de voir la Switch Pro \u00eatre renomm\u00e9e \u00ab\u00a0Nintendo Switch 2\u00a0\u00bb, si sa sortie venait \u00e0 \u00eatre repouss\u00e9e de quelques ann\u00e9es encore (et \u00e0 condition d'y inclure de vraies nouveaut\u00e9s marquantes cette fois).\nNo\u00ebl 96. Plein d\u2019espoir, un pr\u00e9-adolescent ouvre f\u00e9brilement le cadeau qu\u2019il a rep\u00e9r\u00e9 au pied du sapin. Le paquet est certes de taille modeste, mais il attire bien plus son attention que les gros parall\u00e9l\u00e9pip\u00e8des bariol\u00e9s qui tr\u00f4nent aux alentours, d\u2019autant que son patronyme y appara\u00eet clairement en lettres capitales\u2026\nSi Sony se d\u00e9fend de toute \u00ab course aux acquisitions \u00bb, le rachat de Nixxes Software suit de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s celui d'Housemarque.\nXbox ne pr\u00e9voit pas d'annonce de nouvelle console ou de mise \u00e0 jour mat\u00e9rielle dans un futur proche, ni en 2021 ni en 2022.\nLe TPS Scars Above, m\u00e9lange de jeux de combats et d\u2019\u00e9nigmes, d\u00e9voile son univers de science-fiction et son gameplay \u00e0 travers une vid\u00e9o d'une petite dizaine de minutes."

                    "value": "Everything you need to know about the Nintendo Switch OLED and why it's not the Nintendo Switch Pro ... [+] everyone was hoping for.\nNintendo announced the Nintendo Switch OLED model today, noting several times in the press release that the new screen will feature \u201cvivid colors and crisp contrast.\u201d\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the new hybrid Nintendo console.\nFirst and foremost, this is not a Nintendo Switch Pro. It won\u2019t play games with higher frame-rates or graphical fidelity. There is no 4K mode. All the stuff we were hoping to see in a Pro model? Sorry, none of that is happening beyond the nicer screen. That might be disappointing to some\u2014I know I\u2019m a bit disappointed\u2014but the screen really does sound like a pretty major improvement.\nOkay, tell me about the screen.\nSure. The new OLED screen is going to make games look better. For one thing, it\u2019s 7 inches (instead of 6.2\u201d) from corner-to-corner, adding valuable screen real estate in handheld mode. That\u2019s where this slightly-larger Switch is really going to shine.\nWhat makes OLED screens so great is the contrast. Every single pixel can turn off or on individually, which means blacks are much darker and images appear much more vivid as a result. I have an LG OLED TV and it\u2019s gorgeous. Many people now have OLED screens on their mobile devices now as well. The OLED screen will bring the Nintendo Switch into the modern era...mostly. Just not if you want 4K or 60 frames-per-second.\nThese sound symbols prove that the OLED Switch has better speakers.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED features improved audio in handheld mode, so your games won\u2019t just look better they\u2019ll sound better also. Never discount the importance of audio improvements to video games, though you\u2019re still probably better off with a headset.\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED vastly improves the design of the tabletop-mode stand which was pretty flimsy in the original model. Here\u2019s a pic:\nThat\u2019s a major improvement and should make tabletop mode much more viable. Not sure how much people actually use that mode, but with a larger screen and a better stand it\u2019s at least more viable.\nFinally, for TV mode\u2014with the Switch OLED docked and hooked up via HDMI to a TV\u2014there\u2019s now a LAN port so that you can hardwire your Switch to the internet instead of relying on WiFi only. That\u2019s great for competitive online games and for anyone with shoddy WiFi.\nAs you can see, the screen is bigger and there\u2019s a LAN input and it weights just a tiny bit more, but mostly it\u2019s the same machine. Mostly.\nIf you can even find one of these at launch\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up\u2014the MSRP is $349.99. Of course we live in a very silly timeline and scalpers have super-powered AI bots to do their bidding, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see these sell for way more than MSRP. Don\u2019t buy into that crap.\nMy recommendation? Hold out and wait for the price to return to normal.\nNo, of course not. A fool and his money are soon parted, as the saying goes, but if you want to drop $500 on one of these instead of waiting a few months go for it. I wouldn\u2019t advise it but when have you ever listened to me in the first place?\nExactly.\nI have another question.\nYeah okay, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. Ask away.\nIt\u2019s kind of a big one.\nYep, go for it.\nThat\u2019s a great question, you\u2019re very smart to ask it.\nThank you.\nAnd very attractive, I might add.\nYou\u2019re too kind.\nNo seriously, it really is a very smart question. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have an answer for you. Joy-Con drift continues to plague Switch consoles everywhere and it\u2019s super frustrating. Even the Nintendo Switch Lite, which doesn\u2019t have detachable Joy-Con controllers, suffers from drift. My guess is that the OLED version doesn\u2019t fix the problem, especially since it\u2019s compatible with previous Joy-Cons. But I want to believe.\nI also want to believe.\nWell we can believe together and then later we can suffer together when our hopes are crushed and our dreams are dashed. Any other questions?\nYes! At launch, there will be a neon blue/red model and a black and white model. You can see that black and white model in action at the top of this post and it is\u2014if I may be so bold\u2014very sexy.\nYou may be so bold.\nThank you, that\u2019s very kind of you.\nI mean, I agree it\u2019s very sexy. For a video game console.\nI have another question.\nShoot.\nNintendo hasn\u2019t announced one but it\u2019s basically a no-brainer at this point so I would count on it\u2014probably in 2022 or maybe even by the holiday season. I imagine it would feature a slightly bigger screen than the current model with \u201cvivid colors and crisp contrast.\u201d\nThat\u2019s also pretty sexy. When you talk about vivid colors and crisp contrast, I mean.\nHa, thanks. Anything else?\nThat about does it. I guess I just need to know the release date.\nSure, no problem. The Nintendo Switch OLED Model with its vivid colors and crisp contrast will release on October 8th alongside Metroid Dread, the first 2D Metroid game in nearly 20 years.\nOkay, stop it, that just makes me feel old.\nYou and me both, pal. You and me both.\nOkay we\u2019re getting way off topic here, but sure that was a great video game console. My very first game console actually. If that\u2019s all the questions\u2014\n\u2014okay, har har har. You got me.\nNow if that\u2019s all the questions I think it\u2019s time we ended this post. It\u2019s gone on long enough and then some. If you do want to know more about the Switch OLED I made a video about it which you can watch below.
